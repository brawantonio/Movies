 I don't know, dude. 
 B minus in geometry, yo!   This shits the bomb! 
 CLAY (CONT'D) Add it up, son. Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line. 
 Oh my God, Joni, there are so many hotties in your class. You are so gonna hook up the first week. 
 Just cause you're a 24 hour drive- thru doesn't mean everyone else has to be... 
 Hey, she worked her ass off! She deserves some hot jock sausage! Jai looks repulsed, and hurt. 
 SASHA (CONT'D) (flip) Whatever. Why don't you guys just do it and get it over with? 
 SASHA (CONT'D) What? I'm just asking. 
 Uh, maybe because we're friends... 
 Oh, really...? Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur. 
 CLAY'S FATHER Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch. 
 Let me go! 
 CLAY'S FATHER Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. 
 Dad, your pits smell like burnt ass! Get off me! As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son, we note a trace of longing on his face. 
 Laser!   Knock it off! 
 What?!   I'm not doing anything. 
 Don't worry. We just started. 
 Honey, that's disgusting.   We're eating. 
 Did you do that laparoscopically? 
 NIC (CONT'D) Hey, whose truck is that? 
 Mine. NIC Yours? 
 For the business. 
 (protective) Isn't it landscaping. 
 Yes, thank you very much. 
 I didn't look, honey. 5. 
 Hey, what's up? 
 Laser, no phone calls at the table. 
 (into phone) Lemme hit you back. 
 Nobody.    Clay. 
 Can I ask you something? What do you get from your relationship with Clay? 
 What do you mean, "get"? 
 Do you feel like he's the kind of person who will help you grow? 
 Mom, you're windshield wiping me. 
 Not yet.   But I will... 6. 
 Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight. 
 Okay, honey. She got it. Let it go. NIC Okay, I'll let it go... (then) I mean, if it was up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank-you notes, they'd just send out good vibes. 
 NIC (CONT'D) I can't believe my baby's 18. 
 I know... 
 Mom... 
 What? Laser looks nervous. 7. 
 Have you thought any more about, you know, making that call...? 
 Yeah.   I don't want to. 
 Okay...I was just wondering if you changed your mind. 
 I haven't. 
 How can you not even be curious? 
 Sorry, Laser. I just don't want to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I don't want to deal with that right now. (co-dependent leak) And also, that could really hurt moms' feelings... 
 God, why do you worry about them so much? They don't even have to know about it! 
 Look, you can do it when you turn 18, okay? 
 I never ask you for anything. 
 Because if I'm starting this business I need something to haul my equipment in. 
 What does that mean? NIC Sweetie, you don't even have any clients yet. 
 Well you're the one who's always telling me to "act as if!" 
 NIC (CONT'D) Look, I'm sorry. It's good you bought the truck. Its proactive. 
 NIC (CONT'D) Hey... 
 NIC (CONT'D) Wanna watch a movie? 
 A movie-movie? 
 Don't focus on it. NIC How about the one with the biker gang? 
 We left it in Hawaii. 
 Sorry.     I couldn't breathe. Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner. The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume. 10. 
 NIC (CONT'D) The whole neighborhood heard that! 
 No, they didn't. 
 How you doing, foxy? 
 Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe. 
 Oh, sorry... 
 No, I like it. It's earthy. 
 What can I say. I've just been out there, you know...hoe-ing. (looking at the seating chart) How's it looking tonight? They stand close to each other, peering at the chart. 
 Gonna be tight. 
 Really... 
 PAUL (CONT'D) Hello. 
 WOMAN'S VOICE Hi, is this Paul Hatfield? 
 It is.   Who's this? 12. 
 WOMAN'S VOICE My name is Wendy Minter. I'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank. 
 Okay.   What can I do for you? 
 I just need to confirm that you donated sperm with us between 1991 and 1993. At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale. 
 Yeah...I did a little bit of that back then... 
 As you know the Cryobank has a confidentiality policy which prohibits us from releasing your identity without your consent. 
 Uh-huh. Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy. 
 (O.S.) Well we've been contacted by a young woman conceived using your semen, and she's asked if you'd be open to having contact with her. 
 You must of figured you'd get a call at some point. 
 Not really. I mean I was 19 when I did it. It was so long ago...I just figured no one actually used my stuff. 
 Why?     I'd use it. 
 (ignoring the innuendo) This is so weird. I mean, a part of me's really curious... 
 So what are you gonna do? 
 I don't know. 
 Hello? 
 Hi, I'm looking for Joni Allgood. 
 This is she... 
 Hi.  This is Paul... (clearing his throat) Uh, your donor...? 
 Oh!   Hi... 
 Is this a good time to talk? 
 (flustered) Yeah... 
 Where are you going?     It's your turn. 
 So... (doesn't know what to say) How are you? 
 I'm good.      How are you? 
 I'm well, thanks. Banal, awkward pause.     Paul jumps in to fill the void. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) So, Wendy at the Cryobank said you call-- Joni cuts in, nervous and businesslike. 15. 
 Actually, my brother   asked if I'd call you because I'm   18 and he's only 15 which is too   young to call-- anyway, he'd like to   meet you...if you want to... 
 (thrown) Your brother? 
 Yeah. Well, technically my half- brother. Each of my moms had a kid, you know, with your sperm... 
 No.   I didn't know. 
 Oh. 
 Both of them? 
 Yeah. 
 Like in two? 
 Uh huh.   Like in gay. 
 Good deal.     I love lesbians. Paul cringes at his lameness.     Joni doesn't know what to say. 
 I just don't want you to have big expectations. 16. 
 Will you quit saying that?    I don't have any expectations. 
 Okay. I'm just saying he might be weird. I mean, he donated sperm... 
 Well if he hadn't done it, you wouldn't be here. So respect, yo! 
- Joni and Laser enter the restaurant.   They look nervous too. 
 Joni.    Hey. Nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you too. Paul holds out a hand to Laser. 
 And Laser, right? 
 Right. 
 Very cool name. 
 Thanks. 17. 
 Thanks for making the trek all the way over here. No one knows what comes next. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) Cool, I got a table set up for us out here... 
 Listen, feel free and ask me anything you want, okay? (off their stares) Or we can just hang out. That's fine too. Whatever you guys want. 
 LASER/JONI Okay. Paul presses on, trying to break the ice. 
 Anything you want to ask me, Laser? 
 I...uh...I didn't really have any specific questions... 
 (helping him out) That's fine. I'd love to know about you guys. What about you, Joni? What are you up to? 
 Uh, well, I just graduated high school. I'm starting college in the fall. 
 Oh yeah?     Congratulations. 18. 
 Joni's the brains in the family. She won a National Merit Scholarship. 
 Shut the front door! 
 Yeah. And she got like an 800 on her Verbal SAT. 
 Okay, Laser... 
 What? I'm just saying you're really smart. 
 No, I just work harder than you. 
 Don't stress it, Laze. School wasn't my thing either and I turned out okay. 
 (re: his name) Laser. 
 I'm sorry. Laser. (beat) So tell me about you, Laser. What are you into? Laser freezes.   So his sister jumps in. 
 Laser's an amazing athlete. 
 Oh yeah? 
 Did you play any sports in school? 
 I played a little basketball in junior high. 19. 
 That's it? 
 Pretty much. The whole "team" thing got on my nerves, you know like, "Hey, let's go kick some ass, man!" What about you? 
 I play some Soccer. Basketball. Baseball. You know, team sports. 
 Hey, I wasn't bagging teams in general. Teams are great. I'm just weird like that. 
 Yeah, I like teams. 
 So this is your place? 
 Yeah, I've been working on it for a while. I also have this organic co- op farm down the road. We use a lot of the stuff we grow there for the restaurant. 
 (excited) That's so cool.      I'm totally into local. 
 (busting her) You are? 
 Uh, yeah Laser! I've been like trying to get moms to buy local for forever. 
 So, like, do you raise pigs and stuff? 
 No.  No pigs... (beat) But it's a great spot. You guys should come check it out sometime. 
 Yeah...Definitely... 
 Is that yours? 
 Yeah.    You like motorcycles? 
 Yeah, but...our moms are kind of anti-motorcycle. 
 And by "kind of" he means they'd kill us if we ever rode one. 
 That's too bad.   They're fun. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) Well it was great to meet you guys. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) I hope this was okay. 
 Yeah...totally...thank you. 
 Really nice to meet you, Laser. 
 Yeah. 
 I just never pictured him that way. I just...I don't know...He was so cool and interesting. I can't believe that was him...He was so nice, you know?... 
 I guess... 
 You guess? 
 Yeah... 
 God, Laser! You're the one that wanted to meet him so bad! 
 I know. 
 Well what did you think of him? 
 I don't know. He seemed kind of into himself. 
 Hey bug, come here. We're watching "Locked Up Abroad: Uganda." 
 I saw it.    It was gnarly. NIC Where are you going? 
 Clay's. 
 I know. 
 Can I have a hug before you go? 
 Mom... 
 Just a quick one.   Please! 
 Hug her.    That's what she's there for. 
 What?    "Are you and Clay fucking?" 
 And what if he is "exploring?" This is the age for that. Why should we care? 
 Look, we don't even know what the deal is. We're jumping to conclusions. NIC I feel like he has so much potential and he's just wasting it. 
 What are you trying to say? 
 It feels like there's some subtext here. 
 I don't know: Like mother like son? Is that it? Both of us aimless, wandering in the darkness, "wasting our potential?" Nic won't go there. 
 Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet. 24. 
 So what were they like? 
 Sweet. They were really good kids. The boy's kind of a sensitive jock and the girl's kind of innocent but whip-smart and super cute. 
 Sounds like you connected. 
 Yeah, we kinda did. 
 Where'd you leave it? 
 We didn't really leave it anywhere. Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a basket of freshly-picked fruits. 
 Hey Paul. Paul leans over the basket. 
 Whatcha got? Oh cool. First strawberries of the season. 
 Don't they look awesome? I thought you should have the first taste. And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves. 25. 
 (mimicking Brooke) "I thought you should have the first taste...of my pussy." 
 Whoa... 
 Dude, I don't think they smoke pot. 
 Hold up. Clay freezes. CLOSE ON a row of sex toys including a fancy pink, Japanese "all-in-one" dildo and a few DVD's. 
 CLAY (CONT'D) Whoa! 
 CLAY (CONT'D) Yo, it's alive! 
 Dude, put it back!! Laughing, Clay throws the dildo back in the drawer.    Then he grabs one of the DVDs and spins back around. 
 Dude, we're watching this. 
 Think the whole thing's like this? 
 Want me to fast-forward? 
 Laser, you left your bike out... 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Laser, is there anything you want to talk about? 
 Like what? NIC Anything.     Anything on your mind. 
 Well there is something. 
 LASER (CONT'D) It's more of a question, really. 
 We won't judge you. Laser looks at his moms.       Nic and Jules brace themselves. 
 Why do you guys watch gay man-porn? Nic and Jules look at each other, thrown. 
 Honey... NIC And secondly, I really don't appreciate you snooping around our room. Was that Clay's idea? I have to say again, I don't like him. He seems untended...! 28. 
 Honey, that's not what he asked-- 
 Well, sweetie, human sexuality is complicated. And sometimes, people's desires can be...counter- intuitive... (soldiering on) For instance, since women's sexual responsiveness is mostly internal, sometimes it's exciting for us to see sexual responsiveness more, you know... (beat) ...externalized. Laser looks at them, still baffled. 
 JULES (CONT'D) Like with a penis. 
 But like, wouldn't you rather watch two women doing it? 
 You would think that. But in most of those movies, they've hired two straight women to pretend and the inauthenticity is just unbeara-- NIC Okay, that's enough! Laser, your mom and I have a sense there's some other stuff going on in your life and we just want to be let in. 
 What do you mean? 
 Are you having a relationship with someone? 
 I just met him once. 
 Did he find you on-line?! 
 What?! NIC Who did you meet once? 
 Paul!    I met him with Joni. NIC Who's Paul?! 
 Why was Joni there?! 
 She set it up. NIC Forget the set-up!   Who is Paul?!! 
 Our sperm donor. Jules and Nic go white. 
 LASER (CONT'D) Wait, did you guys think I was gay?! 
 Look, guys, we understand why you'd be curious about your biological father. That's totally natural. 
 Because we knew you'd be upset. 
 Honey... (to Joni; expressing her upset more calmly) We just wish you'd have included us in your thinking. But what's done is done. You met him, and now you guys can move on-- 
 (sheepish) Actually... (beat) I want to see him again. 
 JULES                             LASER You do?!                         You do?! 
 JONI (CONT'D) (to Laser) Yeah. I was gonna tell you. 
 Of course I know. I don't want to time-share our kids with someone. Especially when it's Joni's last summer home. No way. 
 I know... 
 I'm with you, honey. (then) We're gonna get through this, okay? 
 I love you too, pony. 32. 
 Hi, great to meet you two. 
 I hope the traffic wasn't too bad. 
 No, I've got my bike so...I just sort of weave through. 
 This is for you. I don't know if you guys like wine... Nic takes it. 
 Beautiful house.    How long you guys lived here? 
 Almost ten years. Wait, has it been that long? (rambling nervously) We moved right after Laser broke his leg, I remember that because we had a ramp for a while, so that would have been...ten, no, nine? No, ten years this fall. 
 Okay. 
 You okay? 
 Go easy on the wine, hon.   It's day time. 
 I hope the food's okay. Joni told us you own a restaurant. 34. 
 The food's great. Can't go wrong with salmon and corn. Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note. 
 Well, I always liked food. NIC No, I was asking because I remember reading in your file, back when we were looking for, you know, sperm, anyway, you said you were studying international relations. 
 Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time ago. Yeah, I was considering it, but then I dropped out of school. 
 You dropped out of college? 
 Yeah, it wasn't my thing. 
 It just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while. I mean, I wasn't "doing" anything. I was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas I could've just as easily learned reading a book. Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) I'm not saying higher learning uniformly sucks. I mean, college is great for some people. (MORE) 35. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) Joni, I'm sure you're gonna love it. That's just me. I'm just weird that way. (beat) Which is probably why I ended up in the food-services industry. 
 See what he did there, mom? You said "food-services industry," then he said "food-services industry..." NIC Yeah, I got it, Laser. Thanks. (apropos of nothing) So, Paul, what about your social life? 
 My social life? NIC You know, are you married, divorced, seeing anyone? 
 Mom! 
 No, never been married or divorced. I date a little, but I'm just kind of focused on my work right now. NIC Oh. 
 So, how'd you guys meet? 
 My tongue went numb. 36. 
 Really? 
 Laser, that's not nice. 
 What's not nice is subjecting your kids to the same story 1000 times! 
 (ignoring Laser) What happened to your tongue? 
 I don't know. I just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and I thought I might gag and then, you know... 
 Choke?    Die?... 
 Yeah...exactly... 
 So what'd you do for her? NIC Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get her to relax, talk, move her tongue around. 
 Mom, that's gross! 
 (ignoring Laser, to Nic) Actually, she started teasing me and that really helped. 
 I know. And it worked. You were really funny. NIC You were really pretty. 
 So that's it. My tongue started working again. 
 That's a great story. 
 (beaming) We like it. 
 So Nic, I know you're a doctor. How `bout you, Jules? What do you do? Jules never likes this question. 
 Well, I, you know, I studied architecture in college... 
 Right... 
 But I'm not an architect. I mean I was on my way to becoming one. But I quit before the kids were born. 
 Well, that happens... 
 When they got a little older, I started a Balinese furniture import business... 38. 
 Right on. 
 Yeah.   But that didn't work out. 
 Well, business aren't easy-- 
 Actually, I'm in the process of starting a new business. 
 Good for you. What kind? 
 Landscape design... (before he can respond) But not like a gardener! I mean, yes, there's a gardening component to it, but the real work is to create unique, eco-friendly outdoor spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment. Do you know what I mean? 
 Absolutely. 
 No, she didn't. 
 (blushing) No, mom, I'm sure he wouldn't... 39. 
 (getting upset) No, it's okay... 
 I'm not embarrassed!   Jesus!     Give it a rest already! 
 I'll get the ice-cream. 
 (standing up) I'll help you. 
 (softly) Honey, that's your forth glass. NIC Actually, it's my third.    But thanks for counting. Paul turns to Jules, trying to revive the mood. 
 Hey, I was just thinking. You know, I bought this place last year and the backyard's a wreck. Would you be interested in working on it? 
 (insecure) Oh, that's okay. 
 No, seriously. I don't have time to work on it myself. 40. 
 Thank you. That's really sweet. Why don't you think about it. 
 Why?  I just did. (then) I mean, if you're not up for it that's okay-- 
 (jumping on it) No! I am! (getting excited) I'm up for it!... Jules smiles at Nic: "Isn't this great?   My first client." Nic looks less than pleased. 
 You're unbelievable. You're all over me about getting clients, I finally get one and you're-- NIC He's not just a client, Jules. , He's our sperm donor! Have you ever heard the phrase "Don't Shit Where You Eat?" 
 Yes, and I think it's disgusting. The two separate, go down separate isles.     When they rejoin, Nic is contrite. 
 Yeah, he was working the whole "alternative" thing pretty hard. 
 ...We could do a kind of a Secret Garden thing with trellises and topiary... (clocking his face) ...or something more Asian, minimal, with a rock garden feel. It's up to you... 
 What do you think? 
 Personally, I'm tired of minimal. I'm into more is more. Let's not try to tame the space. I think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund... 
 Fecund? 
 I'm sorry, you know, fertile... 42. 
 No, I love that word. You just don't hear it that often. (thinking) More is more. Yeah. Let's do that. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) What? 
 Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids in your expressions... 
 JULES (CONT'D) You and Laser have the same mouth. 
 You think so? 
 Yeah. The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected. 
 Pretty close. Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules. 
 20-3...match point. NIC So how'd it go today? 
 Great.   We settled on a concept. 43. 
 It's hard to explain. You have to kind of see the space to get it. 
 Mom, settle! I will... 
 Whatever, I have other plans anyway. 
 I said I'd do something with Paul! Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He tosses the racquet on the table and leaves. Nic yells: 
 This may not be a good idea. 44. 
 (O.S.) Are you filming?! 
 (to Laser) He's not gonna make it. (calling to Clay) Clay, you're not gonna make it! 
 I think he may be right, dude. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. 
 Will you quit being a man-gina and run the camera! I'm only doing this once so keep my shit in frame! Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser, wondering why he puts up with this guy. 
 PAUL/LASER ARE YOU OKAY?! 
 Did you get that?! 
 Seriously, dude, are you okay? 
 I'm fucking fine! Fuck! Did you fucking get it?! 
 Maybe next time we can hang out just you and me. 
 Clay's cool. He's just gets a little amped sometimes. 
 That's not amped.    That's being a dick. 
 He's not a dick, that's just his way. 
 Okay...I just didn't like the way he was talking to you. 
 (defensive) Well, you don't know him. 
 (back-peddling) You're right...I don't... 
 Hey, can I ask you a question? 
 Sure. 
 Why'd you donate sperm? 
 Well, it's a lot more fun then donating blood. Laser doesn't laugh.    Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a "non-joke" answer. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) I don't know, I guess I thought, you know, if I can help somebody in need, somebody who wants a baby... 
 So you did it to help people? 46. 
 It was a long time ago... 
 How much did you get paid? 
 Why do you want to know? 
 I'm just curious. 
 I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop. 
 That's it? 
 It was worth more back then.     You know. With inflation... (off Laser's look) Hey, I'm glad I did it... 
 Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox. 
 Must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty? 
 I'm just saying. Spermster's a hottie. Is he single? 
 Okay, first of all, ewww. Second, he's a really good person and I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him with your whore juice. 
 Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta here. You love birds can split my letters... 
 You want to keep playing? 
 Sure. 
 JAI (CONT'D) Sometimes I feel sorry for Sasha, you know... 
 Yeah... 
 It's like she has to sexualize every experience, you know? It's just sad... That stops Joni in her tracks. 
 Yeah, it is. It's really sad. Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it. 
 Wow.    What's this? 48. 
 NIC (CONT'D) I'm sorry I've been such a bitch lately. I know I'm not being my highest self. 
 Yeah, well... 
 NIC (CONT'D) Get in. 
 Oh god, chicken, that's the spot. NIC How's the water? 
 Perfect.    You wanna come in? NIC In a bit.     You enjoy it first. 
 NIC (CONT'D) Oh, I forgot the lavender salts. 
 No, don't stop... 
 NIC (CONT'D) Don't move... 
 Nic?!! 
 Look, I'm gonna go to the nursery in the morning so we should probably make sure you're signed off on the Bougainvillea... 
 JULES (CONT'D) What's that? 
 Strawberry rhubarb pie.      Fresh from my garden. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) Good, huh? 
 Oh my god.     That is criminal. 
 Have more. 
 No, please, just take it away... 
 You had one bite. 
 I have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause that's where it'll end up. 
 Hey now, don't go negative on your ass. 
 So...you're good with the plants? (off his silence) Look, we don't have to do that. We could do go in a totally different direction if you-- 
 No, I'm just thinking. Hang on. (covers his eyes) Yeah, I'm good with the plants. 
 Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence for criticism. 51. 
 I wasn't criticizing you. 
 No, I know...I just... (beat) Sometimes Nic can be a little critical, you know. She's a perfectionist. 
 That doesn't mean you have to be negative. 
 (O.S.) Excuse me, Senora? Hello? 
 What's up? 
 5 o'clock. 
 Yeah.     Okay. 
 Same time tomorrow? 
 Yes!    Same time! 
 JULES (CONT'D) Okay.     I'm gonna take off too... 
 (in Luis's accent) Same time tomorrow? Jules pushes Paul, laughing. 
 That's mean. 
 Here, take this... 
 No! 
 Just give it to the kids. 
 Okay!   God, you're such a pusher! Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost as a mistake. Before they know it, they're making out. 
 JULES (CONT'D) Whoa. I'm sorry. That was...I don't know where that came from... 
 (freaked himself) It's okay... 
 Okay.   I'm gonna go now... 
 Jules...? 
 (overcompensating) ...but I shall return! Jules bolts for the door, clutching her pie.   Paul watches her go, stunned by what just happened. 
 (jumpy) What do you mean? 53. 
 No, we just talked...conceptually. 
 You know, maybe we should lay off the Paul digs a little. NIC Okay.   You're right. 
 And I also think we should start composting. 
 You got your mom's fair skin.     You didn't get my Mediterranean genes... 
 Thanks... 
 JONI (CONT'D) Ugh.    Ignore. 
 Who's that? 54. 
 My mom, Nic. She's making me insane. 
 Why?   What's she doing? 
 She's treating me like I'm 12. It's like she doesn't want to admit I'm an adult. 
 She's your mom.     That's her job. 
 What? To smother me to death? That's not her job. 
 Well, if you want things to be different, you've got to make that happen. That's your job. 
 That jump was cake, dude!    I so could've made it. 
 You were like 20 feet short, dude! There was no way. 
 Yeah, well if Paul wasn't there I could have landed it. That guy creeps me out. 
 Whatever. 
 He's kind of a fag, dude. Tryin' to act all like your dad and shit. 
 Hey buddy.     Good boy. 
 LASER (CONT'D) I've seen this dog around.        I wonder if he's lost. 
 Let's pee on his head. 
 What? Clay unzips his fly.     It's difficult with the plaster cast. 
 LASER (CONT'D) Dude, don't do that. 
 Come on.     Hold him... 
 Dude, Quit it! 
 (mocking) Duuude, quit it! 
 Go!   Run!    Get out of here! 
 Why are you such a fag?! 
 Why are you such a dick?! 
 Here, put this on. Joni takes the helmet and puts it on. Paul fastens the buckle for her. They get on the bike and take off down the hill. 
 Relax. She'll get home when she gets home. 
 NIC (CONT'D) What the fuck...! 
 Mom... 57. 
 I'm a very safe rider... 
 Mom, I'm 18 years old! I won't even be living here in like next month! 
 Yeah, well why don't you get a jump on it and pretend like I'm not! 
 (trying to soften it) You know, Nic. If you eased up on the restrictions, maybe there'd be less tension... NIC (marinated in sarcasm) Really? You think so, Paul?     Is that how it works? Jules walks up to intervene. 
 What's going on? NIC Oh, nothing. Paul's just giving me child-rearing lessons. 
 I was just saying-- 58. 
 I was just making an observation. 
 (patronizing) I know how you feel about them. But I'm an adult now and you have to respect that. Goodnight. 
 Paul? 
 Hey.    What's up? 
 Look, I'm sorry about last night. I'm really embarrassed. 
 Don't be.    She's the one who wigged out. 
 I know, she's just going through a lot of stuff right now... 
 Jules, it's okay.      You don't have to defend her. 
 And look, I just want you to know, about the other day, the kiss, that's not something I...do. 
 Yeah, I sensed that. 
 I just wanted to clear the air. 
 The air is clear. 
 Paul, I can't! 60. 
 You don't want to?! 
 No, I do! It's just... (urgent whisper) I have a guy outside! 
 75                                                              75 
 Oh.   Well.     Hel-lo! 
 What? 
 Nothing. Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some more. 
 (O.S.) Hello?   Excuse me, Senora Allgood?! They stop mid-thrust. 
 You gotta be fucking kidding me! She dislodges from Paul and starts dressing furiously. 
 What's up? 
 Where do you want the stones? 
 (catching her breath) The stones? Over by the fence. 
 JULES (CONT'D) (defensive) What? I was using the bathroom. (then) Do you need to use the bathroom? 
 That's H. 
 I know. 
 Lay-up. 
 Hey, don't take it easy on me cause you're winning-- 
 PAUL (CONT'D) Nobody likes a show-off. 
 Hey, can I ask you a question? 62. 
 Oh god.   Okay. Hit me. 
 When you die do you want to be buried or cremated? 
 That's your question? 
 I want to be cremated. 
 I think I'd rather be buried. 
 Why? That's just taking up more space in the earth. 
 I don't know, something about the idea of being burned into this chalky powder and sprinkled-- 
 What do you care?   You won't even be conscious. 
 That's true. I guess I just want to be in a place where people can visit me. 
 (growing animated) But why?! You'll be dead! You won't even know they're there! 
 God, I love your necklace!   Where'd you get it? 
 I don't know, some flea market-- 63. 
 In Africa? 
 No, more like Pasadena. 
 Well, it's really awesome. Paul saunters up to the table and stands behind Sasha.   He mindlessly places his hand on Sasha's shoulder. 
 Sorry guys, I need to steal Tanya back now. Sasha clocks Paul's hand. She carefully and without looking back places her hand on top of his. 
 That's okay, Paul. 
 (getting up) Well ladies, it was fun talking with you. 
 SASHA/JONI You too. 
 Okay, I'm sorry but your donor daddy is giving me the sex vibe. 
 No he's not. He wouldn't do that. 
 Why not?    He's not my dad. 
 God Sasha, that's totally gross! Not everybody wants to have sex with you, okay? Especially when you act like a slut. 
 Fuck you. 64. 
 Well it makes you seem insecure and desperate. 
 I'm not insecure and desperate! I'm just a normal sexual person! And maybe you'd get that if you weren't so uptight! 
 Fuck you.    I'm not uptight! 
 Oh my god, these heirloom tomatoes are insane. 
 Joni brought some home from Paul's garden the other day. They were huge! 
 So, the kids have been spending time with him? 
 (senses the sarcasm) Well, it's great they like him so much.   You know, you hear these stories about kids meeting their donors and the guys end up being nothing like they were on paper. NIC No, everyone's getting along famously. Apparently Paul can do no wrong... Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm. 65. 
 NIC (CONT'D) Can we get another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet? Jules gives Nic a look.   Joel and Stella feel the tension between them. 
 Hey, have you guys tried those Açai fruit packs? 
 No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods. 
 I know.    Joel's addicted. 
 What I do is I throw one in the blender with some bananas, frozen strawberries and hemp milk and I'll tell you, it's sensational. 
 Honey... 
 (sotto) How about some green tea, honey... Nic slams her glass on the table.   Explodes. 
 Yeah, if you drink a thousand bottles a day! 
 I'm sorry. 
 What the hell is going on with you? 
 No. He's not! 
 Maybe you need to take some time off and recharge. 67. 
 NIC (CONT'D) Look, I'm sorry, I just feel like I'm carrying the whole load here. 
 Because that's the way you like it! That's the way you keep control! 
 Oh come on! You hated it when I worked! You wanted me at home, taking care of the kids. You wanted a wife! 
 You didn't trust any of those nannies! And you sure as hell didn't back my career! 
 Yeah, so you can feel better about yourself! NIC No, so you can feel better about yourself! 
 Are you even attracted to me anymore? 
 Do you still want this? 68. 
 POST - COITUS 82                                                                82 
 God, I feel so drugular right now. (sitting up quickly) I really want a cigarette! Do you have any? I haven't had a cigarette since Laser was born. Do you smoke? 
 Sometimes. But I don't have any here. Want me to run to the store? 
 (bouncing off the walls) Yeah. Wait, no. Don't.     Sorry. 
 JULES (CONT'D) Do you think I'm just like some sad- sack middle-aged lesbian? 
 God, that's it. I was trying to figure out how to describe you to my friends. Thank you. 
 You want to get that? 
 No. I want to get this... 69. 
 Hey, Joni.     I'm here... 
 PAUL (CONT'D) Listen, don't worry about your friend. Jules pales. She mouths: "What are you doing?!"    Paul gesticulates: "I'm sorry!" 
 PAUL (CONT'D) No. Honestly. I didn't even notice... 
 PAUL (CONT'D) Hey, Joni?     Can you hold on a second? 
 Did you go to Home Depot? 
 Yeah.   I just got back. 
 That was fast! 70. 
 Yeah, no lines. 
 What's that look? 
 What look? 
 The look you're giving me right now! 
 That's no look.     That just my face. 
 Look, I'm not gonna play this game with you! You need to keep your judgements to yourself! 
 Senora, I didn't give no looks! 
 I don't ask you why you keep blowing your nose constantly! I mean, if you have a drug problem that's your business... 
 I don't have no drug problem! I have the allergies! 
 Then why are you a gardener?! 
 Cause I love the flowers. 
 Look, this isn't gonna work. I'll pay you through the end of the day and then we're done. 
 NIC (CONT'D) So I was thinking. Maybe it would be nice if we all had dinner at his house sometime. That way, I could get to know him a little better, and I could see all the good work mom's been doing with his backyard. Nic looks at Jules and smiles. Everyone nods.     They recognize this is a big step for Nic. 
 How's it going? 
 Okay... 72. 
 Here, let me help. 
 We can't be doing this... 
 I know... 
 I'm married... 
 ...and the kids... 
 Yeah, and I love Nic. 
 I know... They stare at each other and we cut to... 
 I got you some cigarettes. 
 (ignoring him) Jesus, what's wrong with me? I shouldn't have fired Luis like that. That was totally wrong... 
 Come on. Don't be so hard on yourself. Things get messy sometimes... 
 That wasn't messy. That was fucked up. I'm totally fucked up... 73. 
 I think I'm really falling for you. 
 Paul, don't... 
 Pretty good night. That table had like 5 bottles of wine. 
 Wow.    Yeah. Good night. 
 Joni's pretty. She's got some of your genes. 
 I think she looks more like her mom actually. But thank you. 
 It's cute seeing you in dad mode. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. (lowering voice) It makes me want to fuck you. 
 (uncomfortable) Oh yeah?... 
 Yeah... Tanya moves imperceptibly closer. 74. 
 TANYA (CONT'D) I've been missing our sleep-overs. 
 Yeah, it's been a while. 
 You want to meet up later? 
 Tanya, you're so sexy and beautiful, but I don't think we should do that anymore. 
 What happened? 
 You know, our thing is really fun and easy, but...I don't want to be 50 and still "hanging out." You know? If I really want a family then I have to stop getting in these situations that don't go anywhere. Paul just looks at her.   Tanya gets it. 
 (welling up) Oh. 
 TANYA (CONT'D) Fuck you. 
 I'm gonna do some planting over there so it won't look so bare... 
 NIC (CONT'D) Hey, so how's that guy Luis working out? 
 Oh, I had to fire him. 
 Yeah, he had a drug problem. 
 Blow, I think... 
 Hey Nic, I think you're gonna love this `98 Screaming Eagle. NIC You know what, I think I'm gonna stick with water tonight. But thank you so much. The Allgoods look at Nic: this is a first. 
 NIC (CONT'D) God, Paul, this steak is delicious. What's the seasoning? 
 I just mist it with a little truffle oil. 
 (taken aback by Nic's cheerfulness) Mmm-hmmm. 
 So it's not too rare? NIC No, it's perfect. Juicy. Tender. Exactly what rare's supposed to be. 
 Good. A lot of people in the restaurant order a steak rare and they freak out at the slightest sight of red. NIC Ugh, isn't that annoying? That happens to me all the time when I'm grilling. 77. 
 Don't people know that rare means red? NIC Right?!   It means bloody! 
 Exactly! They should see what rare looks like in Argentina. The cow's practically still mooing. Laser chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in.   Joni tries to insert herself in the conversation. 
 I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos Aires is supposed to be-- 
 Thanks... 
 Oh yeah, you a Joni Mitchell fan? NIC (smug) Not really. We just named our daughter after her. 
 Cool. Right on... 
 I think I have to go with "Blue." Nic raises her hand in a testify. 78. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) Yeah?   You too? 
 I know, it never lets up, you got "River," "California..." 
 "All I Want.." 
 NIC (CONT'D) I am on a lonely road and I am traveling traveling, traveling, traveling/Looking for something, what can it be/Oh I hate you some, I hate you some/I love you some Oh I love you/when I forget about me... 
 NIC (CONT'D) I want to talk to you/I want to shampoo you/I want to renew you again and again/Applause, applause/ Life is our cause/When I think of your kisses/My mind see-saws... 
 NIC (CONT'D) Do you see/do you see/do you see how you hu-urt me baby/so I hurt you too/then we both get/soo-ooo- ooo blue... 79. 
 Don't quit your day job, mom. 
 Hey. It's hard enough to open your heart in this world. Don't make it harder. 
 You're right. (to Nic; contrite) I'm sorry, mom. Nic looks at Paul.    Stunned.   Then looks at Jules and points to Paul. 
 You didn't tell me you were named after Joni M. 
 It's just so dorky. I don't really like to bring it up. 
 I think it's cool. NIC (getting up) Hey Paul. Where's your bathroom? 
 Just around there. 
 NIC'S POV: Paul and Jules talking comfortably. 
 (through the sonic buzz) Well, you and Paul seemed to get on like gang-busters... 
 (freaked) What? 
 Where is this coming from?! 
 (scrambling) What? I was working.    I got dirty so I took a shower. NIC Oh yeah?   You take a nap, too? 
 No! NIC What, are you straight now?! 
 No. It has nothing to do with that! (MORE) 82. 
 JULES (CONT'D) (beat) I've just felt so cut off from you lately... NIC Oh, right, so it's my fault! 
 No! Who said anything about fault? Just listen to me! 
 I just needed... NIC What?   To be fucked? 
 No, appreciated! 
 He's not just "other people!" 
 Where are you going?! NIC I need water! My mouth is dry! 
 Hey Laser.     Honey? 
 What? 
 Listen, I know you and Joni heard what's going on. I just want you to know that what happened with Paul and me is over. There's nothing going on now. 
 Okay. 
 I know you might need some time to process your feelings around this, but I just want you to know that I'm here for you if you want to talk about anything. (beat) Is there anything you want to talk about? 
 (leave my room) Not really. 
 (fighting the impulse to push it) Okay then. Go back to sleep. 
 Joni? 84. 
 I don't want to talk to you. 
 Can we just-- 
 I said I don't want to talk to you!! 
 Okay.   I'm sorry. 
 How's Nic doing? 
 She's a wreck. I've never seen her like this before. 
 Is it him...? 
 (cold) Hello. 85. 
 Hey Joni, how you doing? 
 You're such a phony. 
 Excuse me? 
 You act like you're so groovy and together but you're not. You're a shitty person! 
 What happened? 
 With my mom?! 
 Listen, can I just come and talk with you-- 
 What's wrong with you?! 
 Joni... 
 Don't call me anymore. Joni hangs up and start crying.    Sasha hugs her. 
 Hey Paul, look at these cukes... 86. 
 Hey, it's me. I just talked to Joni. Conversation intercut. 
 Oh my god, I'm so sorry.   I should have called you. Jules sucks a big, anxious drag off a cigarette. 
 What happened? 
 Nic saw my hair in your bathroom. 
 The other night. 
 Yeah. 
 Fuck... 
 Yeah. Beat. 
 Listen, it's all out in the open now. Let's make this happen. 87. 
 Paul... 
 No, I'm serious. Fuck it. Let's get the kids together and do this thing. 
 Paul, come on... 
 No! I'm sick of this life. I want a family. I'm ready-- 
 (eye rolling) Jesus, Paul! I'm gay! 
 Slow down, tiger. 
 I like the scruff.   It's sexy. 
 Uh, `scuuuse me... 
 You're excused. (then back to Jai) Hey, can I talk to you? 
 Joni...Joni... 
 What? 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine... Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her wake. 
 Just getting another pillow.   The couch is kind of saggy. 
 It's a little ache-y. NIC You should take some Advil. 
 Hey.    How was the party? 
 Fine. 
 How big was it? 
 I don't know. Medium...ish... 
 Are you drunk? 
 No. Nic enters from the stairs, having caught the last piece. 
 Why?    I'm not drunk. 
 Yeah, well, you should know. NIC (furious; incredulous) What did you just say to me?! 
 I'm going to bed. 
 What do you want from me?! I did everything you wanted! I got all A's! I got in everywhere I applied! Now you can show everybody what a perfect family you have! 
 Don't talk to your mom like that! Joni spins to face Jules. 
 You're really gonna tell me how to act? Now?! 
 Hey, I'm still your mother. 
 Whatever... 
 JONI (CONT'D) Don't touch me! 
 JONI (CONT'D) I'm so sick of both of you! 
 Yeah. NIC Well, we can always get stuff up there, too, if you need it, I mean if the room's dark or you need extra bedding... 
 I'm not going to Siberia, mom. 
 I can't believe this is our last dinner together. 
 Oh God, are you gonna cry? 
 I wish you were gay.    You'd be so much more sensitive. 
 It's probably Sasha.    I'll get it. 
 JONI (CONT'D) (shocked) What are you doing here? 92. 
 I needed to talk to you before you left. 
 There's nothing to talk about. 
 I just want to apologize again for what happened. I can't tell you how much I regret it. 
 So like, everything that happened between us. What was that? Was that just bullshit?! 
 No, it wasn't bullshit at all. I know I don't seem credible right now but I really care about you... Paul struggles to keep his emotions in check. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) ...and I just hope someday we'll be able to see each other again. Do you think that could maybe happen? 
 I don't know... Joni looks down welling up. 
 JONI (CONT'D) I just wish you could've been... 
 What? 
 Better... 
 Nic, hold on... 
 Well, they're kinda my... 
 I didn't mean to hurt anyone... Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace. 
 I need to say something. 94. 
 JULES (CONT'D) Look, it's no big secret your mom and are in hell right now. Bottom line...marriage is hard...really fucking hard. Just two people, slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing. It's a fucking marathon, okay?! Everyone is silenced by the outpouring.   Jules soldiers on. 
 JULES (CONT'D) So sometimes you're together so long, you just stop seeing the other person. You just see weird projections of your own junk. And instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails, and act grubby and make stupid choices. Which is what I did. And I feel sick about it because I love you guys and I love your mom and that's the truth. Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most. I don't know why. Maybe if I read more Russian novels I would... 
 JULES (CONT'D) Anyway, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about what I did and that I hope you'll forgive me eventually. (awkward) Thank you. 
 Guys, it's okay.   I got it. 
 Where'd you go?! 
 I thought you left. 
 We wouldn't leave without saying goodbye. 
 It's gonna be weird not having you at home. 
 Sorry to leave you alone with them. 
 It's okay.     I can handle it. Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni, tears streaming down their faces. 97. 
 Guys, come on... (beat) Look, I'll talk to you soon. 
 I don't think you guys should break up. A long beat.

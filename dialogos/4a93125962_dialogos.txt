 (V.O.) Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff of legend. 
 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) He traveled the land in search of worthy foes. 
 (to warrior) I see you like to CHEW! (beat) Maybe you should chew on my FIST!! 
 (V.O.) The warrior said nothing for his mouth was full. Then, he swallowed. 
 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) And then, he spoke. 
 (dubbed hero voice) Enough talk. Let's FIGHT! 
! 
 (V.O.) He was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness. 
 
! 
 HE'S TOO AWESOME! 
 And ATTRACTIVE! 
 How can we repay you?? 
 There is no charge for awesomeness, or attractiveness. 
 
! 
 (V.O.) It mattered not how many foes he faced. They were no match for his bodacity. 
 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) Never before had a panda been so feared... and so loved. (MORE) 
 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) Even the most heroic heroes in all of China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master. 
 We should hang out. 
 Agreed. 
 (V.O.) But hanging out would have to wait. `Cause when you're facing the ten thousand demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters. And that's-- 
 Po! Get up! 
 You'll be late for work! 
 Whu? 
 PO'S DAD (O.S.) Po! Get up! 
 Uh, nothing! 
 PO (CONT'D) Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress! Rowrrrr... 
 PO'S DAD (O.S.) Po! Let's go! You're late for work! 
 Coming! 
 Sorry, Dad. 
 PO'S DAD Sorry doesn't make the noodles. 
 Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy dream. 
 PO'S DAD About what? 
 Huh? 
 PO'S DAD The dream. What were you dreaming about? 
 What was I... eh, I was dreaming about uh... heh... 
 PO (CONT'D) Noodles. 
 PO'S DAD Noodles. You were really dreaming about noodles? 
 Uh, yeah. What else would I be dreaming about? 
 PO (CONT'D) (to customer) Careful, that soup is... sharp! 
 PO'S DAD Oh, happy day! My son, finally having the noodle dream! 
 Uh...a sign of what? 
 PO'S DAD You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient Soup." And then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant, just as I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father, who won it from a friend in a game of mahjong. 
 Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream. 
 PO'S DAD No, it was the dream. We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins. 
 But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno, want to do something else? Something besides noodles? 
 PO'S DAD Actually... 
 So why didn't you?! 
 PO'S DAD Oh, because it was a stupid dream. Can you imagine, me making tofu? (laughs at the thought) No. We all have our place in this world. Mine is here. And yours is-- 
 I know. Is here. 
 PO'S DAD No, it's at tables two, five, seven, and twelve. 
 Well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Tigress, you need more ferocity. Monkey, greater speed. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Crane - height. Viper - subtlety. Mantis-- 
 Master Shifu! 
 (impatiently) What?! 
 (startled) Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you. 
 Master Oogway? You summoned me. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Is something wrong? 
 So... nothing's wrong? 
 You were saying? 
 That is impossible. He is in prison. 
 Zeng! 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons. Double everything! Tai Lung does not leave that prison! 
 Yes, Master Shifu. 
 We have to do something. We can't just let him march on the valley, and take his revenge! He'll, he'll-- 
 The Dragon Scroll... 
 But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power? To become...the Dragon Warrior?! 
 Oop...sorry. 
 Hey! Watch it, Po! 
 Sorry. Suck it up. 
 Ugh! 
 Oop! Sorry! A thousand pardons. 
 PO (CONT'D) What?! Master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today! 
 PO (CONT'D) Everyone! Everyone! Go! Get to the Jade Palace! 
 PO (CONT'D) One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll! 
 PO (CONT'D) We've been waiting a thousand years for this! Just take the bowl! 
 PO (CONT'D) This is the greatest day in Kung Fu history! Don't worry about it, just go! 
 PO'S DAD Po! Where are you going? 
 To the...Jade Palace? 
 PO'S DAD But you're forgetting your noodle cart! The whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them. 
 Selling noodles? But Dad, you know, I was kinda thinking maybe I... 
 PO'S DAD Yeah? 
 I was kinda thinking maybe I... 
 PO'S DAD Uh huh? 
 ...Could also sell the bean buns. They are about to go bad. 
 PO'S DAD That's my boy! I told you that dream was a sign! 
 Yeah, ha ha, glad I had it. 
 #1 Yippee! 
 #2 I'm a Kung Fu warrior! 
 #1 Me too! 
 Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost there... 
 PO (CONT'D) What? No! Oh No! 
 Sorry, Po. 
 We'll bring you back a souvenir. 
 No. I'll bring me back a souvenir. 
 It is an historic day, isn't it, Master Oogway? 
 Yes, Master Oogway. 
 Let the tournament begin! 
 (out of breath) Yeah! 
 PO (CONT'D) Oh no! No no no! Wait! I'm coming! 
 PO (CONT'D) Hey! Open the door! 
 PO (CONT'D) Let me in! 
 Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It is my great honor to present to you... Tigress! Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five! 
 The Furious Five! 
 Warriors prepare! 
 Peeky-hole! 
 Ready for battle! 
 Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of Fire! 
 Whoa! Look at that. 
 Hey, get out of the way! 
: 
 PO (CONT'D) Ow... 
. 
 And finally...Master Tigress! 
 SHIFU (O.S.) (CONT'D) And believe me citizens, you have not seen anything yet! 
 I KNOW!! 
 (O.S.) Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death! 
 Citizens of the Valley of Peace! Master Oogway will now choose... the Dragon Warrior! 
 Huh? Oh no! Wait! 
 PO (CONT'D) Yeah! 
 PO'S DAD (O.S.) Po?! 
 What does it look like I'm doing? Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior! 
 PO'S DAD But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream. 
 I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad! 
 PO (CONT'D) I love kung fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu- 
 PO'S DAD Come on, son. Let's get back to work. 
 Okay. 
 PO'S DAD Oh! Come back! 
 Oooh! Aaahh! 
 Uh oh... 
 What's going on? Where...uh? What are you pointing--? 
 PO (CONT'D) Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was. 
 Master, are you pointing at...me? 
 Who--? 
 Me? 
: 
 What? 
 What??? 
 PO'S DAD WHAT???? 
 Stop! Wait! Who told you to--? 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Master Oogway, wait! That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to... our problem. You were about to point at Tigress. That thing fell in front of her. That was just an accident! 
 Forgive us, Master. We have failed you. 
 No. If the panda has not quit by morning, then I will have failed you. 
 Wait wait wait! I bring a message from Master Shifu. 
 What?!?! (reading) "Double the guard?! Extra precautions?! Your prison may not be adequate!" 
 COMMANDER (CONT'D) You doubt my prison's security? 
 Absolutely not. (then) Shifu does. I'm just the messenger. 
 I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu. 
 ON A BRIDGE 
 Escape from Chogun Prison is impossible! 
 Whoa. 
 Impressive, isn't it? 
 Yes, very impressive. It's VERY impressive. 
 One way in, one way out, one thousand guards, and one prisoner. 
 Yes, except that prisoner is Tai Lung... 
 Take us down. 
 What are you doing?! 
 - 
 ZENG (CONT'D) Oh my... 
 Behold, Tai Lung. 
 I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right here. 
 It's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe. 
 Oof! 
 Crossbows! At the ready! 
 Crossbows?! 
 Hey, tough guy, did you hear? Oogway's finally gonna give someone the Dragon Scroll and it's not gonna be you! 
 What are you doing?! Don't get him mad. 
 What's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized. 
 COMMANDER (CONT'D) Awww. Did I step on the witty kitty's tail? Awww. 
 I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing to worry about. 
 No, he doesn't. 
 Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we please go now? 
 (chanting) Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior! 
 Wait a second! Hello? Uh...I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm, uh... 
 PO (CONT'D) Whoa. The Sacred Hall of Warriors. No way! Would you look at this place! 
 PO (CONT'D) 
 (GASP) Master Flying Rhino's Armor! With authentic battle damage! 
 PO (CONT'D) 
 (GASP) The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking-- OW! 
 PO (CONT'D) 
 (GASP) The Invisible Trident of Destiny!? 
 PO (CONT'D) 
 (GASP) I've only seen paintings of that painting... 
 PO (CONT'D) (loudly) Nooo! Ohhhh! 
 PO (CONT'D) The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors! Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu army. (calling into vase) Hellooo? 
 Have you finished sight-seeing? 
 (to vase) Sorry. I should've come to see you first. 
 My patience is wearing thin. 
 (to vase) Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere. 
 Would you turn around? 
 Sure. 
 PO (CONT'D) Hey, how's it going? 
 PO (CONT'D) (to vase) Now how do you get five thousand-- (cutting himself off) Master Shifu! 
 PO (CONT'D) Someone...broke that. But I'm gonna fix it. Do you have some glue? 
 PO (CONT'D) Ow! Ooh. Splinter. 
 So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior. Hmmm? 
 Uh...I guess so? 
 Wrong! You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll. 
 (in awe) Whoa. (then) So how does this work? You have a ladder or trampoline or...? 
 You think it's that easy? That I am just going to hand you the secret to limitless power? 
 No, I... 
 One must first master the highest level of kung fu. And that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you. 
 Someone like me? 
 Yes. Look at you...this fat butt. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Flabby arms... 
 Those are sensitive in the flabby parts. 
 And this ridiculous belly. 
 Hey... 
 --and utter disregard for personal hygiene. 
 (pointing at Shifu) Now wait a minute. That's a little uncalled-for. 
 Don't stand that close...I can smell your breath. 
 Listen...Oogway said that I was the- 
 PO (CONT'D) (gasp) The Wuxi Finger Hold?! Not the Wuxi Finger Hold! 
 (sly) Oh, you know this hold? 
 DevelopedbyMasterWuxiInTheThirdDyna sty-- YES. 
 Oh, then you must know what happens when I flex my pinky. 
 No no no! 
 You know the hardest part of this? The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards... 
 Okay! Okay! Take it easy... 
 Now listen closely, panda. Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you, I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't. Are we clear? 
 Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We are so clear. 
 Good. I can't wait to get started. 
 Let's begin. 
 Wait wait wait...What? Now? 
 Yes...now. Unless you think the great Oogway was wrong, and you are not the Dragon Warrior. 
 Oh, okay. Well-- I don't know if I can do all of those moves. 
 Well, if we don't try, we'll never know will we? 
 Uh, yeah. It's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level. 
 And what level is that? 
 Well, ya know...I'm not a master, but uh, let's just start at zero, level zero. 
 There is no such thing as level zero. 
 Hey! Maybe I can start with that. 
 That? We use that for training children. And for propping the door open when it's hot. But if you insist... 
 Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so much bigger than your action figures -- except for you, Mantis. You're about the same. 
 Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do. 
 Um, are they gonna watch? Or should I just wait until they get back to work or something... 
 Hit it. 
 Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm still digesting... So my kung fu might not be as good as later on. 
 Just hit it. 
 Alright. Whatcha got? You got nothing cause I got it right here. You picking on my friends? Get ready to feel the thunder. I'm comin' at him with the crazy feet. Whatcha gonna do about my crazy feet? I'm a blur. I'm a blur. You never seen bear style, you only seen praying Mantis! OR... I could come at you Monkey style. OR... I'm comin' at ya snikity-snake. 
 Would you hit it! 
 Alright...alright. 
 Why don't you try again?   A little harder... 
 How's tha-- 
 PO (CONT'D) Ow, that hurts. 
 (to the Five) This'll be easier than I thought. 
 Feeling a little nauseous. 
 PO (CONT'D) Ow, those are hard! Ooh! I think I... 
 PO (CONT'D) Oooohoohoo...my tenders. 
 PO (CONT'D) How did I do? 
 There is now a level zero. 
 There's no words. 
 No denying that. 
 I don't understand what Master Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's just gonna get himself killed. 
 (mocking) He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire. 
 When he walks, the very ground shakes! 
 One would think that Master Oogway would choose someone who actually knew Kung Fu. 
 Yeah, or could at least touch his toes. 
 Or even see his toes. 
 Okay. 
 PO (CONT'D) (whispering) Great. 
 PO (CONT'D) Oh hey...hi. You're up. 
 Am now. 
 I was just uh... Some day huh? That kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Your biceps sore? 
 Um...I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so uh...yeah, I should probably get to sleep now. 
 Yeah yeah yeah, of course. 
 (relieved) Okay, thanks. 
 It's just...I'm such a big fan. 
 Oop. 
 You guys were totally amazing at the Battle of Weeping River. Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop, and then you just... HI-YAH! 
 PO (CONT'D) Ooo, sorry about that. 
 Look, you don't belong here. 
 I know. I know. You're right. I just - my whole life I've dreamed of- 
 No no no... I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room. This is my room. Property of Crane. 
 Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you want to get to sleep. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm keepin' you up. We got big things tomorrow. Alright. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Okay. Bye bye. 
 PO (CONT'D) What was that? 
 I didn't say anything. 
 Okay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep well. 
 PO (CONT'D) Seemed a little bit awkward. 
. 
 PO (CONT'D) Master Tigress! Didn't mean to wake you. Just uh... 
 You don't belong here. 
 Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course. This is your room. 
 I mean...you don't belong in the Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to Kung Fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning. 
 Big fan... 
 (mouth full) Is that what this is? I am so sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree. 
 Upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset? 
 I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu, in the history of China, in the history of sucking. 
 And the Five... man, you should have seen them, they totally hate me. 
 How's Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior? I mean, I'm not like The Five. I've got no claws, no wings, no venom. Even Mantis has those... (he imitates a mantis' front legs) ...thingies. Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles. 
 OOGWAY (CONT'D) You are too concerned with what was and what will be. There is a saying: Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present. 
 What's happening?! 
 Fire Crossbows! 
 Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu! 
 You're not going anywhere. And neither is he. 
 Let go of me! 
 (to guards) Bring it up! 
 #1 Wait! Bring it back! 
 He's coming this way! 
 He won't get far. (to guards) Archers! 
 We're dead. So very, very dead. 
 (to Goose) Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now! 
 Can we run now? 
 Yes. 
 Nuuu... Urggg... 
 ZENG (CONT'D) 
! 
 I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was beginning to think I had been forgotten. 
 Panda! Panda, wake up! 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) (satisfied) Hmm. He's quit. 
 What do we do now, Master? With the panda gone, who will be the Dragon Warrior? 
 All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed. 
 What are you doing here?! 
 Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I thought I'd warm up a little. 
 You're stuck. 
 Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck... Yeah, I'm stuck. 
 (to Crane) Help him. 
 Oh dear. 
 Maybe on three. One. Two- 
 PO (CONT'D) Threeeee. Thank you. 
 Don't mention it. 
 No really, I appreci-- 
 --EVER. 
 You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night? It takes years to develop one's flexibility and years longer to apply it in combat. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones. 
 Yeah, excellent! 
 Let's get started. 
 
 Are you ready? 
 I was born ready-- 
 PO (CONT'D) Eaghhh... 
 I'm sorry, brother! I thought you said you were ready! 
 That was awesome! Let's go again. (salutes) 
 I've been taking it easy on you, panda, but no more! Your next opponent... will be me. 
 Alright! Let's go! 
 (to Po) Step forth. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness and make him suffer for it. 
 (delighted) Oh, yeah! 
 To take his strength and use it against him. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) --until he finally falls, or quits. 
 But a real warrior never quits. Don't worry, Master, I will never quit! 
 If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps. 
 But he will. 
 He's not gonna quit, is he? 
 He's not gonna quit bouncin', I'll tell ya that. 
 (O.S.) Aaaoo...whoohoo...EEEee...hee- hee... I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better. 
 Trust me, it will. It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this-- 
 Fat? 
 Fur, I was gonna say fur. 
 Sure you were. 
 Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? I mean -- look at me. 
 MANTIS (O.C.) (CONT'D) I'm over here. 
 Ow! 
 Maybe you should take a look at this again. 
 (re: diagram) Oh! Okay. 
 Ow! Don't... (laughing) Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master Shifu's trying to inspire me and all, but if I didn't know any better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me. 
 I know he can seem kind of heartless-- 
 MANTIS (CONT'D) But, ya know, he wasn't always like that. 
 According to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 But that was before... 
 Before what? 
 Before Tai Lung. 
 Uh yeah, we're not really supposed to talk about him. 
 Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know. 
 (trying to ease the tension) Guys, guys. I know about Tai Lung. 
 PO (CONT'D) He was a student, the first ever to master the thousand... 
 PO (CONT'D) (nervously trailing off) ...scrolls of... kung fu... and... then he turned bad... and now he's in jail. 
 He wasn't just a student. 
 (V.O.) Shifu found him as a cub. And he raised him as a son. 
 TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and when the boy showed talent in Kung Fu... 
 TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...Shifu trained him. 
 TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D) He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness. 
 TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was never enough for Tai Lung. He wanted the Dragon Scroll. But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused. Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley. He tried to take the scroll by force. And Shifu had to destroy what he had created. 
 TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D) But how could he? 
 TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D) Shifu loved Tai Lung like he'd never loved anyone before... 
 TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...or since. 
 And now he has a chance to make things right, to train the true Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with you: a big, fat panda who treats it like a joke. 
 Doieeeee... 
 (charging at Po) Oh! That is it! 
 Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve. 
 MANTIS (CONT'D) And may have also stopped his heart. 
 Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Would whoever is making that flapping sound, quiet down! 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Inner... 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use some good news right now. 
 Uh... 
 Master! Master! 
 (out of breath) I have-- it's-- it's very bad news. 
 Master, your vision...your vision was right. Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way! 
 OOGWAY (CONT'D) ...If you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him. 
 The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior. (MORE) 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) He wasn't even meant to be here -- it was an accident! 
 Yes, I know. You've said that already. Twice. 
 Thrice. 
 Illusion? 
 But there are things we can control. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) I can control when the fruit will fall. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) And I can control-- 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) --where to plant the seed. That is no illusion, Master. 
 But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung! 
 But how? How? I need your help, Master. 
 I... I will try. 
 What... what are you..? 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Master, you can't leave me! 
 Master! 
 (O.S.) ...So I'm like, fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province... 
 ...but you're a lousy tipper. 
 (incredulous) Really? So... how'd you get out of there alive? 
 I mean, I didn't actually say that, but I thought it... in my mind. 
 PO (CONT'D) (covering) If he... could read my mind, he'd have been like, "What?" (then) Order up! 
 PO (CONT'D) Hope you like it. 
 This is really good. 
 (bashful) No, c'mon. (MORE) 
 PO (CONT'D) You should try my dad's secret ingredient soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient. 
 What are you talking about? This is amazing. 
 Wow, you're a really good cook. 
 I wish my mouth was bigger. 
 Tigress, you gotta try this. 
 It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe. 
 I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna need a lot more than dew. And, uh, universe juice. 
 PO (CONT'D) What? 
 Oh, nothing... Master Shifu! 
 (imitating Shifu) You will never be the Dragon Warrior, unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth! 
 PO (CONT'D) (imitating Shifu) What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it! 
 PO (CONT'D) (imitating Shifu) Work hard, Panda. And maybe, someday... you will have ears like mine. 
 PO (CONT'D) (normal) Ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good. 
 It's Shifu. 
 Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing? 
 PO (CONT'D) Ooh! Master Shifu! 
 You think this is funny? Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children! 
 What? 
 He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him. 
 And here I am saying you got no sense of humor. I'm gonna stop Tai... 
 PO (CONT'D) What? You're serious? And I have to-- uh, Master Oogway will stop him! He did it before, he'll do it again. 
 Oogway cannot, not anymore. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior. 
 The panda? 
 Yes, the panda! 
 Master, please. Let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for. 
 No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung. It is his. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Where'd he go? 
 You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits! 
 Watch me! 
 PO (CONT'D) Come on! How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs. 
 You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior! 
 Ow! You don't believe that! You never believed that! From the first moment I got here, you've been trying to get rid of me. 
 Yes. I was. But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine. 
 You're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior. 
 Then why didn't you quit? You knew I was trying to get rid of you, and yet you stayed. 
 Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt. But it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me. 
 PO (CONT'D) I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me, could make me... not me, it was you. The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China. 
 But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will! 
 C'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here right now. And even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you gonna change this... (indicate belly) ...into the Dragon Warrior? How? How? How?! 
 I don't know!!! (then, resigned) I don't know. 
 That's what I thought. 
 This is what you trained me for. 
 Tigress! 
 Don't try and stop me! 
 We're not trying to stop you! 
 What? 
 We're coming with you! 
 (mouth full) What? I eat when I'm upset, okay? 
 Oh, no need to explain. I just thought you might be Monkey -- he hides his almond cookies on the top shelf. 
 (mouth full) Don't tell Monkey. 
 Look at you. 
 Yeah, I know. I disgust you. 
 No no, I mean... how did you get up there? 
 I don't know. I guess I-- I don't know. I was getting a cookie... 
 And yet you are ten feet off the ground and have done a perfect split. 
 No, this... this is just an accident. 
 There are no accidents. Come with me. 
 I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fu-y, but could you at least tell me where we're going? 
 You dragged me all the way out here for a bath?! 
 Panda, we do not wash our pits in The Pool of Sacred Tears. 
 (in awe) The pool of... 
 This is where Oogway unravelled the mysteries of harmony and focus. This is the birthplace of Kung Fu. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Do you want to learn Kung Fu? 
 (awestruck) Yeah... 
 Then I am your master! 
 Okay! 
 Don't cry. 
 Okay. 
 When you focus on Kung Fu, when you concentrate...you stink. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) But perhaps that is my fault. I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five. I now see that the way to get through to you is with this! 
 Oh great, `cause I'm hungry. 
 Good. When you have been trained, you may eat. Let us begin. 
 After you, panda. 
 Just like that? No situps? No ten mile hike? 
 I vowed to train you... and you have been trained. You are free to eat. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Enjoy. 
 Hey! 
 I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling. 
 Hey! 
 You are free to eat! 
 (upset) Am I? 
 (challenging) Are you?! 
 I'm not hungry... master. 
 Cut it! 
 Where's the Dragon Warrior? 
 How do you know you're not looking at her? 
 You think I'm a fool? I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you! 
 Po? 
 So that is his name -- Po. Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary! 
 We've got this. Help her! 
 Monkey! 
 Go! (then) Ack! What was I thinking?! 
 Mantis! 
 TIGRESS (CONT'D) Now! 
 Shifu taught you well... 
 You have done well, Panda. 
 Done well? Done well?! I've done awesome! 
 The mark of a true hero is humility! 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) But yes...you have done awesome. 
 Huh? Guys? Guys! 
 PO (CONT'D) They're dead? No, they're breathing! They're asleep?! No, their eyes are open. 
 We were no match for his nerve attack. 
 He has gotten stronger. 
 Who? Tai Lung? Stronger? 
 He's too fast! 
 MONKEY (CONT'D) Sorry, Po. 
 I thought we could stop him. 
 He could have killed you. 
 Why didn't he? 
 So you could come back here and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work! 
 Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm pretty scared. 
 You can defeat him, panda. 
 Are you kidding? If they can't-- They're five masters. I'm just one me. 
 But you will have the one thing that no one else does. 
 You really believe I'm ready? 
 You are, Po. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is yours. 
 Wait, what happens when I read it? 
 No one knows, but legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing-beat. 
 Whoa! Really? That's cool. 
 Yes. And see light in the deepest cave. You will feel the universe in motion around you. 
 Wow! Can I punch through walls? Can I do a quadruple back flip? Will I have invisibility-- 
 Focus. Focus. 
 Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah. 
 Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny. Read it and become... the Dragon Warrior! 
 Whooaa!!! 
 PO (CONT'D) It's impossible to open. 
 PO (CONT'D) Come on baby. Come on now... 
 PO (CONT'D) Thank you. I probably loosened it up for you though... Okay, here goes. 
 PO (CONT'D) 
! 
 PO (CONT'D) It's blank! 
 What? 
 Here! Look! 
 No! I am forbidden to look upon-- 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Blank? I don't...I don't understand. 
 Okay. So like, Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all? 
 No. Oogway was wiser than us all. 
 Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me by accident. Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding? 
 But who will stop Tai Lung? 
 He'll destroy everything...and everyone. 
 No, evacuate the Valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage. 
 What about you master? 
 I will fight him. 
 What? 
 I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape. 
 But Shifu, he'll kill you. 
 Then I will finally have paid for my mistake. 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Listen to me, all of you. It is time for you to continue your journey without me. I am very proud to have been your master. 
 We've got to get them out safely. 
 Come, little one. Let's find your mama. 
 Viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north. Crane, light the way. 
 (skeptically) Look, it's the Dragon Warrior. 
 Hey, Dad. 
 PO'S DAD Po! 
 (listlessly) Good to be back. 
 PO'S DAD Let's go Po. So, for our next shop, it's time to face it -- the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables, no longer slices. 
 I don't know, Dad. Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son. 
 PO'S DAD Po, I think it's time I told you something I should have told you a long time ago... 
 Okay. 
 PO'S DAD The secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup! 
 Oh. 
 PO'S DAD C'mere! The secret ingredient is... nothing! 
 Huh? 
 PO'S DAD You heard me. Nothing. There is no secret ingredient! 
 Wait wait...it's just plain old noodle soup? You don't add some kind of special sauce or something? 
 PO'S DAD Don't have to. To make something special, you just have to believe it's special. 
 There is no secret ingredient... 
 I have come home, Master. 
 This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master. 
 Yes. You have a new favorite. So where is this...Po? Did I scare him off? 
 This battle is between you and me. 
 So. That is how it's going to be? 
 That is how it must be. 
 I rotted in jail for twenty years because of your weakness! 
 Obeying your master is not weakness! 
 You knew I was the Dragon Warrior! You always knew... 
! 
 You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault! 
 NOT YOUR FAULT?! 
?! 
 It was never my decision to make! 
 It is now. 
 I would rather die. 
 All I ever did, I did to make you proud! Tell me how proud you are, Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME! 
 (weakly) I have always been proud of you. From the first moment, I've been proud of you. And it was my pride that blinded me. I loved you too much to see what you were becoming. What I was turning you into. I'm... sorry. 
 I don't want your apology. I want my scroll! 
 (weakly) Dragon Warrior has taken scroll halfway across China by now. You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung. Never. Never... 
 (O.S.) Hey! 
 PO (CONT'D) (out of breath) Stairs... 
 Who are you? 
 Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior. (exhales hard) Huhhh... 
 You?! Him?! (to Shifu) He's a panda. (back to Po) You're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me? 
 Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna use this. You want it? Come and get it. 
 Finally! 
 Lightning! 
 The scroll has given him power. (then) 
0!! 
 It's okay. I didn't get it the first time either. 
 (disbelief) What? 
 There is no secret ingredient. It's just you. 
 
! 
 
! 
 PO (CONT'D) Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee! Don't! Don't! 
 (heavy breathing) You... can't defeat me. You're just a big, fat panda! 
 I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the big, fat panda. 
 The Wuxi Finger Hold! 
 Oh, you know this hold? 
 You're bluffing. You're bluffing! Shifu didn't teach you that. 
 Nope. I figured it out. 
 PO (CONT'D) Skadoosh! 
 KA-THOOM! 
 Look! The Dragon Warrior. 
 PO'S DAD That's my boy. That big, lovely kung fu warrior is my son! 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 PO (CONT'D) Hey, guys. 
 Master. 
 (modest) Master? (then, remembering) Master Shifu! 
 Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay? 
 Po! You're alive! (then, darkly) Or we're both dead. 
 No, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung! 
 You did?! 
 SHIFU (CONT'D) Wow. It is as Oogway foretold -- You are the Dragon Warrior. You have brought peace to this Valley. And to me. Thank you. Thank you, Po. Thank you... 
 No! Master! No No No! Don't die, Shifu. Please... 
 (eyes snapping open) I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah, Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at peace. Finally. 
 Oh. So, um, I should...stop talking? 
 If you can. 
 Want to get something to eat? 
 (sighs) Yeah.

 
 Why do I do it? Why do I push myself to my limits - of pain, of exhaustion - every day of my life? Why do I wake up every morning and make the commitment? Why do I do it? 2. 
 MARK (CONT'D) In 13 months - if I train right, if I push myself - I'll be going to Seoul - that's a city in South Korea. Does anyone know why? Because that's where the Olympic games are. 
 MARK (CONT'D) Does anyone know what this is? 
 MARK (CONT'D) Olympic gold medal. I won it three years ago at the `84 Games in Los Angeles. My brother, Dave Schultz - my best friend, my older brother, my best friend - won one too, just 23 hours and 16 minutes before I did. That's unprecedented - two brothers winning at the same Olympics. (THEN) Would you like me to win another one? Would you like me to win another gold medal - for us, for America? Would you like to see me and my big brother - Dave Schultz - both win gold medals? Who here wants to see the two brothers win again? 
 MARK (CONT'D) Well we're going to give it absolutely everything we've got. 
 Twenty... and... no one-hundreds... 
 And this is for the trophy case. 
 I'm sorry?... For what? 
 For the trophy case. 
 (BEAT) With the trophies. 
 It's an elementary school. 
 I'll have a # 4. 
 No. Can I get extra meat on that? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Where's it say that? 
 I always get extra meat. Every time I come here. 
 (V.O.) Coach Teller? This is Mark Schultz-- 
: 
: 
: 
: 
: 
 Where were you today? 
 How far'd you run? Ten? 
 DAVE (CONT'D) More than ten? Dragging weight the whole way? (Dave turns off the water) You're a sick fuck, you know that? 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Place is looking good, by the way. I like what you've done with it. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) You setting up clinics? 
 Talked to some coaches. 
 I hope you don't have anything booked for Saturday. 
 Why? 
 I need a favor. This school called me months ago to do a gig but now I can't. Nancy's got a thing all day so I gotta watch the kids. You free? 
 I'll check. 
 MARK (CONT'D) You said Saturday or Sunday? 
 Saturday. 
 Saturday could work. 
 Good. Thank you. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Coach Vinson, Radnor High. I'll let him know you'll call tomorrow. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) And Mark. Please come back to the gym. You don't have to do anything with the team. Just train with me. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) I need you there. Stay focused on what's important. For both of us. Seoul's the goal. 
 Seoul's the goal. 
 The minute you step on the mat, you are exactly who you are. You can't hide. You can't pretend you trained harder than you did, you want it more than you do. My brother Dave and me care about this more than we care about anything. The difference between the number one guy in the world and the number four guy is paper thin. The one who wins is the one who wants it more, who's willing to sacrifice, who can take the pain. I can take the pain. My brother Dave can take the pain. Can you take the pain? 
 MARK (CONT'D) I talk about all this in my instructional videotape - which you can purchase at the end of the day for a nominal fee. 
 You remember Fred Cole from USA Wrestling. 
 Hey there, Mark, how you been? 
 You been calling me and hanging up? 
 (adjusting his knee brace) No. What do you mean? 
. 
 Sorry about your nose. 
 No, you're not. 
 (BEAT) Come by the house, have dinner with me and Nance and the kids. 
 You win a gold medal for them. And still. Nothing. No respect. 
 Hey. Gimme a hug. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Same time tomorrow. 12. 
. 
 (BEAT) You may also know of him in connection with his support of the Villanova wrestling program. 
 Mr. Schultz, I'm Brandon. Welcome to Philadelphia. 
 Feel free to look around the library. Mr. du Pont will be up shortly. 
 You're actually here. 
 Oh. Yes, sir. 
 In my study. 
 (no idea what to say) They said it was the library. 
 It is. 
 Mark Sch -- 
 - I know who you are - I've watched your Olympic victory enough times to know exactly who you are, every inch of you. Please, put your bag down, make yourself comfortable, sit, make yourself at home - 
 Thank you, sir. I'm proud of that day. 
 You should be. I'm proud of that day. I'm proud of you on that day. Your parents must be enormously proud. 
 (after a moment) To be perfectly honest, we don't often talk. 
 I want to tell you how much I appreciate your coming here. I know it cuts into your training. I imagine that's every day for you? 
 Yes sir, it is. 
 Strength training in the morning? Upper body regimen - muscle tone - building up the muscle tone - across the upper body. In the morning? 17. 
 Oh. Well. I take the mornings on my own - as you said, strength training, endurance - then I meet up with my brother - you know Dave Schultz - ? 
 Of course, of course, yes, I know him. I mean, not personally, but yes, of course, I do know him. 
 - I meet up with him at the U-W gym, we work out whatever free time we can grab between team practice. 
 University of Wisconsin. 
 Yes sir. 
 Where you both coach. 
 Pretty much. 
 I'd like to see you win this upcoming tournament - 
 - Thank you - 
 - I'd like to help you win this upcoming tournament. It's a big one, yes? 
 It's the world championship. 18. 
 Why do you do it, Mark? 
 (simply no other reason) I want to be the best in the world. 
 I want you to be the best in the world. I want this country to be the best in the world. (THEN) May I speak frankly? 
 I started kind of late - high school sophomore. 
 MARK (CONT'D) I was... well, truthfully, I was... kind of lost. And I got into it `cause my brother was wrestling. He convinced me to give it a try. I never told him this, but I was scared of losing in front of him. So of course my first match I get put up against a kid two years older. Dave was helping coach from my corner... and at the end, when the ref raised my hand... (MORE) 19. 
 MARK (CONT'D) there was my brother, he was running towards me - screaming - laughing - he lifted me up -- 
 MARK (CONT'D) It's always been his sport. He let me inside. I'm just lucky to be very very good at it. 
 You won that match. Not him. 
 The U.S. Olympic Committee refuses to recognize that training for international competition is a full time job. Why is that? Why is that? (looks at Mark) I want you all to have a home. 
 (V.O.) I wish every American could come here and see for themselves. See the price of freedom. It's not free at all. 20. 
 The sacrifices of the troops that first long winter remind me of what you athletes go through. 
 (BEAT) I can't think of anyone I'd rather build a team with. (turns to Mark) You name your price. 
 You ready? 
 25 thousand a year. He said name your price and I said the highest price that came into my head. We'd get to hand-pick our own team, wrestlers we want to work with - 
 Who you gonna train with? 
 No - I mean... when I say we, I mean - you and me... could choose a team. Together. 
 What does du Pont get out of it? 
 As soon as you meet him you'll understand. He sees what we're after. He cares about America - old family, basically paid for the Revolutionary War - he gets it. He wants to help us win, help restore our pride. 
 My pride is fine. 22. 
 No, not.... This country's pride. 
 MARK (CONT'D) Dave - this is it. This is what we've wanted our whole lives - just to train - you and me - not to have to deal with USA Wrestling, or Harper and his corrupt university program - not to have to think about anybody else... 
 - What're you guys talking about? 
 I'm speaking to my brother, that okay with you? 
 Always good to see you, Mark. (as she walks away) Please, eat our food, shit on our lawn. Enjoy yourself... 
 Why does she... 
 MARK (CONT'D) The deer hunting on his farm's supposed to be amazing... 
 I got a good thing going here. I got a contract. Nancy's happy, Alex likes his school... 
 The Worlds are sixty days away. 23. 
 Tell me your plan. Who you gonna train with? 
 (LOST) Du Pont's taking his money out of the Villanova program. They'll pull the plug on that. So. Dan Bane could come. I - I guess Dan Bane. (beat, then, very quietly) I don't know how to do this without you. 
 Do what? 
 DAVE (CONT'D) It sounds like an opportunity. 
 Does it? 
 I think you could make something of it. 
 Do you? 
 (DAVE NODS) A spot's always open for you if you decide to come. 
 Thank you. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Congrats, little brother. 
 Hi. I'm Mark Schultz. 
 MARK (CONT'D) I'm here to see John du Pont? 
 Is Mr. du Pont expecting you? 
 Yeah. Well - not today exactly, but, yes. This week. Sometime. 
 Just a moment, please. 25. 
 In the meantime can I use the - 
 (opening the door) Please. 
 (CONFUSED) Is he? He's in there? 
 The washroom. 
 Mr. Beck will see you now. 
 Come in, sit down. 
 Thanks. 
 Thank you, Rosie. 
 You're welcome, Mr. Beck. 
 Okay. Okay. So. Mark Schultz, correct? 
 Yes. 
 (opens a folder, writing) S-C-H-U-L-T-Z? 
 That's right. 
 ... M-A-R-K? 
 Sounds okay. 
 Let's talk about what you're doing here. I'd like to make sure we all understand each other. Does that sound like a good policy to you? 
 That could be a good policy. 27. 
 Good. I think so, too. First thing I can tell you is that Mr. du Pont is very happy he can help you with your goals. But I want to make sure you're aware of what's expected. It's not a free ride. In exchange for the guest house, the more than substantial salary, the privilege of training at Foxcatcher Farms, Mr. du Pont expects results. Understood? 
 Yes. 
 I'm sure you can appreciate that. 
 Of course. 
 That goes for every wrestler. 
 I've actually got suggestions for about half the roster. 
 What about the other half? 
 
 (BEAT) I've been making phone calls. 
 I'll take a look at that when you've finished. All right. Now. 
 Twenty-seven. 
 Education? 28. 
 Oklahoma University. 
 Undergraduate? 
 Yes. 
 You graduated? 
 Yes. 
 Do you own any property? 
 No. 
 Are your parents still married? 
 
 (BEAT) No. 
 How old were you when they separated? 
 Two. 
 Have you ever been accused of a crime? 
 No. 
 MARK (CONT'D) Mr. du Pont. 
 Ah. Hello. You've arrived. 29. 
 Yes sir, I drove straight down. 
 Tonight's speech. All set. 
 They're setting him up in the chalet? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Excellent bed. Firm mattress. 
 (SILENCE) Good for the lower back. 
 Great. 
 All right. 
 All right. Thank you, sir. 
 Shall we finish this? 
 No. 
 Have you ever initiated a lawsuit? 
 (re the horses) They're Mrs. du Pont's. We all just keep our distance. 
 I didn't realize he was married. 
 Mr. du Pont? He's not. Mrs. du Pont's his mother. 
 Utilities are paid for - gas, electric. Refrigerator's stocked for now, but in the future you're responsible for feeding yourself. Unless of course you get invited to the Big House for dinner. 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) Someone will bring your car around. Anything else you need? 
 Has he always lived with his mother? 
 Mr. du Pont? I think so. 31. 
 Mr. du Pont, I want to thank you FOR - 
 You hear that? 
 You wrote this? 
 I did. 
 Thank you. Do you want to come in? 
 No no - 
 - The fridge is full - you probably know better than me what's in there- 
 - No. You need your rest. You need to get started bright and early. 
 Not even. 54 days. 
 54 days. 
 (BEAT) We'll get it done. 
 Drop! 
 MARK (CONT'D) 
 - 
 Hey, Coach. 
 Dan Bane. How's that hamstring? 
 Coming back. It's coming back. 
 Good. Good to hear. Hamstring coming back. 34. 
 (walking up to him) Sir, you need me for something? 
 No no. Later. Please. Continue. 
 (nods, turns back) Pair up. On the mat. Up and down. Popper, Springer, let's go. 
 Spling Loll - must lay off the pohk flied lice. 
 (EXHAUSTED) Suck me, Gecko. (as he comes onto the mat) And I'm fucking Filipino, dickhead. 
 Go! 
 (awkward, not loud enough) Good. 
 (CLAPS AGAIN) Good. 
 I can't get you anything at all? 
 No, thank you. I'm good. 
 In training. Excellent. 
 Gecko? Great wrestler. What do you want to know? 
 Just a sense. Keep your eye on him. Let me know of anything suspicious. Subversive. Anti. 
 Anti-what? 
 Anything at all. Phone calls. Anything. 
 (no idea what that means) I will. 
 You see the artistry, the care, the craftsmanship that went into making this great American symbol? You see the face hidden among the feathers? 
 (MARK LOOKS) Right here. 36. 
 (MARK NODS) How're we doing with Dave Schultz? 
 How do you mean? 
 You were going to speak to him again. When's he coming? 
 Right. Look. Dave's... he's got a good situation going up in Madison. He's... he doesn't want to uproot. The family. Just at the moment. 
 (BEAT) At the present time. 
 He is a world class competitor - a world class coach. We are building a world class team. He belongs here. Tell me what I have to offer him. 
 Mr. du Pont, I don't... you can't buy Dave. 
 MARK (CONT'D) I wasn't... I didn't realize you wanted him to coach. 
 Wrestle and coach. We all coach each other. Support each other. 
 Right to left. 
 I'll catch up with you all later. 
 I'm pretty sure that's John's mother. 
 One... twois... quatro! 
 ...Fireman's carry... to a half- nelson... to a chicken wing... Wait! A chicken wing? 
 Dave. 
 - a scrambled-egg!... a feather- pluck!... 
 Dave. 
 Hey, Mark -- 
 Come meet Mr. du Pont. 
 Hi. Dave Schultz. 
 John du Pont. It's a pleasure to meet you in person finally. 
 (TO DAVE) I told him how excited you were to meet him. 
 This is Alex, that's my wife, Nancy, our daughter Danielle. (TO NANCY) Hey, Nance. John du Pont. 
 Hey. 40. 
 Hello. 
 Come on in. Can I get you a drink - 
 No no. 
 You sure - ? 
 Thank you. No. I need to be getting back. But, don't worry - we'll make a Foxcatcher out of you yet. (he laughs awkwardly) Until tomorrow. 
 Well, I know what I need. 
 What? 
 Turkey drumstick! 
 Dave, check out the tape I have on 
 - 
 (STILL WRESTLING) 
 - 
 I want to show you this downblock - 
 Cue it up. 
 Too difficult to come say hello to Mr. du Pont? 41. 
 I said hello. (lights a CIGARETTE) I'm watching my kid. 
 It's John du Pont. One of the most generous men in America. He's gonna save USA Wrestling. (re. cigarette) Can you not do that in here? 
 Do what? 
 Smoking. 
 Smoke? 
 I wrestle tomorrow. 
 It's my room, Mark. You don't have to be here. 
 I'm trying to get advice from my brother, get ready for the finals - 
 Go get ready - 
 You start smoking - ? 
 You can leave. Go to your own room - 
 - Your kids are in here - 
 MARK (CONT'D) What the hell is that? 
 Mark. Calm down. 
 I'm not the one frigging smoking. 42. 
 The window's open. Relax. Show me what you want me to look at. 
 I think you're up. 
 I don't want to let you down. 43. 
 I can't.... I've watched you these past months... (long beat, then quietly) I can't imagine being let down by you. 
 "LET'S DANCE". 
 Let's clear it out! 
 You sure about this? 
 Mother's idea of sport is riding a horse that's chasing a dog that's chasing a fox. I don't share her affection for horseflesh - 
 (CHANTING TOGETHER) Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!... 45. 
 WRESTLERS (CONT'D) U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!... 
 You've brought honor to Team Foxcatcher. 
 You all right, Coach? 
 More drinks! 
 321 days to Seoul, gentlemen. 321 days. Let's get to work. 
 (O.S.) You don't have to do this. 
 America doesn't respect you. Doesn't place any value on you at all. I reward accomplishment. 
 Thank you, Coach. 
 Please. Call me John. Or Coach. Whichever you prefer. Maybe Eagle. Or Coach. Eagle is good. (THEN) How're we doing with Dave? 
 Yes. Yes, I did. I... 
 (BEAT) It's not gonna happen. He got offered a contract extension at Wisconsin, Team USA wants him to train Olympic wrestlers next summer, he - it's not gonna happen. 
 Do you believe in this team? 
 Of course I - 
 - Do you believe we deserve this country's best talent? 
 I do - 
 - I pay for results not only on the mat, but in recruiting the best of the best to Foxcatcher Farms. That's part of your job. 
 
 (TENTATIVE) Do you think that's true? Because... all these years - 
 - Well. You're the public face of Foxcatcher. 
 If that's what - 
 - What do you know about Masters League wrestling tournaments? 
 Uh - well - not all that much - 
 - Because I'm thinking of entering one. 
 Okay... 
 (O.C.) This is the one. 
 He wears the singlet - 
 - and the gold medal - 
 - and, of course, the gold medal. And a lot of oil. 
 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) A lot of oil. Please. More oil. It defines the musculature. 
 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) You're winning the gold medal. You're raising your arms in triumph. You're also feeling humility. 
 You good with this? 
 It's wonderful. It's exactly what I needed from you. 
 Good! Now. Mark. You're winning the gold medal! And you are humbled! 
 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Good! And again! 
 I think you were below me by a couple of steps when you hugged me at the Worlds. 
 It's true. 
 Maybe if you kneeled. 
 Kneeled now? On the floor. 
 (UNSURE) Really? It won't look... 
 No. No. You should kneel. 
 Brandon and I prepared some remarks. 51. 
 (MARK NODS) Good. Try the speech. 
 Read it? 
 Read the speech. 
 
 (READING) John Eagle du Pont, highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil... phila... 
 Philatelist. 
 (O.C.) That's the one! That's the one I need! 
 In that case, the Grand Old Party wants to help find you one. 
 STEVE (CONT'D) General, any of these models available? 
 What I need is the gun turret. Don't send me one without that MK- 19 mounted on top. 
 General, John du Pont is hardly your usual civilian. 
 ... highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil... phila... 
 Philatelist. 
-- (GIVING UP) Stamp collector. 
 Stamp collector, and former pentathlete. 
 MARK (CONT'D) Mr. Du Pont will be making his return to competitive sports in the over-50 category at the Masters' League du Pont Wrestling Invitational in Phoenix, Arizona this March. 
 MARK (CONT'D) I'm so proud to introduce my mentor. He has the ability to look at me and see where I am in life. He knows how to motivate me. I feel his love for me as an athlete and as a human being. My mother and father were divorced when I was two years old. I spent a lifetime looking for a father... (MORE) 54. 
 MARK (CONT'D) and I found one in the Golden, uh... the Gold Eagle of America - John du Pont. 
 Mark Schultz. Thank you, son. (waves to Jean in 
) Hello, Mother. (to them all) The gold medal Mark won in 1984 was tarnished. Tarnished by Jimmy Carter. Tarnished by the unpatriotic acts of that democrat administration. He caused the entire Eastern bloc to boycott our Los Angeles Games. Mark will have an opportunity to shine up that medal at the World Championships in just a few short weeks. To prove his worth in front of the assembled nations of the globe... 
 Ready? Go. 
 MARK (CONT'D) Okay. Let's try it again. 
 (to du Pont) Just a sec... 
 (BEAT) Okay. Call me soon. 56. 
 Looking good. 
 (NO REPLY) Looking tough. 
 MARK (CONT'D) I think you're ready. 
 (BEAT) We just need some more talc. 
 MARK (CONT'D) Yah! I think you're ready. 
 I appreciate this... 
 You've done the training, you learned the moves. You're ready to rumble, boss. 57. 
 No. Mark. I appreciate this. 
 (after a moment) It's nothing. 
 When I was fourteen - my father had left us long before that - my best friend was Clifford Holt, our gardener's son. Then I found out Mother had been paying Cliff to be friends with me. 
 We all have demons. 
 (TOTALLY SINCERE) It's good to know you and I have come to this... friendship without any of that nonsense. Financial nonsense. 
 When Dave's son, Alex, was born he had some problems with his lungs. It looked like he wasn't gonna live. I was sitting in the hospital waiting room, and all I could think was: Maybe it's better if he dies. Dave won't be distracted. We can get back to training together. 
 (BEAT) Alex is fine now and, you know, he's my nephew. I'm not proud I wanted him to die, but it's the truth. That's just the truth. (THEN) You gotta conquer your demons. 
 Conquer demons. 
 (over the gunfire) Yeahhhhh!!!! 
 They're dead. 
 When he gives you the slightest opening, you gotta shoot in on him. Be aggressive. Show him who's boss. 
 (V.O.) I've rearranged some of the horse ribbons, Mother... 
 ... Some of the older prizes in the trophy case. (MORE) 60. 
 Which ribbons? 
 I'm sorry? 
 Which ribbons did you move? 
 Just some of the older ones. From the case. From the Rosemont case. 
 I'll have a look later to see exactly what you've done. 
 (COMPLETELY GENUINE) Hi, Boss. How you doing? Any soreness from the match? 
 I went by the gym - it's almost noon - and there's no one in there. There is no one in there. In the gym. 
 Yeah, no, exactly - we've got an intense workout scheduled this afternoon. Real intense one. So we're taking the morning to rest up. 
 Who precisely is in charge around here? 
 Well, I mean, I am. 
 Where do we stand on Dave? 
 
 (BEAT) On what? 
 David Schultz. Your brother. When is he coming to Foxcatcher? 62. 
 John, seriously, I don't know how else to say it. It's not gonna happen. You can't buy Dave. It's just not gonna happen. 
 You got bitch-slapped. 
 GARCIA (CONT'D) Oh shit. 
 Hello?... Hello? 
 Mark. How are things? 
 I need to see John. 
 Mr. du Pont's not available right now. 
 Stan, please. I need to see him. 
 He's got a very full schedule this afternoon. But I'll let him know you stopped by. 
 (more and more upset) Listen - I - something happened. There was a - misunderstanding. I think I did something wrong and I really need to talk to him about it- 
 - Mark, I hear you. But Mr. du Pont's away for the afternoon on business. He's simply not here. 
 New moves. Wrestling moves. Need to try them out. 
 Oh, uh - 
 In the gym. 
 Yeah, of course. Just... just give me a minute. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Dave. 
 How you doing? 
 Good. I'm good. 
 I hadn't seen you yet. I just want to make sure everything's okay. 66. 
 Yeah. I'm just concentrating. Trials are in 50 days. 
 You know, Nancy and the kids are here. 
 How they doing? 
 Good. You should stop in, say hi. 
 I will. 
 (BEAT) I will. 
 There's this big match between an American and a Russian. The Russian is a monster, never lost, kills everybody with this hold called The Pretzel. So the American coach tells his wrestler, "Listen, whatever you do don't let this guy get you in The Pretzel or you're dead." Sure enough, match starts, the Russian gets him in The Pretzel. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) The coach buries his head in his hands because he know's it's all over. Suddenly, he hears the crowd roar. When he looks up the Russian is flying through the air - he lands on his back, the American jumps him. Pins him. Boom. The match is over. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) "Nobody's ever gotten out of The Pretzel," the coach says afterward, "How'd you do it?" "Well, Coach, I was just about to give up when I opened my eyes and there was this big hairy pair of balls right in front of my face. I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I craned my neck and bit those babies as hard as I could." 
 (SOME LAUGHS) The coach says, "And that did the trick?" (LOW) (MORE) 68. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) "Coach, you'd be surprised how motivated you get when you bite your own balls." 
 He gives you opportunity, jump on it. Hard. Drive him down. 
 No mercy! 
 (to the wrestlers) Okay. Okay. You heard the Head Coach. No mercy. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) (to du Pont) Would you give us a little room? Just stand over there for a sec... (turns to Springer) 
 - 
 DAVE (CONT'D) - when he grabs for your elbow, goes for head position - your hand on his wrist needs to come up immediately, suck his arm to your chest, right hook over the top for the headlock, take him down, drive him down - 
 DAVE (CONT'D) - you see him commit you make him 
 - 
 Keep it up, gentlemen. 
 Your brother's taking the reins. Leading. 
 (QUIET) Please don't do that. 70. 
 Conquer your demons, Mark. 
 - 
 (QUIET) - Please. I'm asking you to not... 
 Why'd you take off so suddenly? 
 (STILL WATCHING) Need to study up. Fix some weakness. 
 You been doing this since you left? 
 Pretty much. 
 What's going on with you and John? 
 (STILL WATCHING) Nothing's going on. 
 (BEAT) What does that mean? 71. 
 You seemed kind of upset in the gym. 
 (STILL WATCHING) The fuck you talking about? 
 He was talking to you about something and you seemed pretty upset. (THEN) What was he saying to you? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Okay. You want me to leave you alone, I'll leave you alone. You decide you want to talk, you know where to find me. 
 David Schultz. Dave. 
 Hey, Coach. 
 I'd like to show you something. Why don't you hop in? 
 WELL - 
 - Need to show you something. At the battlefield. Come. Sit. Come. 
 You know what, Coach? It's Sunday. Family time. 
 Good morning, John. 
 Family time. Ah. Very good. 
 And.... break! Gentlemen, well done! Listen up. Team. Listen up. 
 (mutters under his breath) My fucking name's Roberto, dickweed. 74. 
 Muchas gracias, compadre. (gestures to the mat) Por favor. 
 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.) That's the second - and final - loss for David Schultz. 
 Get after him, Mark! Shoot low!... 
 Need to get after him, there. Low low low. 
 He's open to the left. He leaves his entire left side open. You gotta get after that fucker! Make him pay. Now or never... 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Double elimination, buddy. You'll get it back. 
 Next time, Mark. A good effort. 76. 
 Open up - I know you're in there. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Mark. I'm gonna kick it in if you don't open it. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Mark! 
 DAVE (CONT'D) What's going on with you? You got a match in four hours. 
 (BEAT) What happened to your face? 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Jesus Christ, tell me you didn't eat all this. 
 (NO ANSWER) You got to weigh in before every match. 
 I'm done. 
 What does that mean? 
 It's over. I'm done. You lost. I lost. It's over. 
 Look at me. Look at me. You have a chance to do what no wrestler's done since 1904. Not one. If you think I'm gonna let you throw away a chance to win back-to-back Olympic golds you're fucking crazy. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Do you know what I'd give to have the extra years you've got? To have one more shot? To not have to start coaching full time? Do you?! (hits him again) I'm done, Mark. I've lost a step. You haven't. I will kick the shit out of you. I will lift you up and personally throw you out on that mat to take what's yours - what we've been training for since high school. And I will be on your ass every day from here to South Korea. 78. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) (QUIET NOW) I'm with you, Mark. You're not in this alone. 
 (under his breath) Shit. 
 87 kilos. 
 How long does he have to make weight? 
 Weigh-in period ends at 3:30pm. 
 C'mon, fat boy, you got 90 minutes to cut 12 pounds. 
 Here you are. I've been looking all over for you -- 
 Wait! Wait! We're here... (TO MARK) Get 'em off. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Come here. 
 82 kilos. 80. 
 Mark. Drink. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Mark... 
 
! 
 Hey, Stan. 81. 
 Dave. What can I do for you? 
 I'm having some trouble finding John. He's not in his room - 
 - Right. 
 - I wanted to check in with him. I had a kind of uncomfortable thing with John before the match this afternoon - Mark was in a really delicate place, and I had to ask John to not be in his corner. I just wanted to make sure he's okay with everything. And that he's happy with the result. With how things turned out. 
 Dave. Mr. du Pont's mother died this morning. He flew home to Philadelphia earlier today. 
 Can I help you? 
 (leaning across Nancy) What's going on? 
 How can I help you? 
 We live here. We're part of Team Foxcatcher. 83. 
 Your names? 
 What's going on? 
 New security plan. Names? 
 Dave and Nancy Schultz. Mark Schultz. 
 Can I see some picture ID's? 
 Are you serious? 
 Please. 
 (TO GUARD) - this guy just made the Olympic team. 
. 
 This is for you, sir. 
 Tomorrow morning? 84. 
 
 - 
 7 O'CLOCK - 
 Yeah. 
 I'll pick you up tomorrow, 7am. 
 You got it. 
 Wait - your house, right? 
 Congrats, my brother. 
 What you got, baby? 
 John wrote me a check for ten thousand dollars. 
 No no. All's fine. There's work to be done. 
 (CLAPS) Back to work, gentlemen. 
 Mark. Focus. Look at me. (Mark looks at him) Focus on me. 
 (MARK NODS) You here? 
 (MARK NODS) Let's run it again. 
 - 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Get your head on straight and do this. 
 If you and I can't get him there, no one can. We're in this together. 
: 
 (V.O.) Our challenge... as coaches... as leaders. I have coached... and psychologically prepare... Our Mark Schultz. To capture Olympic Gold... 
 ...I wear many hats. I am leader. Mentor. Father figure. Brother. Older brother. At times the younger... 
 It will not be easy. We have built... our family. Our obligation... is to build... winners... In life. To teach the secret... To build men who will... think of... Who will understand... the character traits... We must teach them... whether they will listen or no. 87. 
 We're so very sorry about your mother's passing. 
 Yes. Very sad. Very sad days here. Here at the farm. 
 Well, whatever we can do. 
 What we wanted to discuss... Mr. Du Pont spends a significant amount of money for wrestlers' training here at Foxcatcher. Now - in addition - he'd like to make a sizable direct donation to USA Wrestling. (THEN) This money would come with conditions. (MORE) 88. 
 May I ask what sort of a donation we're discussing? 
 Four hundred thousand dollars. 
 (under his breath) And gym bags. 
 And gym bags. 
 (GASPING) What's going on? 
 What -? 
 We believe that Eagle has earned the right to be named to the official roster of Olympic coaches at Seoul. Which means he would be in Mark Schultz's corner throughout the games. 
 We'll all, of course, just need to get him to sign off on this. 
 You can take care of that? 
 I can try. 
 You're late. 
 Were you in the Big House yesterday? 90. 
 For a little while. 
 In the afternoon? Because I got turned away when I came within fifty yards of the house. (THEN) What were you doing there? 
 I'm a coach here. I get paid by John. I was meeting with John. 
 About what? 
 Mark. Get dressed. 
 He's weakening me. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I talked to Bachman at SMU last night. He says they're expanding the program. There'll be room for both of us in the fall - 
 - Mark - 
 - I told him we could all get on the phone next weekend - 
 - You need to focus on what's happening a month from now. Not - 
 - SMU's gonna make a move, they're gonna take a run at it - we can be there at the beginning - 
 - Don't do this. Don't do it. Stay clear about what we're working for. 91. 
 - I can't do this anymore. I can't do it - 
 - It's not the time, Mark - 
 - John's killing me here - 
 - He's not killing you - 
 - If we at least let Bachman know by the end of the week we'll have a place to go to after - 
 - Stop. Stop it! 
 DAVE (CONT'D) I will make sure you're taken care of after Seoul. I'll talk to John - whatever you decide: you want to stay, you want to go - I'll make sure you're taken care of. 
 You're not thinking of staying here...? 
 I don't know, Mark. The schools are great, the kids are happy. They have eight hundred acres to run around in... 
 DAVE (CONT'D) If you win next month you're in a class by yourself, you write your own ticket. You live your own life however you want. Focus on that. 92. 
 (QUIETLY) My own life. 
 That's right. 
 And you'll be here. 
 I'll be here. Whenever you need me. 
 What's on your forehead? 
 What? 
 It says kids. 
 To remind me to pick up the kids from school. 
 What does that mean? When are you gonna you see your own forehead? 
 I don't have to. You just told me. 
 Where's the grenade launcher? 
 The 40mm grenade launcher that's supposed to be mounted up here. 
 - It goes right here. Right here. 
 So where is it? 
 My name's Dave Schultz. I'm Coach and head of recruiting here at Foxcatcher, under Head Coach John "Eagle" du Pont - 
 (V.O.) - Coach du Pont, uh, understands excellence, he represents... excellence, he expects it from his 
 - 
 (halting; trying so hard) - His... commitment to this sport is complete. He's made himself um, an... an expert in the sport of wrestling... 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Eagle is indispensable to - uh - what it... to - what we're trying to accomplish here. (looks down, UNCOMFORTABLE) We... consider John... (QUIETLY) one of us. (MORE) 95. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) (SO QUIETLY) One of us. 
 I'll commit to remaining at Foxcatcher so long as John wants me here, but only if my brother is taken care of. 
 Taken care of how? 
 So long as I'm here, Mark will continue to be paid. 
 Paid what? 
 His full salary. 
 You want him paid even if he leaves? What if he quits? 
 Whether or not he chooses to stay. That's right. 96. 
 You're making quite an assumption about the value of your presence here. 
 You're welcome to test the theory. 
 What does that mean? 
 We can see how many wrestlers stay if I decide to go. 
 (BEAT) I hope it doesn't come to that. 
 (BEAT) I'd also ask John to understand the delicate nature of the lead-up to Seoul, and please allow Mark some space. Let him train just with me. 
 (TO MARK) You're that determined to leave? 
 He'd like the option. 
 First of all, Mark has always been free to train in whatever - 
 - That's not exactly how it's - 
 - Just a minute - you've had your say. 
 Sorry. 97. 
 - To train in whatever way is most effective for him. Eagle offers his advice and counsel. If Mark chooses to ignore it, that's his loss. (THEN) Mr. du Pont would be prepared to accept your financial terms, but only if we get an answer to what we proposed weeks ago. 
 What's that? 
 That John du Pont, Head Coach of Team Foxcatcher, be seated in Mark's corner throughout the Olympic Games. 
 You've talked about this? 
 I was waiting for the right moment to bring it up with you. You haven't exactly been in a receptive frame of mind. 
 All right, then. I guess we're done. 
 This is your moment to prove yourself - your moment to step out alone, away from everyone, into the spotlight. This has nothing to do with me, nothing to do with John - 
 DAVE (CONT'D) - nothing to do with anyone but you. This is you, Mark. This is you. Focus and take what's yours! 
 From the United States of America, at 82 kilos... Mark Schultz. 
 Wrestle! 
 I/E. DRIVING - DAY 
 Name? 
 (V.O.) ... He's coached national and world champions with his unique blend of passion and inspiration... 
: 
 From the under hook, pivot sideways while pulling down on his arm. Kneel between his legs and take him to the mat. 
 He's made himself an - an expert in the art and sport of wrestling... 
 DAVE (CONT'D) Eagle is indispensable to - uh - what it... what we're trying to accomplish here. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) We... consider John... one of us. (QUIETLY) One of us. 
 Our challenge... as coaches... as leaders. I have coached... and psychologically prepare... our Mark Schultz... to capture Olympic Gold. I wear many hats. I am leader. Mentor. Father figure. Brother. 
 (V.O.) The symbol of America is the Golden Eagle... 102. 
 (V.O.) John du Pont is that Golden Eagle. 
 We've bought several time slots next week on local station WPHI - 
 (STILL MOVING) Good. 
 - Several late night slots, of course, but there was also an open afternoon half-hour, directly after "The Edge of Night." That should be a good one - 
 Excellent. 
 - I'll let you know what the viewership numbers are as soon as I have them. 
 Northern Cardinal. Look at that. 
 They never leave home, no matter how cold it gets. 
 Hey, Coach. 
 DAVE (CONT'D) What's up, John? 
 You got a problem with me?

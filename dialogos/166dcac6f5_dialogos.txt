 
 
 I don't see her. 
 The shift change is late.   Just wait. 
 Are you sure about this? 
 We've been doing this forever. Trust me. This lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it. 
 I'm cute. 
 Is um... is that her? 
 Shit. 
 Dude. 
 It's cool, it's cool. (to Parker) Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him- 
 -What?   Me? No way.    This is your thing. 
 
 -GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends". 
 -you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets. 
 Dan, no.   You do it.    I feel stupid. 
 You've got this.    You can totally do this. 
 Parker, you've so got this. 
 The worst thing that happens is he says no. He won't say no. No one ever says no. 
 Why me? 
 `Cause you're a girl. 
 A very beautiful girl with a very charming smile. (then) 
 My charming smile? 
 Hey. 
 Jason. 
 Oh, cool.    My brother's name is Jason. 
 OK. 
 Yeah, so I don't want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything...but..this is gonna sound so stupid... 
 Right. 
 No- but I mean, we totally have some cash and stuff. We just don't have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you know? 
 How much? 
 Like...fifty? 
 I could lose my job. 
 He's not going for it. 
 Will you shut up? He's gonna go for it. It's either stand there and do the job for minimal... minimal, what is it? 
 Minimum. 
 -Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more. 
 She had to come skiing with us? 
 You said you didn't mind? 
 I don't.   I don't mind.   Don't mind at all. 
 
 For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes. 
 Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you... 
 No, no it's fine. I'm just saying, the Mount Holliston day trips were our thing, you know? She doesn't even know how to board yet. 
 She's getting better. (then) Now I feel like a dick. You should have said something if it was a problem. 
 It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything. 
 Good work!     See?   They always go for it. 
 I did good, right? 
 You did great. 
 Oh, so where's my change? 
 There isn't any. 
 You gave him the full hundred? 
 He wasn't going for it at 50. 
 
 
 I would have asked for change. 
 It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right? 
 I would have definitely asked him for change. 8. 
 (scoffs at Parker) "Girlfriends"? 
 Look at that. See? All these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski. Not us. All thanks to you, baby. 
 (teasing) Oh, now I'm "baby"?     You never call me pet names. 
 I'm just not a `pet name' guy. 
 (to Lynch) He calls me "Parker." 
 It's your name. 
 Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? Like "honey" or "sweetie". 
 I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. "Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here. 
 See? At least I don't call you "O'Neil". 
 You don't touch my face enough either. 
 (to no one imparticular) 
 
 Hey, that's not fair. I'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck. 
 Wha-? I never said that. I never said you make my life suck. (then, forced) Sweetie. 
 
 (to Parker) Dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board? 
 I wouldn't say that. But last time we went I did pretty good, right? 
 You did awesome. I'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike. (MORE) 10.(cont'd) (to Lynch's skis) Are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board? 
 Please. Snowboards are too EMO for me. Give it ten more years and that fad will be dead. 
 That's what they said about rap. 
 Mmm-mmm. Smell that fresh mountain air, huh? Kind of smells like... cancer. 
 You know what, I am so sick of potheads giving me shit about smoking butts. 
 At least pot does something for you. Cigarettes are just gross. Especially out in the cold. It like sticks to you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old man's used floss. 
 Used floss? Where do you come up with this shit. 
 
 No, I have never- why would I ever sniff my floss? Why am I friends with you? 
 What time do you think we'll get back? I have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight. 
 Oh no. She broke the rule. 
 
 No worrying about the bullshit of real life. The whole point of this 
 But, I haven't read a- 
 It's alright. 
 Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of heights? 
 No. 
 So it doesn't bother you when I do this? 
 Quit it! 
 Baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off 
 Points for calling me "baby" but you just made that statistic up. 
 Yeah, statistics don't work on smokers. 
 
 OK, WHAT ASSHOLE COULDN'T GET ON THE CHAIR RIGHT? 
! 
 Actually, I paid good money. 
 Yeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing. 
! 
 Why do I have to wear a helmet? 
 Safety first. 
 But you guys don't wear them. 
 
 
 DAN / LYNCH Awww. 
 You're just doing this to make fun of me. 
 No, I'm not. I swear.    You look hot in a helmet. 
 Need some help? 
 (laughing) Do you think? 
 Aww, check out Lynch. 
 
 What the hell? 
 Woah! Shit, man!    I was just trying to help! 
 Ryan, what the hell? 
 He had his hands all over you! 15. 
 No he didn't. I can take care of myself! 
 I was seriously just trying to help. I mean, how could I even 
 (laughs) 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Well, thank you for your help.    I am so, so sorry about that. 
 Joe. 
 (calling to her) Shan! 
 Well it was nice to meet you. 
 (to his friends) I was like one second away from beating that guy's ass. 16. 
 I know you were, man.   Come on. Don't sweat it. 
 Seriously, that guy was such a dick. 
 Come on boys. We can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom. 
 I'm tough. 
 I know you are. 
 
 Are you kidding? We are totally doing this every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I'd say we should cut class, too. 
 Last one to the bottom is buying dinner! 
 We gotta take a weekend trip up 
 
 Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like 
 Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill 
 Dude, you didn't have to stay with us. It's totally cool if you want to go off for a few. 
 No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point. 18. 
 You know, I've probably had enough for today anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go- 
 -no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that. 
 I told you I didn't have to come. 
 Parker, I didn't not want you to come. 
 It was his idea that we invited you in the first place. 
 Exactly. Remember? I was like "Hey man, why doesn't Parker come 
 -I was like, "OK that would be cool". 
 It's OK, you guys. The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on "guy time". I won't be offended. I've got stuff I could do anyway. (to Dan) Actually, can I have the key? I should check my messages. 19. 
 No. No locker key. I can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell. 
 She does not. 
 Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom 
 What did you say?   You said chicken. 
 
 I'm sorry if I ruined skiing for you today. 20. 
 You didn't! You didn't at all! You missed the part before you walked over here when I was all like, "Dude, this has been so cool...you know...doing..." 
 (O.C.) Joe! 
 (to his friends) Wait up. 
 Hey. I just wanted to apologize again. 
 Oh, no big deal. He's just lucky he didn't make me mad. You know, I just look half your boyfriend's size. 
 Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend. We're, you know, trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see, that's not really gonna work. 
 (teasing) No way. 21. 
 A group of us all agreed to go skiing this weekend and well, whatever. It's a whole story and- 
 Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes. 
 Cool. Well, my roommate and I come like every Sunday, so maybe I'll see you. 
 
 OK.   See ya later. 
 Actually, you know what? Would it be cool if I got your number or 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Shit. Don't ski with my phone. It's in the locker with everyone else's stuff. Do you have a pen? 
 Don't ski with a pen.     Sorry. 22. 
 Just shoot then. I've got a really good memory. I've only smoked pot like 500 times so I'm good. 
 You know it's a gateway drug right? 
 Whew.   You! That's so like you! 
 But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs! 
 It's not my decision, man.    They're closing early. 
 
 Why don't you write a letter? 
 (to Dan) Remember "429". 
 What? 23. 
 Just remember "429". (to himself) "5022". "5022." "5022." 
 (to Jason) 
 Sorry. 
 Honestly, I'd slide you some more money but we gave you everything we have. 
 (to Jason) Hey man, do you have a pen? 
 It's not about the money. They need to clear the mountain. We've got weather coming in. There's nothing I can do. 
 What if we promise to run straight 
 Wicked fast. 
 Fine. But hurry. 
 DAN                              PARKER Thank you!                           Thank you so much! 
 We'll be wicked fast.    Like the wind! 
 Seriously. For a hundred bucks 
 I know right? They're supposed to 
 Wachusett still has night skiing. 
 "429". 
 Good for you, Lynch.   You got her number! 
 What did He-Man have to say about that? 
 
 Nope. 
 Early night, huh? 
 You're not gonna hear me complain. 
 Pendergraft wants you to stop by the office.   Something about next weekend's schedule. 
 I'm not working next weekend. 
 Go talk to the boss. He's getting ready to leave. 
 I'm the best man! (under his breath) Shit. 
 Ready to shut down? 
 There's three more on their way down. Wait for them, then it's all set. 
 I'm not waiting til we get back to campus to eat. I'm starving. 26. 
 Why didn't you have some pizza? 
 You mean the cardboard with tomato sauce that you guys ate? That wasn't pizza. That was like, 
 There's a Papa Gino's on our way 
 Sweet. I am gonna eat a whole real 
 Check it out! 
 
 Jesus! 
 It's just wind, Parker. 
 Don't you mean, "baby"? 
 (to Lynch) Who invited you? 27. 
 
 Shit.   Do you hear that? 
 It's the mountains.    It snows every night. Relax. 
 Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole pizza. (a few beats) I'm not even kidding. 28. 
 (O.S.) 
 Cool. Last three just hit.   I'm 
 (O.C.) Clear up here. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Bur! 29. 
 (yelling to the sky) IT'S FRIGGIN COLD UP HERE!   NO TIME FOR THIS CRAP! THANK YOU! 
 It's gonna start again, right? 
 (quickly) 
 
 "Get off me, you're crushing my 
 I told you that? 
 What do you think the worst way to die would be? 30. 
 That's not morbid. 
 Yeah, seriously.    That's kinda spooky, Dan. 
 I think getting eaten by a shark would be the worst way to go. (beat) Not if it was like one of those 
 The chick on the Jaws poster was 
 She was? 
 I don't know. She was naked. Naked chicks are hot. 
 But if you actually like saw the fin coming for you in the water. That would be worse than actually 
 That's why I only swim in pools. 
 I think burning to death would be the worst. 31. 
 Well yes and no. Because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them. 
 I remember watching TV for like 3 
 But they say that when you jump 
 OK, then Lynch. What is the worst 
 (defensive) What? 
 No, you have an answer for 
 Easy.   The Sarlaac pit. 
 The what? 
 The Sarlaac pit. From Return of the Jedi? Hel-lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? Worst. Death. Ever. 
 (teasing) "I don't know why I never have a girlfriend, you guys!" 32. 
 Shut-up. 
 
 Give it a minute. 
 This is nothing man. At Stowe last year, me and Solet were stranded for like 25 minutes. This big chick fell getting off up top and 
 (yelling) WHAT THE FUCK??!    HELLO???!!!! 
 Come on now! This is messed up. 
 HEY! TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON! 
!!!! 
 Are they fucking kidding? 
 I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I'm not gonna lie. 
 HE-LLO!!!!!!!!!!!???? 
 (quietly) No one knows we're up here.    They forgot that we're up here. 
 No they didn't. They couldn't have. I'm sure they have a system or something. There's probably security cameras on us right now. 
 What if they don't start it again? 
 (angered out of panic) Will you stop?! 
 What did you say to the guy? 
 Me?   Nothing! 
 Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this. 34. 
 I didn't do anything!   He knows we're still up here. 
 Then why are the lights off, Dan? Is that part of their policy? Shut 
 They just lost power or something. 
 This is so messed up. 
 It's a power outage. They'll come up with a ladder if they have to. 
 
 Well you being all psycho about it isn't gonna make it move. Just chill out. 
 Don't yell at me. 
 I wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night? 35. 
 Free lift tickets. 
 What other people on the lift? There was no one in front of us. 
 We won't be stuck here all night. 
 No. You're right. We won't be here all night. It's Sunday. (she starts crying) Its fucking Sunday and they aren't 
 We're not going to be stuck here. Parker. Parker, look at me. Even 
 It's true. I've done it before. You just get tired of waiting, you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you just jump. It's actually kind of fun, but they can ban you from the mountain for it. 
 (hysterical) -HELP!!! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US!!!! HEL-LO!!! HELP!!!!! 
 Shh. I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. But any minute now they're gonna turn the power back on and we're all gonna be laughing about this. 
 
 That makes two of us. 
 
 Well, what do you want me to do?   I gotta go. 
 
 
 Are you crazy! Put the bar down!!! 
 It's just the safety bar. It doesn't really do anything anyway. 
 Well I like the safety bar and I like it down where it's supposed to be. 37. 
 Then how are you going to piss? 
 I can hold it. 
 
 I can hold it. 
 
 I'm pissing. 
 I hope they catch you and throw you out. I hope they ban you from the 
 Ban me from the mountain? You couldn't pay me to come back here. Make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn Fisher Price lift working? Sorry. Not coming back. 
 SOMEBODY GET US DOWN FROM HERE! 
! 
 (quietly) Put the safety bar down, Joe. 
 SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US! 
 (louder) Put the bar down. 
 
- 
 PUT THE BAR DOWN! 
 What did I tell you guys, huh?   WOO- HOO! UP HERE! 
 Oh, thank God. 
 UP HERE! 
 
! 
 Why isn't he stopping? 
 HEY!   WHAT THE HELL?!! 
 (O.C.) Steve. 
 Go for Steve. 41. 
 (O.S.) We got a problem here. 
 (O.C.) 
 That's gonna take me 20 minutes! 
 (O.C.) Sorry brother, but it's a frozen swimming pool down here. 
 
 What is this asshole doing? 
 No!   No! 
 
!!!!!! 
 My face is burning. 
 The power is coming back on soon. 
 No it isn't. 
 It has to. 
 Me neither. I use my phone. Hold on, let me just run back to the 
 Stop. 44. 
 Crunch Berries... 
 Please, stop. 
 
 Dude, quit it. 
 ...and I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Lucky Charms pre-purple horseshoes. 
 Everyone went home.    They left us up here. 
 Top 3 celebrities you'd do. (then) Me first again? Fine... 
 Someone has to jump. 
 SOMEBODY HELP US!! 
 (aside to Dan) 
 (aside to Parker) You're not gonna die, baby. I 
 
 (aside to Parker) It's alright. It's alright. 
 Great. (then) Best Christmas present you ever got? Go. 
 Shayna.   My puppy. 
 Disneyworld in 8th grade. 46. 
 Hmm...guess that leaves me. I'm gonna go with...oh yeah...these skis! Get it? MY SKIS. How ironic, huh? 
 Shit! 
 
 Shut-up. 
 I'm jumping. I'm gonna get help. 
 Dan...woah. Let's talk about this. 
 No.    No, don't leave me up here. 
 Parker, I can do this. Even if I get hurt, as long as I can get to the bottom I....your skin is so red. You're getting frost bite. 47. 
 You can't get frost bite that fast. It's only been- what, like...how long has it been? A few hours, tops? 
 (quietly) 
 I'll get help. Lynch is here. He'll be with you. 
 Dan, it's a far drop.     I don't know. 
 (heated) Do you have a better idea? I'm telling you, I've totally jumped off of a lift before. 
 
 
 No, no, no. Please don't jump down there, Dan. You'll get hurt. 48. 
 How are you going to find your way in the dark? 
 I'll stick to the trail. I'll ride to the bottom. 
 Walker, no. 
 One. 
 AHHH!!     OH MY GOD!   AHHHH!!!! 
 DAN!   DANNY? Oh my god! 
 Dan, say something.     Are you alright? 
 (O.C.) My legs.    I broke my fucking legs. 
 Oh, shit. 50. 
 Can you move? Dan? (she starts to panic) Hold on. Hold on, baby. 
 What are you doing? 
 I gotta...I have to get to him. 
 You'll just get hurt, too.   Stop. Calm down. 
 Calm down?! (to Dan) Talk to me, Danny! 
 Stay there. Don't get off the 
 (O.C.) How bad is it? 
 It's bad. It's really fucking bad. (starting to cry) SOMEONE HELP US! PLEASE! 
 OK. Alright. You gotta stay 
 
 (to Dan below) Buddy, can you move at all? 
 I can't even stand up. 
 You can't, like...I don't know, slide down the hill or something? 
 My legs are shattered, asshole! I'm bleeding to death- NO, I CAN'T SLIDE DOWN THE FUCKING MOUNTAIN! 
 (O.C.) Alright, alright. Um...? 52. 
 ...so much blood. 
 (to Dan below) Can you stop the bleeding? 
 (O.C.) With what? 
 Here... 
! 
 Here you go, Dan.     I'm throwing mine down. 
 (O.C.) I can't see. 
 
 What do I do with this? 53. 
 (O.C.) Tie it over your leg. Tie it off above wherever it's bleeding. Like a tourniquet thing. 
 I'm so cold. 
 Here, take my coat. 
 (O.C.) No! Don't you take off your coat! 
 No, I'll be OK. I can huddle next to Lynch. Please- 
 -Parker, keep your coat on. 
 (O.C.) Dan, buddy. You gotta let us throw something down so you can stop the bleeding. 54. 
 I...I've got it. 
 Are you sure. 
 Yup. 
 (O.C.) Are you sure you can't try and get 
 
 Alright.   Hold on. 
 You think you can pull yourself across that many chairs? 
 I can't even do a pull-up. 55. 
 (O.C.) You never even tried to do a pull up you asshole. You had your Mom write you a note to get out of climbing the rope in gym cause you're a pussy. 
 There was no reason to embarrass myself. I knew I couldn't do it. 
 (O.C.) 
 Even if I made it across to the 
 (O.C.) Every lift pole has an emergency 
 OK. The chair that's two back. Does it look like it's near the pole? 
 I don't know. I can't see. 
 Shit, that's far. 
 What if you fall, too? 56. 
 Parker...if we just sit here, we're gonna freeze to death. 
 Maybe...maybe in the morning someone else will come up here. 
 (O.C.) 
 We're right here, baby. 
 Yeah, man. We didn't go anywhere. I think...I think I'm gonna try and climb back to the pole. If the chair is close enough, maybe... 
 Do it.   Please do it now. 
 Just hang in there, Dan.     It's gonna be OK. 
 It's funny. But I was never afraid of heights, until like...right now. 
 What can I do to help? 
 Just hold on to my legs. You can't really stop me from falling...but it's, you know...psychological or something you know? 
 I think we should wait til morning. We can make it a few more hours. 
 (quietly) Us? Maybe. (then) But not him. 
 Baby, is that you? 
 (O.C.) What? 
 Shh! 
 Oh, motherfucker. 
 It's alright man. It's just a 
 (O.C.) 
 Just relax. When's the last time you heard of a wolf attack in New England? 
 I read about one on-line somewhere last year. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. 
 Wolves around here are pussies. They aren't even that big. 
 It could be worse, right? 
 (O.C.) How the hell...could this be worse? 
 It could be the Sarlacc Pit. 
 Parker- coming through with the 
 
 Nothing.   Just be quiet. 
 (O.C.) You can do this, Lynch.     You've got it. 
 Please stop talking. 
 (O.C.) Hold on, down there. I think once I can stand on the back- I should 
 (quietly at first) You guys. 
 What?   What's wrong? 
 (O.C.) There's a wolf down here. 61. 
 (gasps) Oh shit! 
 
 (O.C.) (screaming) GET AWAY FROM HIM!!! 
 Are you alright man? 
 (O.C.) 
 See? What did I tell you? They're more scared of you than you are of them. 
 (O.C.) I don't know. I'm pretty scared, I gotta be honest. 
 It's just a dog. That's all it is. 
 Are you keeping warm down there? 
 As warm as I can. (then) 
 No, no. You'll be alright. (quietly to Parker) That's probably really bad. I gotta move, so I need you to- 63. 
 
 
 What? 
 Look at me- is my face changing color anywhere? 
 I don't..I can't see anything.    I 
 
 But it itches now... 
 I know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off. 
 (O.C.) 
 I'm trying man, I'm trying. 
 Careful. 
 Stop talking. 
 (O.C.) Lynch.   I think the- 
 DAN, STOP TALKING. 
 Don't look down. 
 
 Do you got it? 
 Shh. 
 What's wrong? 
 Please no.     Please no... 
 (O.C.) Come on, Lynch! You had it! 
 I got you. 
 Don't look down. 
 
 Don't look down there, Parker. 
 (O.C.) Lynch?   What's wro- 
 Oh shit.   Oh shit. 
. 
 
 YEAH, MAN. 
 (O.C.) (crying) 
 
 I'T. 
 (O.C.) 
 
 (O.C.) Don't let her look! 
 I should...try and... 69. 
 (emotionless) Why did you let him jump? 
 You can't be fucking serious. 
 It was too far. 
 He said he could do it. You didn't 
 
 You're his girlfriend! I didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him! 
 
 Oh, but he would have listened to me? I said it was a bad idea! I 
 But you... You should have... 
 What?   Say it. 
 I didn't say that. 
 
 No, no, I- 
 You know what? If we hadn't spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass 
 I'm sorry. 
 
 That's not fair! 
 And it's not fair that my best friend is DEAD! 
 I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!     I'm just- I'm just- 
 -Fuck you. 71. 
 429... 
 5...5...shit, what was it?    5520? 5020? 
 5022. 
 5022. 429-5022. I'm so gonna call that girl when we get home. And you know what? I'm gonna marry her. No messing around. I'm just gonna be like "Hey Shannon, it's me Joe from the chair lift. Will you marry me?" And then we're gonna get a house and have 2 kids and a dog named Steve. 72. 
 Who's gonna pay for the house. 
 She will.    Shannon's got a great 
 What does she do. 
 
 Orthodontists make a lot of money. 
 
 I bet you guys will be really happy. 
 429-5022. 
 Who names their dog "Steve". 
 I will. 73. 
 Steve's a "people" name. 
 Says who? 
 
 
 "Here, meet my cat Chris." 
 No cats.    Just a dog.   Steve. 
 Shayna must be so hungry. 
 What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's? 
 
 She won't starve to death and you're not going to die. 
 No one else has a key to my place. 
 The neighbors will break the door down if she doesn't stop barking. Someone will figure it out. She'll be fine. 
 I would have had Shayna for a year this month. I got her a year ago for Christmas. 
 I know.   But you'll see her again. 
 Dan and I were spending Christmas with my parents this year. We won't be there though. (then) 
 Uhh... 76. 
 I...thought I was dreaming.   This. I thought this was a dream. 
 What? 
 Your frost-bite.   It's getting...worse. 
 Really?    How bad is it? 
 Don't.    It's bad. 
 It's not as itchy any more. 
 
 You have some dark spots on your face, too. 
 They'll fix me, too then.   Just 
 For what? 
 I don't know. Mountain maintenance. Besides, when none of us show up for class people are going to start looking for us. 
 No one's gonna look for me. I skip class all the time. By the time anyone notices I'm gone I'll be dead. 
 Can you please just think ONE positive thing? Please! 78. 
 Besides.   No one knows we're here. 
 (to the sky) HEL-LO!!! WE NEED HELP!!      HELP!!! 
 Are you sure you don't just wanna give it a few more hours? What if you're right? What if someone is going to come up here, even though they're not open today? 
 UP HERE!   SOMEONE HELP US! 
 I just wish I could stand up. Get out of this position for a minute. 
 If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you. 79. 
 No.     I can't. 
 Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this. 
 (quickly, sternly) No. I'm fine. 
 Alright. 
 Hey...hey Parker... 
 
 Shit, I thought you stopped breathing... 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Yeah. 
 OK.   1...2...3- 
 It was all that pizza talk. 
 I have no strength. 
 
 Damn it. 
 Maybe later. 
 What? Like I'm gonna feel better if I wait a little longer? I should have done it last night while I still had some strength. 82. 
 There's more snow fall on the ground and it's all fresh. Maybe the jump won't be as bad now. 
 Even if it was a foot deeper- it 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Nothing.   Let's sit and do nothing. 
 (O.C.) 
! 
 How come you never have a girlfriend? 
 How am I supposed to answer that? 83. 
 I mean, you're a decent guy. Girls dig you. But you never stay in a relationship. 
 I had a serious girlfriend once. 
 High School doesn't count. 
 
 Who? 
 This girl Annie. I met her at orientation. We emailed all summer and when we started school, it was like we were already going out. I 
 
 She um... same favorite movie as me. E.T. It was like soul mates 
 So then... what happened? 
 Same old shit. (then) No. You know what happened? She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don't know who it was exactly, but every time I'd go to her room some guy named "Dean" had left her notes and shit. 84. 
 Why did she keep it? Was she trying to make you jealous? 
 I don't know. I think she just liked getting attention. 
 So she dumped you for a frat guy? 
 
 That's messed up. 
 I've never felt so stupid and bad in my life. (then) So I left. 
 You just walked out? 
 Yup. Told her to go laugh with "Dean the Frat guy". I was out. 
 That sucks. 85. 
 Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I 
 You should call her. When you get home. You could tell her that. 
 I can't. (laughs) She's dating Dean. 
 I should have done something. 
 There was nothing either of us could have done. 
 I sat here and let him die. 
 
 He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna marry. 
 Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little... 86. 
 Sounds like Dan. 
 You have no idea. But then, the teacher... Mrs... What was her name? Mrs. Schifrin? She was trying everything to get the fat kid to stop crying. And so she 
 And so he had to sit with you? 
 For a week! For my whole first week of school I'm sharing my little cubby desk with his fat ass! 
 I loved him so much. 
 But if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here, that's bullshit. 
 Yes. 
 So I need you to pull it together, and we're gonna get out of this shit. We're gonna get out of this 
 Yes. 
 Help me up. 
 
 Are you OK? Do you have it? 
 Rrruh! 
 Oh my god! 
 Shit!    Hold on, just hold on! 
 (whispered) Please God...please God....please God... 
 Rrrugh! 89. 
 You can do it. Please do it. 
 
 
! 
 (through gritted teeth) Got it. 
 The chair is gonna fall! 
 No.    No it's not. 
 You made it! 
 Not yet.   Halfway. 
 What? 
 I said THROW MY POLE AS FAR AS YOU CAN THIS WAY. When I get on the ground I'll need some defense. 
 Oh shit. 91. 
 
 (whispered) Please god, don't let me fall. Don't let me fall. 
 Shit. 
 WHAT? 
 
. 
 WHAT'S WRONG? 
 NOTHING.    I'M GONNA GO FOR IT, OK? 
 ... 
 (to himself) OK. 
 YOU DID IT! YOU DID IT! 
 
 
 LYNCH!? LYNCH!!! (then) ANSWER ME!!! 
 
. 
 (O.C.) ARE YOU OK? 94. 
 I'M GONNA GO GET HELP.       I'M GONNA 
. 
 Hurry.   Please. 
 (O.C.) 
 NO!   JOE! 
 I'M GONNA GET YOU HELP!

 (crying) 
! 
 AHHHHH!    STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME! 
 OK. 
 Just don't move!     I'm getting help! 
 (to herself) Lynch. 
! 
 (meekly) Joe...? 
 Please.   Stop. 
 Hey!   Are you OK?!   Hello! 
 (into phone) I don't know. I found her laying in the road alone. Looks like she was in some sort of accident. Right outside of Mount Holliston. I'm taking her to you now.

 (V.O.) My name is Tom Van Allen ... (beat) or Danny Flynne ... 
 (V.O.) Methedrene was first distilled by a Japanese scientist before WWII. Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a good thing when they saw it. 
 (V.O.) This guy's so tweaked, he probably thinks he can survive this without a scratch. 
 (V.O.) Maybe not. (beat) By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese population had a meth problem after the war: factory workers, soldiers, pilots.  Maybe that's why it took two bombs to get 'em to surrender.  A nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined tweaker. 
 (V.O) In the fifties, the housewives got ahold of it.  Dexedrine. Benzedrine. Methedrene ... 
 (V.O.) There were even rumors that one of our presidents dabbled with mysterious "energy shots".  Imagine that: a slammer in the White House. 
 (V.O.) By the late 60's the government finally cracked down and sent the whole thing underground.  Bikers controlled the market for a while. 
 (V.O.) But now anyone with a basic chemistry kit and the right ingredients can cook it up at home. 
 (V.O.) Ever see a long-haired tattooed freak buying up all the cold medicine he can lay his hands on at three in the morning. 
 (V.O.) Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid, match heads for red phosphorus, ether and of course the cold medicine .. that's for Ephedrene, soon to become Methedrene 
 It ain't right 
 You think? 
 Something's off. 
 We can do better. 
 So the alphabet, I mean look at it, there's 26 letters.  Why not 27 or 28 or 106?  And the vowels: a, e, i, o, u. What the hell is up with that? 
 And sometimes y. 
 What I'm saying is that I love it! It's great. I could go on all night about it. 
 (V.O.) And so this is where I find myself. No. I should choose my words more wisely: this is the world I sought out.  The land of the perpetual night- party.  Day swallowing night and night swallowing day.  The crank compressing time like some divine piston on its awesome downstroke. 
 (O.S.) OH SHIT! WE'RE OUT OF DRUGS! 
 How the hell did we get this detail? 
 Guess it's our turn. 
 What time is it? 
 Twelve 
 Midnight? 
 Where to? 
 I know a guy. 
 Lead the way. 
 Nice day 
 I hadn't noticed. (beat) I've seen you around.  What's your name? 
 Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn. 
 Why's that? 
 My features. They're Finnish. 
 You don't say. 
 Finland is a country. 
 Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack. 
 Bobby? 
 Shhh. 
 (likewise whispering) What? 
 The spiders. 
 Aha! Yeah! (super rapid-fire) You thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby! 
 It's me ... Jimmy 
 Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy. 
 Yeah. 
 What can I do for you? 
 Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us. 
 Don't pay her no mind. 
 Hey man, take it easy. 
 What? 
 Come on.  Ease off the girl. 
 Did you bring the plastic men? 
 Did ... you ... bring ... the ... plastic ... men? 
 Nah, we didn't bring 'em.  That's just your good crank talking, brother. 
 (calmer) You bring the plastic men? 
 Like I said. 
 Fuck man. Come on, Bobby. 
 Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... (he draws a blank) 
 Hobby? 
 That's a good man. I like that. 
 (calmly) Hey, Bobby, look .. What you got going with your old lay, it's none of our business. We're just a couple of dope fiends trying to score. 
 Two eight balls? 
 Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy. 
 Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin' 
 C.I. number 678-43K-107 (beat) Tanner and Garcetti 
 (lying on the back seat) I've got a hot one. 
 You go, boy. 
 If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville. 
 Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we? 
 Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat. 
 You got a name? 
 Bobby, rhymes with hobby. 
 What? 
 Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts. 
 No last name? 
 It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries. 
 This the guy? 
 It speaks! 
 That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though. 
 Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne. 
 Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards. 
 What's he holding? 
 (O.S.) Couple of eightballs, maybe more. 
 (O.S.) Any company? 
 (O.S.) Alas, the lovely Mrs. Bobby was playing the bologna in a Posturpedic sandwich (beat) And there was a kid. 
 (O.S.) A kid?  Are you sure? 
 Yeah. Pretty sure. (beat) Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too. 
 God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker. 
 Somebody has to help you lazy bastards. 
 Danny, I'm touched. 
 Don't be. I'm worried about the kid. 
 Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there? 
 Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts? 
 I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne. 
 Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect. 
 You're welcome. 
 (approaching) Let me help you with those. 
 INSERT - CAN 
 I was rude. I'm sorry.  I'm kinda new around here. 
 You did the right thing. (handing the can over) What is this stuff anyway? 
 Fermented soybean curd. 
 Yummy. 
 Colette Aragon. Thank you, Danny. 
 My name is Tom Van Allen (beat) I play the trumpet. 
. 
 That's so ... (not finishing the word) 
 DANNY / TOM Melancholy? 
 Yes, it hurts my heart.  What a beautiful composition. 
 DANNY/TOM And the performance? 
 (goofing) A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece. 
 DANNY/TOM Thank you.  Thank you very much. 
 And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it. 
 DANNY/TOM Again, I thank you. 
 I was talking about Miles. 
 DANNY/TOM You, madam, are a heartless wench. 
 And you've got wiener breath. 
 DANNY/TOM Really? 
 It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch. 
 (laughing) Tom! Gross! 
 DANNY/TOM You know how I make that song melancholy when I play it? I think of what my life would be like without you. 
 Tom, let's spend the night here. 
 DANNY/TOM There's no motels around here. 
 No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it. 
 (at the vanity, whispering) Okay, we'll stay.  We'll stay. 
 DANNY/TOM (on the beach) Come on, Liz. We'll get eaten alive. 
 (at the vanity, softly) No ... We'll stay. 
. 
 You think I'm a Judas? 
 Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord. 
 Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit. 
 Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins. 
 Thanks for not judging me. 
 It's not my place. 
 Don't you wonder why I do it? 
 The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill. 
 You don't find that repugnant? 
 Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know. 
 Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid. 
 Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him. (beat) Now take the money. 
 It's a long story.  Maybe I'll tell you all about it some day. 
 I was getting to it. 
 (to Tanner) Tell me what? 
 I'll tell him. 
 (worried) Tell me what? 
 (mock concern) Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back? 
 Yeah.  What about him? 
 Turns out he's connected. 
 To who? 
 The Mexicali Boys 
 And what does this have to do with me? 
 He knows somebody ratted him. 
 What?! 
 And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was. 
 Shut up, Garcetti! 
 If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man. 
 Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people. 
 How the hell am I gonna do that?  You guys are still stringing me a long on that possession charge. 
 (mock surprise) You mean that hasn't been cleared up yet? 
 Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me. 
 Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time? 
 Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A. 
 When? 
 Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out. 
 (checking out the painting) Ride 'em cowboy) 
 (southern twang) You like that? 
 Who wouldn't? 
 First rate, ain't it? 
 It's downright classy is what it is. 
 Get in, hoss.  We'll talk it over. 
 Jimmy, you don't look so hot. 
 I'm hurting. 
 You on a roll? 
 Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me? 
 Sorry. 
 Why does it have to feel so bad? 
 You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer. 
 Oh yeah. (guzzles some beer) Man, Danny, how do you keep your shit together so tight? 
 That's a good one. 
 I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'. 
 I guess there's just no substitute for good genes. 
 Yeah, it's a pity.  Truly a pity. 
 I kind of doubt it, Jimmy. 
 So, why'd you want to see me? 
 Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash. 
 See that?  That's just what I'm talking about. 
 What? 
 You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man. 
 Don't get carried away. 
 I find myself in dire need of some cash. 
 You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up? 
 Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire. 
 I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth. 
 A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ... 
 A quarter of a million, Jimmy. 
 Fuuuuuck 
 Can your man handle that? 
 I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him. 
 Can you set that up? 
 Sure. 
 I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price. 
 10%.  That's ... 
 25 grand.  You introduce me to your boy, I'll cut you five grand out of my take.  That's all you gotta do, just get me in the door. 
 Mister, I only deal in high-end weapons.  All guaranteed stolen and traceable only to their original owners.  All sales are final and all prices are negotiable. 
 Jimmy, where do you find these people? 
 The Del Ammo Mall mostly. 
 You wanna score some go-fast? 
 Not tonight. 
 Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway? 
 Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world. 
 (sees Danny eyeballing him) You mad dogging me, Bitch? 
 Heavens no. I was just admiring your boots. 
 Did you purchase them locally? 
 You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over. 
 You mean, like to throw 'em off? 
 Yeah, that's what I mean. (beat) Where the hell does this guy live anyway? 
 Palmdale 
 Why do they call him Pooh-Bear? 
 I think on account of his nose. 
 You're going to have to explain that one. 
 He doesn't have one. 
 You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy. 
 Well, you know how Winnie the Pooh always got his nose stuck in the honey jar? Well, Pooh-Bear snorted so much crank, they had to cut his nose off. He's got a plastic one though. 
 You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep? 
 No (beat) You think she's a tweaker? 
 POOH-BEAR Okay, here we go gentlemen ... 
 Ready. 
 POOH-BEAR Oswald? 
 Roger that. 
 POOH-BEAR Grassy knoll? 
 Ready 
 POOH-BEAR Third shooter? 
 It's a go. 
 POOH-BEAR President Kennedy waving to the crowd, his lovely wife looking radiant beside him as they turn into Dealey Plaza ... 
 DANNY/JIMMY (ad-libbing) - Cool. - Yeah. Interesting. 
 POOH-BEAR (holding up the camera) I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission. 
 Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while. 
 POOH-BEAR No shit? (thinking) Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard. 
 (O.S.) Pooh-Bear! We got a problem. 
 POOH-BEAR So, Danny, Jimmy tells me you have a proposition for me. 
 Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth. 
 POOH-BEAR Crank or glass? 
 The good stuff.  Can you handle that? 
 POOH-BEAR I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste? 
 No, I'm good. 
 POOH-BEAR I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste. 
 Not bad. 
 POOH-BEAR Secret recipe. 
 Can we talk price? 
 POOH-BEAR Make me an offer. 
 I don't know, 14,000 a kilo? 
 POOH-BEAR I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me. 
 Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce. 
 POOH-BEAR (enthusiastic) Hey, okay. 
 You're serious? 
 POOH-BEAR Anything for a dear friend. 
 But I just met you. 
 POOH-BEAR But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already. 
 So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then? 
 POOH-BEAR If you say so. 
 Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously. 
 POOH-BEAR Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously. 
 Why do you say that? 
 POOH-BEAR I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman. 
 Hey, I was just trying to ... 
 POOH-BEAR (never losing his smile) I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal. 
 Hey, I don't play that. 
 POOH-BEAR I'm sure you don't.  At least I'm sure you think you don't.  Anyway, I want to tell you. It's a good story, guaranteed to break the ice at a party. 
 POOH-BEAR (V.O.) You should have heard him howling. 
 POOH-BEAR Then I took a Saws All and I cut His skull open 
 POOH-BEAR (V.O.) (calmly) You know, those Saws All really do cut through everything. 
 Look, you don't have to ... 
 POOH-BEAR 10,000 a pound 
 Now you're insulting me.  Nice talking business with you. 
 POOH-BEAR 9,000.  Take it or leave it. 
 I'll leave it.  Eight is as high as I'll go.  See ya'. 
 POOH-BEAR All right, all right. Don't get your knickers in a knot. I can live with eight. 
 POOH-BEAR God damn, Danny, you got some nerve. Pooh-Bear respects that. (beat) Oh, by the way ... 
 POOH-BEAR (in the grocery store) Hmm. Good price. 
 You want a hit? 
 No. I'm good. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Sure, Jimmy. 
 What does J.F.K. stand for? 
 John Fitzgerald Kennedy. 
 Was he the president? 
 Yes, Jimmy 
 Danny? 
 Yes, Jimmy. 
 Thanks for not laughing at me. 
 (softly, a la Perry Como) Sugar Plum Fairy never once gave it away. Everybody had to pay and pay ... 
 Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday. 
 What is it, drugs? 
 Better than drugs. 
 Bob Hope's stool specimen (beat) We're gonna boost it. 
 Why in God's name would we want to do that? 
 So we can sell it. 
 To who? 
 I don't know.  A collector.  Fuck Danny, it's Bob Hope. 
 He is a national treasure. 
 Check it out.  This is the lab. 
 What is that? 
 It's the lab. 
 I mean what kind of drink? 
 Cuba Libre 
 What is that? Rum and coke? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it? 
 No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up. 
 You should use something smaller. He's the same size as the office. It doesn't ring true. 
 (O.S.) And the colored girls sing doot-de-doot .... 
 (O.S.) He delivers at four o'clock on the nose every Friday.  Alpha team will be in the elevator with the courier. That'll be Danny and Creeper. 
 Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team. 
 I thought you were done. 
 I said hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side ... 
 So what's it gonna be, Danny boy? You in or out? 
 (watching Colette) I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on this one, boys. 
 You okay? She nods. 
 Quincey, my boyfriend... he kicked me out. 
 Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved. 
 I understand. Thanks anyway. 
 Thanks. 
 Don't be. 
 Jesus, I look like a raccoon. 
 I was thinking Alice Cooper. 
 Oh God. 
 Come on, cheer up. It could be worse. 
 How? 
 I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen. 
 What about the guy on the very bottom? 
 Leave me out of this. 
 That bad, huh? 
 Nevertheless, I still try to see the glass as half-full. 
 Could be worse. (beat) Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to. 
 Ouch. 
 Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now. 
 This man sounds like a real catch. 
 Oh, he's a keeper all right. 
 Colette ... 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Go ahead. 
 Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy? 
 It's not that easy. 
 Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt. 
 Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? (beat) I hate the son-of-a-bitch. 
 Then leave. 
 I can't. 
 Why not? 
 You don't understand. 
 There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig. 
 I can't leave. 
 You get off on abuse or something? 
 Fuck you. 
 Then why don't you leave? (beat) Just give me one good reason. 
 Because he'll kill me. 
 Why don't you call the cops? 
 Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two. 
 That's long enough to get out of town. 
 I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live. 
 Then make sure he gets put away for longer. 
 How? 
 I don't know. (beat) Let me think about it. 
 (Texas drawl) I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes. 
 Why? The guys is ready to deal now. 
 Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner. 
 Now that's down-right insulting. 
 I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules. 
 (O.S.) (filtered, broken) I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice. 
 (O.S.) (filtered) Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss. 
 You thinking what I'm thinking? 
 Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for. 
 Hold it right there, Flynne. 
 Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack! 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Question is, what are you doing here? 
 I was trying to score some dope. 
 Cut the shit, Flynne. 
 Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here? 
 Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play. 
 (serious) What did I do?! 
 (shrieking, failing) You think this is funny motherfucker? 
 (still laughing and covering up) I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl. 
 Garcetti, do something. 
 We know what's going on. 
 (in pain) I still don't know what you're talking about. 
 Okay, let me help you.  You're setting up a deal with a Chinese redneck. Quarter of a million. 
 Jimmy? 
 Who the hell is Jimmy? 
 He's the only one I told. 
 And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news. 
 I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services. 
 This chink have a name? 
 Bubba. 
 You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne. 
 After that ass-whipping you gave me? 
 (finishing up with the bundle) What's on the other end of this thing? 
 Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy. 
 Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne. 
 Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips. 
 What're your taking down? 
 Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory. 
 Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off? 
 Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him. 
 Wrong. 
 You mean you want me to roll on these guys? 
 You've got no choice. 
 Whata you mean I've got no choice? 
 Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ... 
 For that old possession charge? Gimme a break. 
 No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al? 
 Dime, minimum. 
 (O.S.) And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat. 
 (O.S.) That's not good in prison. It's just not good. 
 What's that smell? 
 That would be me. 
 What'd you do, piss your pants? 
 Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler? 
 Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses. 
 Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood. 
 No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack. 
 Bullshit. He's a liar. 
 News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat. 
 You think you're so god damned smart, don't you? 
 Why didn't you just ask for directions back there? 
 DANNY/TOM Come on, where's your pioneer spirit? 
 You mean like the Donner Party? 
 DANNY/TOM Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious? 
 Tom, quit fucking around. 
 DANNY/TOM Okay, okay. (peering through the windshield) There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions. 
 You think that's a good idea? 
 DANNY/TOM What do you mean? 
 Look at that place. It's creepy. 
 DANNY/TOM First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it? 
 I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost. 
 DANNY/TOM Just no pleasing you, is there? 
 Just admit you're wrong. 
 DANNY/TOM We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy? 
 Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old. 
 DANNY/TOM No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up. 
 Here it comes, poor Tom. 
 DANNY/TOM But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right. 
 That is so unfair. 
 DANNY/TOM My sentiments exactly. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 ... Tom ... screw it.  Tell me when you're ready to apologize. 
 (on the bed, whispering) I'm sorry, Liz. I love you and I'm sorry. 
. 
 (O.S.) This seat taken? 
 Oh. Hi. 
 What happened to your eye? 
 Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure. (beat) By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set. (off her puzzled look) Where's Quincey? 
 Don't worry. He's out of town. 
 How far out of town? 
 Trust me. We're safe. 
 Miles Davis. "All Blues." 
 Never heard of him. 
 Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music. 
 Like you? 
 Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part. 
 Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest. 
 And you admire that? 
 It's the only way to play. 
 Is that how you play? 
 I try. 
 No false notes? 
 No deep dark secrets? 
 (cold and abrupt): What are you up to? 
 Nothing. 
 What do you want from me, Colette? 
 I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious? 
 It gets me through the day. 
 You really need to lighten up. 
 Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after. 
 This has nothing to do with him. 
 So you're just attracted to me, is that it? 
 Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe? 
 How much time do you have? 
 What is wrong with you? 
 How much time do you have? 
 You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield. 
 Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers? 
 There you go again. You're nothing but false notes. 
 You don't like the tune, find another station. 
 What are you hiding, Danny? 
 Therapy session is over. 
 You think you're the only one down here with a sad story? 
 No. But I'm the only one with my sad story. (beat) And that's how it's gonna stay. 
 Excuse me? 
 Several possession charges, but nothing major. 
 Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy? 
 They have. But they never found a lab. 
 That's because he doesn't have one. 
 Whata you mean?  He told me - 
 Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is. 
 What's to stop him from just ripping me off then? 
 That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme. 
 You're lucky, Flynne. 
 Funny, I don't feel lucky. 
 We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered. 
 What if he caps me before you can make a move? 
 Golly, I hadn't thought of that. 
 Don't we always take good care of you? 
 Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me? 
 You mean the menacing red car? 
 What? Is it bad? 
 I'm afraid so, Danny. 
 Who is it? 
 Brace yourself. 
 Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys? 
 Worse. Much worse. (beat) A teacher. 
 Car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer. 
 She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years. 
 Now that's scary! 
 You're paranoid, Flynne.  I think that crank is finally starting to get the best of you. 
 (V.O.) When is the deal going down? 
 (V.O.) I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week. 
 You sure you don't want me to go with you? 
 Pooh-Bear, my man.  What's up? 
 He's blue. 
 Comin' down from a 10 day ride. 
 You want to do this some other time? 
 POOH-BEAR (gloomy and tired) Pull your pants down. 
 I'm sorry? 
 POOH-BEAR Pull your motherfucking pants down. 
 (laughing nervously) Come on, guys ... 
 POOH-BEAR Big Bill. 
 Argh, matie. I'm a pirate. 
 POOH-BEAR Little Bill 
. 
 (trying to stay calm) Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this? (off Pooh-Bear's silence) It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal. 
 POOH-BEAR Big Bill 
 POOH-BEAR Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police. 
 What?! 
 POOH-BEAR Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation. 
 Please .. I don't know what you're ... 
 POOH-BEAR Uh-uh-uh ... 
 Jesus Christ. (to the weasel) Um ... I'm not .. Captain Steubing. I'm not working for the cops. 
 POOH-BEAR He don't believe you. Big Bill. 
 Drop your package in the cage. 
 My what? 
 Put your pee-pee through the hole. 
 This is fucking crazy! 
 Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. 
 Oh fuck ... oh Jesus ... 
 POOH-BEAR Shoot him. 
 Okay! Okay! 
 POOH-BEAR Now get talkin' 
 I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God! 
 POOH-BEAR You got something to tell Captain Steubing, you'd better do it now. 
 (rapid-fire) Captain Steubing, listen to me. You're after the wrong guy. This is the fuck you should be talking to. 
 That's a pack of discharge. 
 It's true. Jimmy saw him flashing a pimp role at a bar the other night ... said he was dissin' your ass in front of one of your customers. 
 POOH-BEAR Man'll say a lot of thing when he's sporting weasel food for a pecker. 
 Damn straight. 
 POOH-BEAR Least I can do is check it out though. 
 Can I pull my dick out now? 
 (holding up his arms) Go ahead. I got nothing to hide. 
 Can I pull my dick out? 
 He's clean. 
 What? 
 CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?! 
 POOH-BEAR (eyes on Little Bill) Yeah. 
 I ought to just call this whole thing off right now. 
 POOH-BEAR Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny. 
 What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0? 
 POOH-BEAR No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time. 
 Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel? 
 POOH-BEAR I'll keep that in mind. 
 We're in business. 
 Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat. 
 That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks. 
 We got the 411 on your good old boy. 
 Murder.  Beautiful. 
 Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant. 
 You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit. 
 Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead. 
 Took a pig-slicker to the heart. 
 Jesus. 
 I thought you'd be happy. 
 Yeah. 
 Who is it? 
 (O.S.) It's Tom. 
 All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down? 
 Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you. 
 Highway Patrol. 
 He said you were ... the people you Were with ... well ... 
 Said you were a drug addict. 
 Maybe I should just go. 
 No. We want to help you, Tom. 
 Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there? 
 I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ. 
 Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife? 
 You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding. 
 Maybe I am dealing with it. 
 I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ... 
 Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there? 
 That was my idea. 
 You never did like me much, did you Verne? (beat) And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you? 
 Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, a persecute you. 
 I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me. 
 Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker. 
 I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred. (beat) Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like? 
 It's not too late to show her you're sorry. 
 How? 
 By not disgracing her memory! 
 What does that mean? 
 You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter? 
 You don't understand. 
 Understand what? 
 Nothing. It's ... it's complicated. I just want you to know ... I'm not what you think I am. 
 Who is it? 
 (O.S.) It's me. 
 I'm kind of busy. 
 (O.S.) Please open the door, Danny. 
 Oh Jesus. 
 We been through that. 
 What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you. 
 I need my paycheck. 
 You can still work. 
 He knows where I work. 
 Find a new job. 
 It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money. 
 You always been this stubborn? 
 From day one. (beat) I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em. 
 Ass first into the world. 
 I been that way ever since. 
 COLETTE/DANNY Ouch. They laugh. 
 Can we try that again? 
 I can't. 
 Why not? 
 I just can't. Okay? 
 What's wrong, Danny? 
 Look, maybe you oughta' leave. 
 No. I want to know what the hell is going on. 
 I can't tell you. 
 There's someone else, isn't there? 
 Yes. 
 (O.S.) I'm so tired of lying. CUT TO: 
 What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway. 
 DANNY/TOM That's it? 
 Are you Australian? 
 DANNY/TOM No. 
 Good. I fucking hate Australians. 
 DANNY/TOM You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road? 
 Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all. 
 DANNY/TOM (to Liz) You mind? 
 No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it. 
 DANNY/TOM I was talking to my wife. 
 Try to make it fast. 
 You know. This and that. 
 Skeeters. They're bad up here. 
. 
 Let's go! 
. 
 She died knowing that I was a coward... that I didn't lift a finger to help her. 
 There was nothing you could have done. 
 No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something. 
 They would have killed you too. 
 (finally looks her in the eye) Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now. 
 (looking up) Colette...I want to help you, with Quincey. 
 No Danny, Don't- 
 Really, I don't want to. 
 I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change. 
 What is it? 
 Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away. 
 I don't want to. 
 I'm offering you the chance to take care of your problems. Take it. (she still hesitates) Don't make the same mistake I did, Colette. Do something while you have a chance. Do it for your daughter before something happens. (beat) Believe me, you don't want to live with this burden. (firm) He helds the baggie out again. Colette reluctantly takes it from him. 
 Will you do that? (off her nod) Then I want you to get out of the room. 
 Why? 
 Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back. 
 Just do it. All your problems with Quincey will be taken care of. 
 What's this? 
 Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare. (beat) It's for you. 
 But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight. 
 You aren't coming with me. 
 Okay 
 Wait till I tell you what it is. 
 It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me. 
 Why? 
 You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you. 
 Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you. 
 Hey, check it out... 
 What the hell is that? 
 (Proudly) It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh? 
 What? 
 I'm not a tweaker. (beat) I don't use drugs. I never had. 
 But...I've seen you. 
 When? When did you ever see me use? 
 This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it? 
 You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one? 
 No one ever noticed? 
 Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy. 
 But... why? Why would you pretend? 
 I can't tell you. 
 You don't trust me? 
 I don't trust anybody. 
 And you want me to do you some big favor? 
 Wait (beat) If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs? 
 Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers. (beat) I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear. 
 You mad at me, Jimmy? 
 I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning. 
 I'm sorry. I couldn't. 
 You know you can get that tattoo removed, don't you. 
 Nah... I want to keep it. (beat) Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox? 
 Good for you Jimmy. 
 I really want you to take this. 
 Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done. 
 You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn. 
 Yeah. 
 Everything go? 
 Yeah. 
 Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises 
 I ain't a idiot, asshole. 
 I'll see you tonight. 
 Man of few words. 
 Nervous? 
 With you clowns watching my back? What do you think? 
 Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there. 
 Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident. 
 He's coming in. 
 (O.S.) How'd it go? 
 You tell me. 
 You ready to go meet the team? 
 For those of you who don't know this is Tom Van Allen... a.k.a.  Danny Flynne. 
 He's a civilian? (off Trahn's nod) How the hell did you pull this off? 
 I played the long shot. Just got lucky. 
 How about the car? The model? 
 All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on. 
 Not even a guess? 
 (pissed off0 How many times do we have to go through this? 
 Yeah, but he was in silhouette. 
 How about in the house? 
 They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this. 
 Did you see his hair color? 
 No, Why? 
 Forensics found this on your wife. 
 What is it? 
 Nothing, I'm trying to remember... 
 Why didn't you tell him? 
 Because I wanted to find them myself (beat) I wanted to kill them. 
 (V.O.) I swear to God I would have done 'em right then and there...but I had to be positive.  And even if Tanner was involved, I had to be sure about Garcetti 
 (V.O.) So I became Danny Flynne. 
. 
 (V.O.) I dropped myself right in their laps. 
 (V.O.) I gave up whoever they asked for, whenever they wanted. I was a fucking dream rat. But the whole time I was sizing them up, looking for any evidence that they were the guys who killed my wife. 
 (V.O.) But they did everything by the book. 
 F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY 
 I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it. 
 That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan. 
 These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer. 
 (V.O.) We had one of our C.I.'s call Tanner and Garcetti with an "anonymous" tip about the deal. 
 (the line takes on a whole new meaning) This could be the one we're looking for. 
 (V.O.) ...I dumped a dummy file into the system. They took the bait and we were off to the races. 
 How sure are you that you're not chasing two good cops? I mean all you've really got  is one red hair. That's still your only evidence. 
 Not anymore. We tapped these guys' phones and computers at Gardena P.D. Tanner and Garcetti didn't report on this deal. Not a peep. They haven't coordinated with Palmdale P.D. They're keeping it off the books. It looks like we've got the right guys. (beat) We'll find out for sure tonight. 
 How you holding up? 
 I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself. 
 Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive. 
 Oh shit 
 What? 
 Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help. 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Hey guys... 
 (O.S.) (filtered) I need to stop for some cigarettes. 
. 
 (into min-mike) All right people, heads up.  Blue team? 
 I've got a visual. 
 (filtered) Red team? 
 He's heading to his room. 
 (filtered) Black team? 
 Okay.  It's all yours. 
 Half an hour to kickoff. 
 (O.S.) It's open. 
 You alone? 
 Danny told me to tell you that he was sorry. (beat) He said he had to take care of this himself. 
 Here he comes. 
 Easy, boy. 
'S P.O.V. 
 Where's Bubba? 
 Maybe he isn't showing. 
 Looks like Flynne's handling the cash. Let's get into position. 
 What the hell is this? 
 POOH-BEAR Just some buddies. 
 This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here. 
 POOH-BEAR What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead? 
 Come on, man, let's deal. 
 POOH-BEAR Cool it. We got business. 
 Yeah, dickhead. 
 POOH-BEAR Oh my, oh my. (beat) Big Bill, come take a look at this. 
 POOH-BEAR Oh lordy, oh lordy, oh lordy.  Pooh- Bear done shot himself. 
 Anybody there? 
. 
 I'm here, Liz. I'm here. 
 INSERT - CARD 
 Get the bag. 
 Danny? 
 My name is Tom. 
 Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this? 
 Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ... (beat) You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ... 
 Please ... don't do this ... 
 Answer the fucking question! 
 Does that answer your question? (beat) I fight. I fight and I die like a man. (beat) You're a fucking coward, Flynne.  You lived like one and now you're gonna die like one. 
 (mumbling) Glock semi-automatic 9 mm ... 
 Tenifer matte finish, Polymer grip, fixed sights, 4 and 1/2 inch barrel, 22 ounces, double action and a ... 
 ... and a TEN ROUND magazine ... 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Too late to be a hero. 
 Ten it is. 
. 
 (softly) You're dead. 
 My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a trumpet player. 
 (O.S.) Nah, you're Danny Flynne. 
 You're a motherfucking rat. 
 You said you wouldn't kill him! 
 You lied to me! 
 Oops.  My bad. 
 Colette, what happened?  Didn't the cops ... 
 The cops came.  But they didn't find nothing.  Turns out their C.I. game 'em some bad information. 
 You set me up? 
 Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo. 
 You're good, princess. I'll give you that. 
 Danny, it's not what you think. 
 I owed them money ... a lot of money ... they didn't give me a choice.  You know how it works.  When I got to know you, I tried to back out ... that's when they did this ... (she indicates the bruises) But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I didn't want to see you get hurt. 
 She selling me a bill, home boy? 
 Nah, she ain't lying.  She took a pretty good beating from you, ace. I seen grown men crack after a lot less.  But not this bitch. (beat) It was very touching. 
 Then why are we here? 
 They threatened to kill my daughter. (beat) I had no choice. (beat) I'm sorry, Danny. 
 It's okay. It's okay. (Danny touches her face.) (beat) God damn, you're beautiful. 
 Jesus. 
 No! 
 You wanna die here with him or come with me? 
 Colette, go. 
 I don't want to leave you. 
 Your daughter needs you.  Go. 
 (V.O.) So what is it?  Who am I after it's all said and done? 
 (V.O.) Oh shit. What is this? 
 (warped, distorted) Hang in there buddy. 
 (V.O.)

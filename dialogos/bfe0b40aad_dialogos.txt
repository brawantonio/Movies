. Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays. 
 Nanotherapy, beta version: Tuesday, March 10, 2011. Female Test subject Number four. Franklin reaches for us, smiles... 
 Here we go, Bright eyes. A MIST fogs our view for a moment. 
 Not too much. She needs to be calm, but alert. 
 Scanning. 
 Stuff looks like Kool-aid. 
 Go ahead, I'm sure you could use it. 
 (OPENING VALVE) Starting the therapy... 
. 
 She's convulsing. Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube, listens to Bright Eyes' heart. 
 (INTO INTERCOM) Please keep the monkey still. He focuses back on the monitor. 
 CAROLINE (INTERCOM) She's not a monkey. Will looks from the monitor to Caroline. His look is intense, tough to read. She blushes slightly at the heat of his gaze. 
 Here we go. Will stares at the scan, his eyes willing the test to succeed.. .the green liquid LIGHTS UP THE CHIMP'S BRAIN. 
 (BEAT) Good work. 
 What is this? Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM, a lit-up board with colorful symbols. Bright Eyes presses a button. 
 Tree. 
 And this? The chimp presses another button. 
 Acorn. 
 Where does the acorn come from? Bright Eyes considers... then presses a button. 
 Acorn. 
 Yes, but where does the acorn come from? 
 Acorn. 
 
 Acorn. Tree. Acorn. The chimp looks at Caroline, who's stunned, trying to process the ADVANCED THINKING JUST MANIFESTED. Then she presses another button. 
 We started the therapy four weeks ago. This was yesterday. Will's studying the scans. They look good. Real good. 
 CAROLINE (CONT'D) There's been clear cell growth. Both on the frontal lobe and the neocortex. She's purposely standing close in order to point this out. He notices but doesn't respond - there's history between them and he's regretting that - gets in the way. 
 No - it's conceptual. Acorn gives us a tree, which gives us an acorn. 
 In a chimpanzee. Unheard of. Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline moves away from him. He barely notices her now. 
 CAROLINE (CONT'D) You're calling her a monkey just to piss me off, aren't you? 
 (BEAT) And double this one's dose. 
 John... is that you? 
 As thou dost, Anthony. (staring at the keys) .he hears no music. No music... 
 (heavy Russian accent) He's been doing that all day. A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA. 
 He found an old book of his. She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back. 
 IRENA (CONT'D) (shrugging on coat) I had no idea you liked Shakespeare so much, Mr. Walter. 
 
 (KISSES HIM) Good night, Walter, hone-ee. She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm. 
 I rather tell that what is to be feared than what I fear: for always... I am Caesar... There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries.. 
 John... ? 
 Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam. Monty. Hey - what's the matter, don't like my cooking? 
 FRANKLIN (CONT'D) You okay back there? 
 Something wrong with Bright Eyes? 
 I'll check on her when we're done. Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner. Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his cranium. From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open door as Lucky's strapped down. 
 You could at least try to look excited. 
 You'll do fine. Just speak English. Keep the science simple. 
 Okay. Back it out... 
 Your turn. Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD, HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO 
 DONNIE (CONT'D) C'mon - Let go - She understands what he wants but she won't do it. THAT'S 
 DONNIE (CONT'D) Hey! Something's wrong with number four! Franklin looks over - he's still dealing with Lucky on the table... 
 Be right over - Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something different in her face today. Rage? Force of will? 
 What's the matter with you? 
 (AWKWARD) Alzheimer's affects the entire neocortex, the hippocampus, and large subcortical regions of the brain... 
 Hey!!! Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other apes begin to SCREECH. Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to. 
 DONNIE (CONT'D) Someone get her off of me! 
 Hang on - Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries over. He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY. 
 What Dr. Rodman has done is to invent a virus that can, for the first time, cross the membrane that protects the brain and deliver a genetic, therapeutic, payload. 
 Meaning? 
 She's breaking my hand! 
 Let go, Bright Eyes! You're hurting him! She tries to help pull Donnie away. 
 CAROLINE (CONT'D) Let go! In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own. 
 Lucky no! Stop! 
 #1 Uh oh. Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN 
 #2 Hey, Len...? Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket... Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet... 
 What about the safety of the virus? 
... â€¢ BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK. The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again. 
 Long gone. Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway. 
 Look around you, for Christ sakes. We'll be lucky if we don't go to jail. Will's gutted - devastated. 
 You think you're the only one who's got something at stake here? I've got my own skin in this game! 
 - 
 What makes you so damned positive about that? (pauses for emphasis) What if this drug does things you don't understand? Are you going to take responsibility for that? Because I'm sure as hell not going to. Here Will hesitates. 
 JACOBS (CONT'D) We're not ready for human trials. Hell, we weren't ready for monkey trials. 
 This is what we're going to do: You're taking a sabbatical. I'll let the board handle the lawsuit. When this blows over I'll bring you back and we'll start over - we'll do it right this time. With mice. Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody. Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say. 
 Â€¢ Show you something, boss? 
 I just put down fifteen animals, Dr. Rodman. The least you could do is give me a moment of your time. Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long, devastating day. 
 They're all gone. 
. Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded. 
 They carry small. Must have been pregnant when they brought her in. Will tries to get his mind around the situation. 
 No one. 
 (BEAT) I'd bring him home, but my brother- in-law works for security. He'd rat me out in a second. That's when will realizes. 
 He's an orphan now. 
 You don't believe that. 
 Just for a couple days. Until I can find a sanctuary. 
 I heard you outside, fighting to keep them alive. 
 - 
 she was just trying to protect him. 
 Bright Eyes - the mother. That's why she wouldn't let anyone into her cage. Will looks down at the helpless baby. 
 Tell you what, Doc. (producing a syringe) I'm done for the day. So you be my guest. Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will. It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his little hands. Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's belly... but there's no way he can go through with this. Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who watches from outside the cage. 
 Hey man. Congratulations. 
 It's Friday night. I had a date. 
 (using American Sign 
) You're welcome. NOTE: Whenever Caesar communicates he's signing and there will be subtitles. 
 Is he going to turn left or right...? The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a piece of cheese. Will does his best to hide the excitement blooming on his face. 
 Same success rate as the primates. Congratulations. 
 Â€¢ He's right on target. Height. Weight... She checks Caesar's ears. 
 Dairy Queen. 
 What about diet? 
 Ice cream. Will ignores him. 
 What's he saying? 
 He seems extremely intelligent. How many words does Caesar sign? Beat. 
 Soft-serve. 
 I've heard of apes learning up to a hundred and fifty words. Is he good with puzzles? Will hesitates. 
 Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously happy. You're doing a great job with him. (doesn't want to alarm) But there is an anomaly I noticed. 
 When I was examining his eyes, I noticed a strange green pigmentation. 
 Green. Never.seen it before. She hands Will an OTOSCOPE. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) Take a look. Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds 
 STEWART (CONT'D) It's faint, can you pick it up? He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) You alright? Want a glass of water? 
 Carotid pulse is running a little fast. 
 Gotta remember to eat. 
 What's the best score? 
 
 (O.S.) Ham! 
 TODD'S BUDDY Check it. He wants to play. Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile. Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her brother throws the ball to his Buddy OVER CAESAR'S HEAD. 
 Monkey in the middle. Todd's Buddy LAUGHS. Caesar LAUGHS too, although he's not sure what's funny. 
 Caesar! 
 You don't know that. 
 Hah! Hah - Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him. 
 Your monkey came onto my property! Threatened my kids! By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate. 
 Damn right it won't happen again! I'll press charges if it does! Will holds Caesar close and hurries home. 
 What does he do for fun? Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little thrown by the question. 
 My guess is he needs more. More exercise, more space. 
 (BEAT) What do you do for fun? She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't understand the question. 
 I'm sorry, did you say something? He starts to try again - but the moment's gone. 
 Take him off the leash. 
 A. 
 Go ahead. Climb! The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element. Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and Walter become smaller and smaller down below. 
 
'S. He runs two fingers down the length of it. 
 But we're still making progress, right? Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written all over his face. 
 This isn't graduate school - there's a procedure we have to adhere to. 
 How's your father? Haven't seen him in a while. 
 He's worse, isn't he? Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't. 
 Who Caesar. 
 Who. With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and tries to understand what Caesar wants from him. 
 CAESAR (CONT'D) Who. 
 (SIGNING) A chimpanzee. 
 No "what". "Who". Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual leap Caesar's taken. 
 Walter Will father. Will Caesar father? Will looks at the chimp - sees the intensity, the pain on his face. How to begin to answer? 
 Caesar mother? 
 Caesar go. Caesar see. Will locks the car door. 
 Caesar mother... Will grows concerned. 
 (O.S.) Let's see if we can find something for you on the TV... 
 The Icarus crew is led by Commander Colonel George Taylor. This is his fifth space mission... 
. 
 Look at the front of my car you stupid, stupid old man! You should be locked up! Your son's going to pay for that damage - 
 Caesar... Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his fists. 
 Help! Get him off - 
 Caesar... no... Stop! Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back. But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old man off his back. Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE 
 Aaaaaaaah! Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE 
 Caesar! Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes. 
 WALTER (CONT'D) Please stop. Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and sprints for his house. 
 Please no... Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph. But then he sees something across the street that abruptly pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY - 
 (V.0.) .chimpanzee named Caesar, terrorizing the quiet family enclave and mauling neighbor Douglas Hunsiker, a pilot for Global Airlines. 
 The defense claimed the chimp was merely trying to protect its owner from perceived aggression. FOOTAGE OF WILL LEAVING A COURTHOUSE, avoiding News Crews. Jacobs sits forward, turns up the volume. 
 REPORTER (CONT'D) The chimpanzee's distraught owner, Wilson Rodman, has raised the animal since he was an infant. 
 REPORTER (CONT'D) He pleaded to keep Caesar at home, citing the ape's remarkable intelligence. Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded. 
 Real animals? 
 Will sad? 
 Where animals? 
 (SHAKING HANDS) This is Caesar. 
 MR. LANDON Nice to meet you, Caesar. This is Dodge, helps me run the place. 
 MR. LANDON Yes, we have a big play center where the chimpanzees like to climb. 
 MR. LANDON What do you think, Caesar? Want to give it a try? Trying to mask his growing dread, Will removes Caesar's harness. 
 That's about it for visiting hours. Will shoots him a look of daggers. 
 MR. LANDON What Dodge means is, in our experience, longer you drag out the leave-taking, harder it is. On both of you. Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth. 
 MR. LANDON He'll be fine. Will gives Caesar a last, long look. The pain in his eyes is matched only by Caesar's. WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away. Caesar's SHRIEKS build. The SURROUNDING APES chime in...a 
 Caesar. Hey. I can get you out. Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) This way. 
. 
 Caesar - over here. Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE 
 DODGE (CONT'D) Stupid monkey. 
 (O.S.) Okay, assholes. Dinner time. Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening look to Caesar - moves off. Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out. Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in an occasional rotted vegetable. The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet- looking dog food. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow. Bet you don't get none of that in the suburbs. Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) Think that's funny? That funny to you, you hairy prick? Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER. 
 Look at that! Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage. 
 One thing you can count on: Long as there are humans on this earth, you'll always be a monkey in a cage. The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards. Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his back as a shield. The water BLAST is relentless. Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the floor. 
 What about his clothes? Might cause problems with the other apes. 
 Leave 'em. 
 (O.S.) John? Walter enters, looks at Will. 
 WALTER (CONT'D) John - where's Caesar? The old man looks stricken. 
 WALTER (CONT'D) Shouldn't we look for him? Isn't there something we can do? Will looks up at his father. He's just had an idea. 
 You've been gone a week. 
 Too sick to return my calls? You know it was a funny thing, but I was watching the news and they started talking about a seven-year- old chimpanzee that went nuts - and all of a sudden, there you were on the TV. A seven year old chimp, raised since birth. The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his voice. Neither man cares. 
 Aside from biting off a man's finger. 
 We've had this conversation already. We knew the 112 was making the apes smart - 
 You're out of your mind. Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit there. And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious. 
 Did it? 
 (BEAT) It brought my father back. But Jacobs is confused. 
 You told me he was failing. 
 Why have you waited so long to tell me this? 
 'Him'? 
 The ape? Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity. 
 (BEAT) But only under one condition. It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged. 
 You're giving me conditions? I could have you arrested for what you've done. 
 
 (THROWN) How the hell can I do that? 
: THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty. And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla, BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on toward the atrium. The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK. Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps, orangutans with orangutans. They haven't noticed him yet. 
 Caesar. Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head. 
 Do you remember me? I'm Dr. Stewart. She hands him a cup of water with a straw. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) Drink. Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly doesn't understand. He signs again. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) I don't understand. Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW SOUND. She's taken aback - is he trying to speak? 
 STEWART (CONT-D) Can you show me? Show me what you need. Caesar pulls at the restraints. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) I can't take those off. Caesar sags with defeat, overcome with DESPAIR. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) I'm sorry this has happened, Caesar. So sorry. Stewart stares at him. Moved at the complexity of his emotion, the obvious intelligence behind his pain. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) I'm here once a week. I'll do my best to look after you. 
 (O.S.) What were you thinking? 
 oh, hey Doc. 
 That chimp needs protection. Dodge's face falls. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) You could've gotten him killed. 
 
 (A) I told Rodney not to open his cage. 
 Can't you see how sensitive he is? How intelligent? 
 Yeah, no, he's a real smart dresser. 
 I want him moved to the orangutan house. He'll be safe there until we re-introduce him to the group. 
 I'm sorry, since when do volunteer animal doctors make the rules around here? 
 Please. Just do it. 
 Whatever you say, doc. Dodge returns to stacking the chow. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) You're the one with the college education. 
 Dr. Rodman - I think there's been a mistake. Will's been waiting for this observation - he's surprised it took so long to come up. 
 But... isn't it risky? I mean, at this rate of propagation, we greatly increase the possibility of mutations that are out of our control. It's a highly unstable - 
 Sorry to drop in on you like this. The clinic at the zoo gave me your address but they didn't have a phone number - 
 No - thanks. I just wanted to let you know that I've seen Caesar. Seen Caesar? 
 I volunteer once a week at The Ranch. 
 Yeah. He had a rough start, but things should get smoother from now on... In the other room, Walter and his Aide become visible. Will follows Stewart's curious gaze. 
 Oh. Sorry. 
 (BEAT) Anyway, Caesar's going to be okay. I'm looking after him. 
 Well. If you give me your number I'll let you know from time to time how things are going - 
 Love to. 
 Want a beer? The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) Here's a little taste of beer... He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH. Caesar watches, disgusted. 
 DODGE & RODNEY Move it! Let's go! Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move across the bridge. On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE, ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out, then moves off to join the others. Caesar maneuvers to get a better view. Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS 
 
 (SIGNING) Home now. Caesar home. He tugs Will away from Dodge. 
 
 (SIGNING) Home. Still a question, a flicker of hope. 
 (loud enough for Will) No place like home, huh monkey boy? 
 That was not a smart thing to do. Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's too angry to care. 
 That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours any more. He's mine now. The truth of the statement is worse than any punch. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) And you're on private property. Now get the hell out of here. 
 (O.S.) Morning Caesar. 
 How's your arm? Mind if I take a look? Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS, cuts off his bandages. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) Looking good... Caesar makes eye contact with Dodge over Stewart's shoulder. She pulls a harness from her bag. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) I'm taking him out. Thought I'd cheer him up, show him the horses. 
 No way. As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG. 
 What are you going to do? Use a cattle prod on me? 
 If you're into that kind of thing. 
 I'm safer with him than I am with you. 
 Answer's no. 
 I can't take you. (glancing at Dodge) Maybe another time. 
. 
 (O.S.) Nanotherapy, beta version: Male Test Subject Number eleven. 
 
 (THROUGH MASK) Boy, he's a calm one, isn't he? Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO 
 You actually punched him? 
 I've been wanting to do that since the day I met him. 
 Here. Let me help you out. She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his chopsticks. 
 I know you are. 
 Happy gorilla. Caesar's shocked. 
 MAURICE (CONT'D) Surprise. 
 Signing orangutan. 
 Maurice circus orangutan. 
 More ape sign? 
 No. Maurice alone. They HEAR DODGE'S WHEELBARROW APPROACH. 
 Careful. Stupid human no like smart ape. Dodge begins shoveling primate chow into the troughs. Maurice and Caesar stop signing and blend in. 
. Rocket GRUNTS and sprints after him - through the chimpanzee common area - toward the door - Where WHAM! CAESAR WHACKS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH ROCKET'S 
. 
 MOUNTAIN: BUCK. Buck raises his arms and SLAMS them down with a MIGHTY ROAR; Caesar slings the plastic refrigerator aside, sending it SKITTERING across the CONCRETE. The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen. Rocket looks from Buck to Caesar. He's beaten. 
 Yeah. I'm good. 
 You wanna know if I think the 113's making him nuts. 
 (CATCHES HIMSELF) .I don't want to start human trials if there's any chance of danger. 
 What you're seeing has nothing to do with the 113, Doc. The apes're just like us - they're complex. Some are loyal, some are selfish, some have a good sense of humor. And some are born rotten. Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of view, from inside the cage. Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his â€¢ face frame the two men across the room. 
 FRANKLIN (CONT'D) This one's a bad apple, that's all. A chill runs down Will's spine. 
 
 (OPENING GATE) Early day today, Evans? 
 Actually I'm not feeling too good. 
 You know what: Whiskey, lemon, honey and a cup of hot water. Never fails. 
 Thanks - I'm on it. Evans drives off. 
 Still won't eat, won't come out. 
 I can fix that. Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) Get that monkey ass out of there! 
 Why cookie Rocket? 
 Need strong. All apes strong. 
 No understand. Caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and BREAKS IT. 
 Gorilla. He breaks another twig. 
 CAESAR (CONT'D) Orangutan. He breaks another. 
 CAESAR (CONT'D) Chimpanzee. He grabs a bunch of twigs and holds them together - now they can't be broken. 
 CAESAR (CONT'D) Apes. 
 Sorry - can't get him to come out. He won't budge. 
 I told him. Will brushes by Rodney, heads for the cages. 
 RODNEY (CONT'D) Hey - you are not allowed back 
 (BEAT) It's about Walter. 
 (O.S.) NASA has temporarily lost communication with the Icarus. 
 Captain Taylor and his crew are navigating the ship around the dark side of Mars. Communication is expected to be reestablished - 
 You tried. You worked really hard. Walter knew that. 
 Just checking in. You didn't show up at work today. 
 (O.S.) Hope you're feeling better - let me know if you need anything. 
 Where go? 
 Find Mother. 
. As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to go with him. Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER. To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S 
. 
. 
. Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick, stares back at him. Caesar turns away, crestfallen. 
. But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight. 
 Rise and shine, assholes. The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in the common area. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) What the hell - (seeing Cornelia's open 
) You sly son of a bitch. How'd you do that? Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds it in front of him. He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) We're gonna go slow here, alright? You're gonna go back in your cage, you're not going to give me no trouble. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) Back! Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips. Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples, Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT. Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward the orangutan cage. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) We're going to have you fixed, Einstein, that's for damn sure... But first we're going to figure out how you pulled this off... 
 DODGE (CONT'D) Go on. Get in that cage. Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) I said get! But Caesar doesn't move. Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement floor. He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage. 
 DODGE (CONT'D) Get in that cage, you damn dirty ape! 
. 
 (with his voice) No! 
. 
. 
 (O.S.) Will? Hello? Will pick up the goddamned phone! 
 The animal handler - Franklin - was killed last night. In the primate house. 
 Something very powerful broke his neck. Snapped it in two. 
 All our apes are accounted for - â€¢ secured in their cages. But here's the kicker: One of our security guards swears he chased a chimpanzee off the grounds last night. Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's swing. 
 JACOBS (CONT'D) Where in the hell did that chimp come from?! 
 MR. LANDON The Ranch. Landon speaking. 
 MR. LANDON She said that - 
 
 (ON PHONE) No one's answering. In the distance they can HEAR the PHONE RINGING at the ranch house. From where the car is, nothing out of the ordinary is visible. Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car. 
 Not a way in the world. I'm coming with you. 
 Oh my God... I'm calling 911.. Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window. HE SEES: Debris everywhere. Apes free, wandering... DODGE, LANDON and RODNEY BATTERED AND IN CAGES. 
 It's going to take them at least half an hour to get here. He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a couple of stray COOKIES. He has an idea. Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
 
 You're wrong - he can't have been the one who killed that man - 
. Will and Stewart run to the front room, just as the door 
 Welcome to the mad house. 
 I called Animal Control - they'll be here soon - 
 Well this'll be interesting because your freak'll talk back. 
 Dodge thinks he spoke to him. 
 He did! He said the word "no" - right to my face. 
 He can talk. 
 That's impossible. 
 Then he must have a voicebox in his ass, because I heard him! Caesar walks up. Will steels himself, feels in his pocket - the POISONED COOKIE is ready. 
 
 (SIGNING) Apes no belong in cage. Human put apes in cage. Will's heart sinks as he sees that Caesar is intransigent. He means what he's saying. 
 CAESAR (CONT'D) 
 (SIGNING) Never again. Will takes a moment, DIGS DEEP TO MAKE HIMSELF DO WHAT MUST 
 
 (SIGNING) Never. They look at each other. Two creatures once so close, but now with a vast chasm between them. 
 
 (SIGNING) Caesar no kill. 
 
 (SIGNING) Caesar no kill! Caesar SLAPS the COOKIE from Will's hand. Rocket immediately comes over to stand by Caesar, but Caesar doesn't want to fight. He's done - disgusted - with Will. He turns, begins to walk off. 
 
 (VOICE STRAINING) No. At the sound of Caesar's voice, the apes rise tall. FROM THE CHIMPANZEE HOUSE Will and Stewart watch, stunned. 
 CAESAR (CONT'D) C...Cage! The humans' jaws drop, petrified. 
 CAESAR (CONT'D) 
 They could be spread out all over the County by now. Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER HUFFS. Dodge, Rodney, and Landon huddle nearby. 
 
 There's a leader? 
 
 Reason with him? Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad car. Will follows, Stewart on his heel. 
 (to nearby JUNIOR OFFICER) Get on the horn with every agency you can think of! We've got to track down these monkeys before they do major damage! The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge follows. 
 You need me riding with you. I've got experience with these animals. (eye on Will) I can point out the one you want. 
 (handing Jacobs a card) If you think of anything else, this is where I can be reached - A RUMBLING SOUND from behind. They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way. Shocked, they leap out of the way as best they can. 
 We have a situation at Gen-Sys Laboratory! Approximately two dozen apes, gorillas, I don't know what the hell they are - AUDIBLE CHAOS from inside the lab. YELLING, SCREAMING, 
. 
 You know anything about this? 
 #1 Here they come! 
 #2 There's more of them! 
 
. Jacobs freezes. KOBA APPEARS from around a doorway. He and Jacobs look at each other for a long moment. Then Koba calmly walks past him. 
 Any idea where they're headed? Will sees Dodge joining SHARPSHOOTERS in another helicopter below. He doesn't like it. 
 They were seen heading north from the lab - let's start with that. 
 Monkey! OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then another. And another. 
 GIRL (CONT'D) Mommy? The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't get to her. 
 April! Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up and puts her down out of harm's way. Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where he's going. SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase. 
 You see them? 
 Oh my god. Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW: it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl - chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along parallel streets... She realizes something. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) I know where they're going. 
 What the hell am I supposed to do when they get here?! An APE screams into a wall phone at the Ape Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know something's coming. Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers, turns to see Caesar and his apes. Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth. The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys. 
 That's him! The one with the white on his shoulder! A SNIPER takes aim at Caesar - the BULLET RICOCHETS OFF THE 
. 
 Where to, my man? 
 24 Marigold. 
 Want me to turn down the air? 
 
 (DESPONDENT) Whatever. 
 
 (INTO HEADSET) Shut down the Golden Gate Bridge! 
. 
 
 
 (INTO HEADSET) Tell them to hold their fire until they get past the traffic! WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a place on the bridge where there are no more cars. Then they'll be open season. Then HE SEES the FOUR SQUAD CARS slowly approaching from the north end of the bridge, SHARPSHOOTERS - and DODGE - on foot behind them. 
. Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE. Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and swirls hundreds of feet below. Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing, taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him. Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps. Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into the fog. Rocket's right behind. The remaining apes follow. 
 Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top. They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND 
. They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them. BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables. Another chimp falls to its death. Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's practically zero. 
 They're all around us! Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH - 
... DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful of some visibility. That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG, 
! Rocket's hit in the back! He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE 
 As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON 
. 
. Terrified but refusing to run, Dodge fires, reloads, fires 
 #1 We can't gas the forest! The slightest wind would take it over to Tiburon. 
 #2 Well it'll take us months to find them in there. 
 #3 Not to mention rounding them all up. Will approaches the group. 
 This man owns one of the chimps. 
 (BEAT) The so-called "leader". Says he can reason him out. 
 #1 You think you know where to find this monkey? Will starts to correct him - lets it go. 
 #1 We don't have a lot of options. Let's give it a try. 
 Whatever it takes. 
 Definitely. He thought so. 
 STEWART (CONT'D) He's never going to agree to come out with you. 
 (can't quite hear him) What? Will waves it off - never mind. Stewart watches him walk down the trail... and disappear into the woods. 
 Follow me. Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S 
 Hang on a second... (to nearest Officer) Where are they going? 
 STEWART (CONT'D) 
 Humans coming. 
 Will want Caesar dead. 
 (BEAT) Can you forgive me? BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path. Will realizes he's been betrayed. 
 (PANICKED) Wait - no - 
 Will leave. 
 Will leave now. 
 APES' FAVOR. 
. 
 Where to, my man? It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT 
 SFO. International terminal. 
 You got it. The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his forehead - he doesn't look too good. 
 #1 (O.S.) As the ape search continues, a virulent flu strain has exploded in and around San Francisco, sending shock waves and panic throughout the community. 
 #2 Authorities suspect the origin of the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys Laboratories - the same private company from which several laboratory chimpanzees escaped earlier this week - We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see it's filled with apes - chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas. We keep pushing in, closer and closer to the trees. As we move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK. MAURICE. AND, SITTING 
 #3 As the death toll rapidly rises, Hospitals are desperately trying to meet the growing demand... Caesar sits alone, staring straight at us. 
 #4 
 #5 Efforts to quarantine appear to have failed. The strain has been spotted as far away as Singapore and Australia... 
 #6 
 (LONG BEAT) For those of you who can hear me, I say... 
 (VOICE BREAKING)

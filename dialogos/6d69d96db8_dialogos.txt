 That play, my friends, sums up the Redskins' running game all day long. Now Washington calls their last time out. 
 Hey, the Dolphins do this as good as anybody. See, in a four, three, two, two, you got the guards... boom!... Plugging up the middle, then the corners... boom and 
 Third and twenty-two, but forget the first down with eight seconds showing and the Skins down by a touchdown. 
 Could be the last play. 
 Could be the last play of the season if the players go out. 
 (V.O.) Take it all in, people. This could be it for 2,000. 
 (V.O.) Once again, if you haven't heard, it was announced during halftime that the N.F.L. Players Association will hold a press conference immediately following this game -- that would make it about five o'clock Eastern time -- and it is expected that 
 
 (V.O.) It's all about money, folks. More money, of course and ain't it always? The shame of it is the big losers are you out there, the fans. 
 
 (V.O.) Here we go: Third down, eight seconds to play, ball on the Dolphins' thirty-three yard line. Skins down by a touchdown. 
 Green 48! Green 48! Hut! Hut! 
 (V.O.) 
 Well... Martel goes down ten yards short of a score. 
 On maybe the last play of the season. 
 I think he might have slipped. 
 Yeah, there's a lot of that going around. 
 We're    coming to your house    tonight, and we're    gonna fucking kill    you! And if you got a    dog, we're gonna kill    your fucking dog too! 
 
 Did they win or lose?! 
 That has the distinct tonal quality of a loss. 
 Nice medicine for a loss. Keeps us calm. Makes us not so sad. Keeps us on an even keel. Gives us some perspective, doesn't it? And we'll save the winning medicine for next Sunday, won't we? 
 O'NEIL If you keep talking to me like I'm a five- year-old, I'm going to hurt you. 
 Sounds exciting. 
 We'll want to talk to coach now, won't we? 
 O'NEIL (on the phone) What the fuck was that?! 
 (on the phone) I think he slipped. 
 O'NEIL Bullshit he slipped! He could have scored! 
 Mister O'Neil, let's face facts: The players are going out. It's gonna happen. And nobody wants to get hurt on the last play before a strike that could go on for the rest of the season. 
 O'NEIL You god damn wimp! You're fired! Get out! Get out! Get out! 
 Better? It always makes you feel better when you fire someone, we know it does, don't we? Yes... 
 O'NEIL Get me Jimmy McGinty. Get him here. Tonight. 
 Hey, man, I do what my 
 But you're already one of the highest paid players in the game. The fans just don't see the point of a player like you striking. 
 Let me tell you something: I'm a big man, you see? 
 There are some days when I am so beat up, that I cannot dress my own big ass. I asked management for a valet or some shit to help me dress and they said no way. So, fuck 'em! 
 (O.S.) Shut up everybody, here it is... 
 
 (V.O.) I have just left a meeting with representatives of the owners and I am sad to say that they have refused the players' final demands which 
 LINDELL (V.O.) (CONT'D) Therefore, I am recommending that all N.F.L. players walk out and not play until our demands are met. I want the players to walk out tall, to walk out righteous, to walk out in the knowledge that we do this as a team. We shall overcome the fat cats. I send peace to my union brothers. 
 Shit, I'm goin' to Vegas. 
 O'NEIL I'm dying, Jimmy. 
 O'NEIL Gimme a butt. 
 O'NEIL No. 
 O'NEIL You pussy. I want you to come back as head coach. I fired that asshole Tilden today. 
 O'NEIL We're gonna finish the season anyway. All of us owners decided. We're gonna use replacement players. 
 O'NEIL Us, greedy?! What 
 O'NEIL No team owner in their right mind is gonna give back those T.V. revenues. (MORE) 
 O'NEIL (CONT'D) All we promised Fox was twenty-two guys with a pulse every Sunday. But think about it, Jimmy. We got a great opportunity here! We got a chance to put a team on the field that plays the game just for the love of it. Like we used to play it. 
 O'NEIL Jimmy, I'm really dying. The doctor says I'll be gone by Superbowl Sunday. Help me bring a winner back to D.C. You did it for me once before. You can do it again. 
 O'NEIL Come on. Wouldn't it be fun? A bunch of poor nobodies who play to win instead of a bunch of bitchy millionaires? You can put it together, Jimmy. Player's love you. They always have. 
 O'NEIL Tell me you're gonna do it. 
 O'NEIL Absolutely. 
 O'NEIL Sure, Jimmy, sure. 
 O'NEIL Deal. 
. 
 ... Six phone lines with internet access on two: One for defense and one for offense. 
 We thought we would skip special teams for the moment. 
 Except for a kicker. We definitely need a kicker. A place kicker over a punter. 
 The thinking being that if we lose the toss, we have to be able to at least kick off. 
 Okay. Here's the list of every player cut this past season. What we would like to do is... 
 You won't need a center. 
 Bored and ready to retire. I'm just looking for one more hit. One more really good hit. 
 Hell, I'm rich. I got no complaint with Mister O'Neil. I just want a chance to play one last time. (MORE) 
 EVANS (CONT'D) Shit, I'd rather go out with a broken leg than sitting on the bench. 
 Did you hear something? 
 #1 Jesus, Bateman! Why don't you ever wait for us?! 
 #2 Not me. 
 What area code is 703? 
 #1 Washington, D.C. 
 Nice hands. 
 (not amused) What else? 
 A pack of Marlboro Reds, a pint of Martel Cognac and a box of Trojans, extra long. 
 Get out of here. I'm telling your mother you were talking like that. 
 Hey, Clifford, somebody on the phone wants you to play football next weekend. 
 Tell 'em I gotta work Saturday. And I'm watching the Redskins on Sunday. Ain't nothing stopping me from watching the Redskins on Sunday. (mumbling) No way that's gonna be 
 (into phone) He's gotta work. (pause) They said they'll pay you. 
 Pay me?    How much? 
 (on phone) How much? (pause) Ten thousand five hundred dollars! 
 (stunned) Ray, who the fuck is on the phone?! 
 (pause) It's the Washington Redskins! 
 (to someone) Get out of the way! (to someone else) Don't look at him! He don't like being looked at, god damn it! No eye contact! 
 And you look like that coach from the Seventies. From the Redskins. McGinty. Except you look a shitload older. 
 No, man, I've been out way too long. 
 You know what my nickname was in San Diego, don't you? 
 As in, I hear 'em and I dump the ball. 
 I got two concussions to prove it. 
 (truly shocked) No kidding? 
 Forty-five. And now you want to recruit me? 
 Okay.   What's my 
 I'm retired from football. 
 I like being here. It's quiet. I like being alone. 
 #1 Deuce and an eightball on Go Down, Rita in the eighth. 
 Louis, you got a phone call! 
 (from across the street) Who is it? 
 It's the Washington Foreskins. 
 What?! Ma, what are you, out a your tree? 
 (yelling louder) I'm telling you they said it's the 
 
 Cut right on me, now. Right on me. 
 Not right on me, goddamn it! 
 (O.S.) Coach Lamont! Phone call! Long distance. Washington, D.C. It's the Washington Redskins! 
 (to the sky) Thank you, Lord! 
 
 Nice. Try a roll to the right. 
 O'NEIL (V.O.) Shane 'Footsteps' Falco? This is what you're going to build an offense around? 
 O'NEIL Christ, Jimmy, I ask you to build me a team based on balls and the first player I see is Footsteps Falco?! 
 O'NEIL And he's got the happiest feet I've ever seen! 
 O'NEIL What about a safety? We got two a days starting tomorrow and a game in five days! And we still don't have a safety?! 
 Here we go. Nice fat little hits. 
 O'NEIL I called a friend of mine who just happens to be the Governor of Maryland. 
 O'NEIL Don't worry about it. 
 
 As president of the Players' Association, what does your presence mean here, Mister Lindell? 
 Very simply, support for these fine players and union men. Washington D.C. is the home of freedom and the collective bargaining agreement. I am here to remind all Americans that the owners are no better than the robber barons of the Nineteenth Century. They have blatantly gone out and hired scabs, which is against all principles of our Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and probably even the Emancipation Proclamation. 
 And here come the Scabskins now! 
 Scabskins! Scabskins! Scabskins! 
 Oh God, there's Eddie Martel! And Wilson Jones! I love Wilson Jones! Yo, Wilson! Yo, player! 
 
 Hey, Lou Pacifico. 
 Shane Falco. 
 I know. I lost a ton a money on that Sugar Bowl disaster of yours. Wow. Did you get your butt kicked or what? 
 
 You know I don't take that shit. 
 Be cool. 
 Scabskins! Scabskins! 
 He told me he was a linebacker! 
 I can see. 
 Two.   No, wait.    Three. 
 
 
 Oh my God. That's disgusting! 
 Not bad, Coach. 
 You got it. 
 You're not serious. 
 (to McGinty) I got a defensive end who's deaf!! 
 (watching Lee walk away) I'll trade you for a tackle who's gonna play in a diaper. 
 How can I coach a deaf man?! 
 I can't believe it! I got to be able to communicate with him. 
 
 Oh shit! No! 
 Hi, I'm Danny. 
 (groaning) Shane. 
 Thank's, Coach! 
 What was that? 
 I'm very interested in that. 
 
 A)    
 D)    
 E)    
 F)    
 G)   
 H)   
 Annabelle Farrell, head Redskinette. 
 Excuse me? 
 I'm in charge. Of the Redskinettes. The cheerleaders? 
 Oh yeah, hi. 
 I've been watching you. You look good. You look strong. Good quick release. Smart. You read defenses quickly. You're gonna do great. 
 Hey... thanks. 
 I saw your second concussion. The one 
 I guess so. 
 If there's anything you need, let me know. And I mean anything, okay? You understand? 
 Sure.   I understand. 
 They put you up at the Hilton? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. Remember: anything. You got it? Okay? 
 I know, Coach, I know. 
 Oh yeah, Coach, sure. In a, you know, romantic way. 
 Coach, wait! Can I still like touch my girl friends if I don't, you know, let go of the ball? 
 
 ... just glad to be back playing. That's all I've really got to say. 
 But where have you been? What have you been doing to make a living? 
 Well... I've been involved lately in the... aquatic business... 
 You only played one game?! 
 Actually, less than two minutes. I was a rookie third round pick in '93. We were playing Atlanta in the home opener. Near the end of the first quarter, they sent me in, I took a screen pass over the middle and got hit by both linebackers. Simultaneously. One a 
 Can you play on it now? 
 I've been teaching high school football for five years. It's not a bad life. I'm good at it. There are some days when I actually love it. But for one more shot at this? Shit. I'd give it all up. This time, they're gonna have to take me out in a box. 
 I got Wilson Boone's locker, man. Do you believe that shit? 
 Hey, you can't park there. 
 Look, I don't want any trouble. 
 You don't want any trouble?! You're taking my job away, but you don't want any trouble? (to Wilson) He doesn't want any trouble, but he puts this piece of shit in a no parking zone. 
 Okay.   I'll move it. 
 No, we'll do that for you. Go ahead, Wilson. Move it for him. 
 (O.S.) You all put that car back. 
 Who the fuck are you? 
 We're the people who take care of the quarterback. We're the guards. 
 Put the car back. Gently. 
 Kiss my ass. 
 (to Jamal) It's okay. 
 No, it's not. 
 (to Wilson) That's your ride, ain't it? 
 My windshield! You crazy motherfucker! 
 Move his car back. 
 My car! 
 No!   Stop! 
 Come on, help me, god damn it! 
 (to Jamal) You are gonna pay for this. 
 No I'm not. And quit messing with my man here. That includes his ride. 
 Let's go to practice, Shane. 
 Let's do that. 
 (O.S.) ... so if anyone does have any firearms, we need to turn those in as soon as possible, no questions asked... 
 Praise the Lord, Shane. 
 Yeah.   Sure. 
 Walt Cochran. Offensive tackle. 
 Shane, will you witness with me? 
 Will I what? 
 Will you witness with me? For this upcoming practice. 
 Now? 
 Praise the Lord for giving us a way to eliminate, Shane. Why not talk to Him in the midst of performing his gift? 
 
 Heavenly Father, thank you for allowing us to pee the poisons from our systems. Please help us in today's practice to be strong and... 
. 
 Where did you play, Judge? Wait. Do I call you judge? 
 Your Honor, or Judge is fine. I played at Harvard. But I played in the days when you went both ways. Offense and defense. When players were really tough. (to Wilkinson) And where did you play college ball... I'm sorry, what was your name again? 
 Smith. Ray Smith. I played at a junior college nobody ever heard of. What position did you play on defense, Judge? 
 Middle linebacker. 
 Yeah, big fellow like you, that's what I would have guessed. 
 It was a different game in those days. Raw. Powerful. No tricks, like today. 
 You know, maybe you can show me some of your technique, Your Honor. Maybe you can show me some of that toughness. 
 I'd be glad to! 
 (O.S.) You would think he's done enough. 
 McGinty, I mean. 
 I was kind of thinking the same thing. 
 My theory is he came out of retirement to see if he could win with losers. (pause) Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... 
 (interrupting) Hey, it's okay. I've been called worse. 
 Like    after that Sugar Bowl    game? I guess you could    survive anything after    that. 
 Sometimes I feel like everybody in the world saw that game. Like I could go to India and some little guy would run up to me and say, 'Boy, did you suck in 
 So, how come you're such a fan? 
 My dad. He's a huge Redskin fan. For years. He's in his twenty-ninth year at the Senate Office Building. As a guard, not a senator. The only thing that keeps him going he says, is me and the Redskins. That's where I get it. My fan-ness. (suddenly) Are you scared? 
 Scared? Well... yes. Absolutely. 
 It's okay. Anybody would be. But you're good. And you'll do good. 
 Well, thank you. Look, I gotta study the play book tonight. So... I'll see you. 
 Break a leg tomorrow. 
 What?! 
 It's    from the theater. For    opening night. You say    the worst thing that    can happen. And 
 Alright, this is how we used to stop a running back. 
 I can't wait. 
 Oooh... got me a judge! Man, that felt good! 
 (to kid) Don't be asking    for no autographs from    the real players and    then go in and watch    the scabs! 
 (to the player) That is not the message we want to send our children! 
 You okay? 
 Remember to nod your head on the snap. 
 (out of it) Nod my head? 
 For    when Murray's in. The    deaf kid. Hello? He    needs to look at you on    the snap. 
 What are you, crazy? Nobody eats right before a game. 
 I always ate before a big match. I need the bulk. 
 
 ... Pretty bold move by New England Patriot owner Victor Kiam, who went out and bought an entire semi-pro team once the strike happened. (MORE) 
 MADDEN (CONT'D) Redskin management, on the other hand, is going with a bunch of unknowns. Their public relations people don't even have bios yet on most of their players, although we'll see one or two familiar faces out there today. 
 Like Shane Falco, the enormously talented college quarterback from Ohio State, who never fulfilled his potential in the pro's. (to Madden) Wow, remember that 
 Oh, yeah, they were absolutely decimated! 
 Dusted. And if I'm not mistaken, Falco set a record in that game for Bowl interceptions. Anyway, for some of these players this is another shot; a last shot, probably, for a guy like Falco... 
 (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, your Washington Redskins! 
 
 (V.O.) Here's the starting defense today... 
 (V.O.) At middle linebacker, number 56, Daniel Bateman! 
 
 
 Oh, my... 
 
 
 
 
 Bastards. 
 (V.O.) And now... uh, the rest of the Washington Redskins. 
 
 That's where I stand. 
 No it's not. 
 Come on, man, that's my spot in the huddle. 
 
 ... Fat fucking nip! You don't know shit! 
 What did you call me?! 
 You heard me, you tub a rice shit! 
 Hold on, what's the problem here? 
 I'm gonna kick your black ass... 
 You ain't kickin' jack shit... 
 (to Lee) Don't be messing with my brother... 
 Hey, hold on... 
 
 Delay of game!    Five yards! 
 
 ... I don't know. Something seems to be going on in the huddle. It looks like... yes, Shane Falco is on his back. They haven't run a play yet but Falco is down. 
 This is not a good sign. 
 
 (clearing the cobwebs) What happened? Am I hurt already? 
 God damn it! I am the quarterback! I am the only one supposed to talk in the huddle! 
 Yeah, but he took my place... 
 I don't give a shit! 
 Huddle up! 
 If you've got something to say, raise your hand! Is that understood?! 
 Suppose like, you don't feel good. Or you're hurt or something like that. Then what? 
 Then you tell me before the huddle starts! Okay, listen up: 68 blue east storm toss. On two. 
 What?! 
 That's to the right... right? 
 No, it's to the left. 
 It's to the right! 
 You better be quiet, Shane, they'll hear you. 
 Delay of game!     Five yards! 
 Well, Pat, so far the Redskins have minus ten yards offensively. 
 ON O'NEIL 
 O'NEIL 
 Blue 68. Blue 68! Hut! Hut! 
 Have you suddenly decided you don't like me, Jamal? 
 Oh. You said it was to the right, didn't you? 
 
 Okay. Let's try something simple. 18 red left slot open. (to Jamal) That's to the left! 
 Eighteen red! Eighteen red! Hut! Hut! 
 Yeah! 
 Holding! Number 78. 
 You see. We should have prayed. 
 Shut up! Pass. 22 Solo right slot 'A,' Y stick. On one. 
 Twenty-two green.    Hut! 
 
 (V.O.) Washington comes up a minus fourteen yards on their first possession. 
 
 Wide right! You got wide right! Check on the wing! 
 Blue fourteen! 
 
 
 Green eighty-seven! 
 
 
 (V.O.) I think the Redskins just set a record for penalties in the first three minutes. We're waiting for the stats on that...

 SHANE'S POV 
 
 What? 
 I don't feel good. 
 Oh, God! 
 Oooooh... 
 Man, that's ripe! 
 Shane, we got to move! 
 Okay. On the count of three. Everyone more left. Hut! Hut! Hut! 
 
 What the fuck is this? 
 John, how many years have we been calling games together? 
 Seventeen, I think. 
 
 U brown right, west 19 A lead. That's you, Mickey. Puke on him if you have to. 
 
 
 (O.S.) Hut! 
 (V.O.) Very nice off tackle run by Lamont. Execution was letter perfect. 
 (V.O.) That puts the Redskins in field goal range. And here comes Pacifico to see if he can get them on the board before the half ends. 
 
 (V.O.) This will be a forty- five yarder. That's a 
 Hut! 
 
 
 We can't put three plays together without a penalty, a fumble of a fight. 
 You're good. You're really good. 
 
 Another terrific interception by Smith. That's his second. 
 Yeah, this guy is a player. 
 According to the Redskins, Ray Smith... is... that's weird. No college given, no high school given. It just says he's been a resident of the state of Maryland for the last four years and five months. Likes to embroider. 
 Okay, let's all take a few seconds to think about what we were doing for a living... just last week. 
 Good. Let's kick ass. Red right pass 15 x 
 Red fifteen! Red fifteen! Hut! 
 
 A)   
 B)   
 C)   
 E)   
 F)   
 G)   
 (V.O.) ... began with a Redskin end around, but Cochran, the pulling tackle ran into Falco's pitchout ... see? (MORE) 
 MADDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Right here, it bounced off his helmet. Then it was kicked by Landon and then Hayes touched it, I think, and then Green got a hand on it, and then Bellinski recovered it and then he lost it, and finally the ball took a crazy bounce right back into 
 
 
 Hut, hut! 
 
 
 SHANE'S POV 
 
 
 
 (V.O.) Falco is intercepted. That's too bad. 
 (V.O.) Yeah, and it looks like he's hurt, too. He was really starting to put it together here in the fourth quarter. Only forty-eight seconds now left on the clock. 
 
 The ball. Okay, Coach. 
 
 Hut, hut, hut! 
 
 
 I can't... 
 
 (V.O.) Here comes Falco with eighteen seconds left on the clock. 
 (V.O.) I'm surprised to see him again after that shot he took from Bellinski. 
 
 22 green! 
 Check! Black 43! Black 43! 
 
 What's that mean? 
 (whispering back) He's changing the play. Listen! 
 Black 43! 
 (V.O.) It's a long count. Falco could be calling an audible. 
 
 (to Shane) Is this right? 
 (shaking his head) Black 43 left! 
 
 Hut!   Hut! 
 (V.O.) Lamont scores! 
 (V.O.) Whoa! Falco calls an audible at the line of scrimmage and Lamont takes it in! 
 ON O'NEIL 
 (V.O.) With eight seconds remaining, Pacifico will try the extra point that will send this game into overtime. 
 (V.O.) This turned out to be one hell of a contest, Pat! 
 
 
 Hut! 
 (V.O.) It's a fake! 
 ON O'NEIL 
 
 We won, Shane.   We won! 
 ... ultimately, it's a pain thing, you know? I mean, it's Darwinian, the survival of the numbest. Whoever can take the pain most, gets the largest contract. It's sick. 
 IN RED Exactly. Let me buy you another. 
 (slurring) I'm glad that you are concerned. 
 I would like. 
 Here's home. 
 (looking at both women) Oooooh. Bookends. 
 (to the girls) Go away. Both of you. 
 (to Annabelle) These are my guests. 
 Why did you do that? 
 You were about to be rolled. 
 (as he enters) That's what I was hoping. 
 They work the bar downstairs looking for drunk Redskins. 
 I guess they found one. 
 Don't feel so bad. It's a rookie mistake. 
 
 Here.   Take this. 
 (groaning) What is it? 
 It's for the pain. Take it. It's only a little bit illegal. 
 Oh, God. I've got to go to the bathroom. It's far away, isn't it? 
 I'll help. We'll just take our time. 
 Kidneys. 
 Oh, man. My hair hurts. 
 You took a hell of a beating. The martinis didn't help, either. 
 Don't be afraid if you've got blood in your urine. That's normal. 
 (O.S.) Did you undress me? 
 Yes. 
 (O.S.) And you... slept here with me? 
 Yes. 
 (O.S.) Did we... ? 
 Are you kidding? You were catatonic. 
 No blood. 
 Good.   Back to bed. 
 May I ask you a personal question? 
 Do you do this for all Redskin quarterbacks? 
 Of course not. 
 Then why me? 
 I don't know. I guess I can't resist a man who can take a hit. 
 I can't take a hit! 
 Shhh. It's all in your head. Now, get some sleep. 
 You're the golden boy in the press this morning. 
 'Falco scores big.' (to herself) Well... not really. (still reading) Hey, a lot of the regular players are starting to cross the picket line. 
 (O.S.) Redskins? 
 It doesn't say. 
 Where are you going? 
 McGinty called a dinner meeting with the whole team. 
 Thank you. Thanks for... everything.     You saved my life. 
 No. Probably just your wallet and your watch. 
 And that pill, that sure worked. 
 You're basic double D Vicodin. But be careful: It's habit- forming. The best stuff always is. 
 Well... 
 Ice both knees and that shoulder before bed. 
 
 B)

 D)    
 O'NEIL I'll give you 50 thousand dollars for a bite of that steak! 
 Coach, what will be your strategy against New York this Sunday? 
 (V.O.) ... The Palm patrons showed an impromptu appreciation tonight for the new Washington Redskins. They may be unknowns and far from superstars, but it sure looks like they have charmed the fans. 
 Hi.    Come in. 
 No. 
 We don't travel with the team. So, here's Tylenol with codeine, regular Vicodins, the magic bullet one that I gave you before, and a couple of Darvons if you actually break something. Pop 'em in the ambulance. 
 Wow.    Thanks. 
 I'll be watching on TV. The Giants got back three of their four defensive linemen. 
 Yeah.   I know. 
 What can I say? Go from the shotgun and scramble your ass off. 
 (in Shane's ear) Hello, again! 
 That's all-pro Hank Morris's third sack, his second here in the fourth quarter and the sixth of the day for 
 If he can stay alive that long. Ten-three New York in what has turned out to be an incredible defensive duel. 
 ... because it's about brothers, and brotherhood and standing together against the oppressors. That's why I am so grateful to our Teamster brothers who have joined us here today in New York to protest the greed squad known as the N.F.L. owners. 
 
 (to Reese Evans) You got to double up on Morris. 
 He's too far outside for me to get to him. (to Cochran) Bring him down and sit on him. 
 He's huge! He's been beating the crap out of me all day! I feel like a rag doll out here. 
 I'll help this time. 
 Okay. Spread left 'A' Right, roll right Half Back Sail. On two. 
 Red, fifteen.   Hut, hut! 
 
 
 Huddle up! 
 Same thing... Except... (to Lee and Cochran) Let him in. Don't touch him. 
 What? 
 Shane... 
 Shut up! Let him through. On two. 
 Red fifteen. Hut! 
 Get him! 
 (V.O.) Morris intercepts! Wait! The ball is stuck in his face! 
 MURRAY'S POV 
 (D.C.) 
 O'NEIL Now that's a hit! 
 Lee scores! Lee scores! Lee scores! I love to see a fat guy score! 
 
 
 
 
 
 (to Murray) What a hit! (slower) What a hit! 
 (to Murray) I'm proud of you, kid. 
 You're the one, you're the one, you're the one... 
 You think that's worth a shoe deal? 
 No! Danny, go down! You're using up the clock! 
 (to ref) Time out! 
 Beautiful tackle, Shane! 
 (V.O.) Now that's something you don't see everyday! 
 
 
 We got time for one play, but if we don't get it out of bounds, the game is over. 
 (smoking a butt) No problem. 
 Seriously? 
 (to Shane) You hold it. I'll kick it. 
 I can't believe it! McGinty is gonna let Pacifico try the field goal from sixty-five yards out! 
 Hey, John, this kid has got a heck of a foot. 
 But sixty-five yards? Come on! 
 
    (V.O.) Pat... did he    just? I think that guy    is smoking on the    field! 
 (V.O.) No, I think you imagined that one, John. 
 You look great, Lou, you know that? 
 Really? Thanks, Shane. That means a lot to me. 
 Hut! 
 
 (V.O.) It's straight enough! If it's got the distance, it's... 
 (V.O.) Good!     Redskins win! 
 Are you hurt? 
 No.     Not really. 
 You're getting used to being slapped around. That's a good sign. 
 I... 
 Would you like to come in and make love? 
 Yes. No. I'm here because ... I don't want to be alone. 
 Most    of the world feels that    way. You don't have    to be embarrassed about    it. 
 But to tell you the truth... I'm kind of scared of you. 
 I won't hurt you. 
 That shoulder is going to need special handling. 
 You know what hurts 
 I can't imagine. 
 Their defensive end punched me in the mouth. 
 Seriously. It's killing me. 
 ... after that game, after being beaten that badly in front of the whole country, after humiliating myself, my team, my school, my family, I mean -- did you know that I set two Sugar Bowl records?! I was sacked eleven times! I threw six interceptions! 
 Okay.   Calm down. 
 Anyway, after that, I could never seem to adjust in the pros. I was too scared. I lost my balls. 
 Well, they're back. 
 You know what I mean. My nerve. I lost the edge you need to play this game. 
 I don't believe that. I don't think it just goes away. It was only one bad day, Shane. Everybody has those. 
 No. Somehow, I convinced myself that I couldn't ever win the big game. I got so down, that I was afraid to be playing when a game was on the line. I was afraid to screw up. That's the sure sign of a loser. From there, it wasn't very far to thinking that I'll never win, that I didn't deserve to win at anything. Including love. 
 You're wrong. You're winning now. You're winning me. 
 
 
 (O.S.) ... the All Pro Miami Safety who was serving five to seven years in the Maryland state penitentiary for three counts of aggravated assault. As you may recall, one of those counts was against a Baltimore City police officer and resulted in that officer being hospitalized for quite some time. 
 Any idea how Wilkinson's identity was discovered and who leaked it to the media? 
 No, Bob, but rumor has it that the National Football League Player's Association had something to do with it. 
 Thanks, Hank. (TO CAMERA) In other N.F.L. news, almost sixty percent of the regular players have now crossed the picket lines and more are crossing every day. The strike, now in its second week, is expected to go out with a fizzle. Most experts think that the Monday night Dallas/Washington game will be the last with replacement players. But even that game will feature at least 75 percent of the regular Cowboys. Coach James McGinty will try to make it a perfect three and O with a team made up totally of replacement players. Well... and one felon. (pause) That we know of. 
 O'NEIL Where are we gonna keep him? 
 O'NEIL How did you pull that off? 
 O'NEIL (to Augustine) Take this cow piss out of here. 
 You used to love asparagus soup. They say that when the taste buds go, you're at the beginning of the end. 
 O'NEIL Let's keep 'em all. The hell with the regulars. 
 O'NEIL The hell I do! I'm dying! Let 'em sue me. 
 O'NEIL God damn 'em! Then you got to beat Dallas. The whole country will be watching. All those millionaires down there deserve to have their noses rubbed in it. 
 O'NEIL You can pull it    off. You proved that    winning doesn't have to    look pretty. These     boys are hungry for it,    Jimmy. (MORE) 
 O'NEIL (CONT'D) There's nothin' more dangerous in all of sports than a hungry team. I remember back in '47, we were playing Nebraska in the mud... 
 O'NEIL Okay, Jimmy, okay. But you beat Dallas for me, and then I'll go gently into that night. 
 You'll score, too, with a Cadillac from Coleman Cadillac. It's a big car for a big man. 
 (same thing) You'll score, too, with a Cadillac from Coleman's Cadillac. It's a big car for a big man. 
 (O.S.) That's good, Mickey, that's real good. Let's try it again. 
 
 C)   
 (in a monotone) You'll score, too, with a Cadillac from Coleman Cadillac. It's a big car, for a big man. 
 (O.S.) Okay. Good. That was good. Let's try it again... 
 (exploding) What?! I'm not doing it again! Who are you, Orson Welles?! This is nuts! 
 What's this? 
 This is a visit. 
 A visit. Who let you in? 
 I used to nail one of the housekeepers. 
 Lucky girl. 
 (pointing to the linemen) You know who these guys are, don't you? 
 Dallas Cowboys.     Howdy. 
 You'll be seeing a lot of these guys tomorrow. 
 What do you want? 
 Who, me? Not much. But these boys wanted a little head start on you. 
 I'm flattered that you actually think we have a chance to win. 
 It can be a game of luck. And under no circumstances can we allow a scab team to go three and O. Especially against the Dallas Cowboys. It's just not good for the 
 Is the union behind this 'visit'? 
 I can't really say, Shane. By the way, have you ever tried throwing a football with bruised ribs? 
 The pain makes it damn near impossible. 
 And one other thing: I want you to stay away from Annabelle. 
 The sad fact is she won't give me the time of day. But you can't have everything I want. I can't let that happen. So, you gotta stop seeing her. Just on principle. 
 Let me hear you say it. 
 Come on. You can do it. 
 (barely visible) I won't go out with her 
 Good. (to the linemen) Gentlemen? (to Shane) Hey, have a great game! 
 I think that Mister Matheson here, and myself, are very close to an agreement that will put the 'pro' back in pro-football. 
 Mister Matheson, what are the sticking points in the negotiations as far as the owners are concerned? 
 Only one: that the players immediately go back to work with no change in the existing contract. 
 Good evening from the Big O here in Washington D.C. where the mighty Dallas Cowboys take on the Cinderella Washington 'Scabskins' as they have come to be known. Hi, I'm Al Michaels and we are witnesses to a unique matchup tonight as Shane Falco and a contingent of strike players go up against the entire regular squad of the Dallas Cowboys. Yes, you heard right: every Cowboy has now crossed the picket line, some as late as this afternoon, and they will all play tonight. Can a rag tag group of hasbeens and castoffs stand up to what was once called America's team? And what about the strike itself? It has been so ineffective that many predict it will be over before this game ends. Stay tuned as Boomer and Dan join me for strike ball, D.C. style. 
 Whatever you say, Coach. 
 That    is one    very big leg    on Lou    Pacifico. He's    a big    reason why this    strike    team is two and    0. 
 But the fact is, a kicker does not an offense make. I think tonight the Scabskins will have a very rude awakening. 
 But you have to admit, Dan, Falco is proving to be the real thing. 
 Well, Boomer, no, I don't have to admit anything. 
 (rolling his eyes) Here we go... 
 
 Shane! 
 (to Butler) 
 No problem. 
 (O.S.) Hut!   Hut! 
 
 
 I'm gonna autograph your body with bruises, you scab-ass son of a bitch! 
 
 (grimacing) Like Christmas morning. 
 What pursuit! Butler never gave up on him. That's a 270-pound guy who moves like a halfback. 
 Dan, I think Butler's hit on Falco was late, to tell you the truth. 
 Well, of course you do. You were a wimp quarterback.

 Al, the battle is being fought and won in the trenches. You can't expect a bunch of pick- up players to stand up to a professional pass rush like the Cowboys. 
 There's still a whole half left, Dan. And remember, Falco is proving to be a second- half quarterback. 
 You got to be kidding. 
 Those big, fat boys in the trenches get awful tired. You ought to know that, Dan. 
 Okay, let's join Chris Berman with our half- time show. Chris? 
 (V.O.) Clear! 
 What's wrong with you guys?! 
 He started it. 
 I did not! You called me fat! 
 I did not! But you are! 
 Stop it! 
 I'm sorry, Roland. That was a great block. 
 For my last play in football, I'll take that block. 
 I thought you were going to score. What happened? Did you slip? 
 That's what I thought. 
 You were a warrior, Roland. I'm gonna miss you. 
 It was a dream come true. Go kick some ass for me. 
 Hey, Shane, I just heard. Congratulations! 
 Congratulations on what? 
 Shane is staying on. He's gonna be Martel's backup. 
 Is that true? 
 Yes, Andre. It's true. 
 I got to tell you, Shane, you played the first half like you were staying. Like you already had a contract. 
 You're right, Clifford. And I'm sorry. But now I want to go out there and either beat these bastards or die trying. I never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life. 
 I don't know what yawl are doin' tomorrow, but my ass is goin' back to jail. But if I gotta go, I want to go back a winner. 
 Hell, I'm retiring. I have thirty minutes of football left in my whole career. I'm homicidal! 
 Me, too, Reese! 
 Let's get it on! 
 Gentlemen, our problem is the Cowboys aren't afraid of us. But they should be! 
 Damn straight! 
 We've got one chance on offense to make our stand -- the first play of the half. 
 One touchdown ain't gonna help, Shane. 
 No.     But one nasty-ass play    might. We just gotta    be brave. And trust    each other. 
 Help me with this. 
 Somebody has to tape me up. 
 (V.O.) ... at nine-forty Eastern time, the agreement was reached, and except for this upcoming second half, the strike is history. 
 It's about time. I say let the professionals back on the field. The fans deserve nothing less. 
 Yeah, you would say that. 
 
 
 Are you okay? Is it your side? 
 I'm okay. I owe you an apology. 
 What?     You do? 
 Yes. I'll explain later. But thank you for believing in me. You give me strength just looking at you. 
 (V.O.) Well, this is a first. Shane Falco seems to be... 
 (V.O.) Hell,    Al, he's necking with    a cheerleader! I've    done a little of that    in my time. 
 (V.O.) The players are not supposed to fraternize with the cheerleaders. 
 (V.O.) Hey, Dan, what are they 
 
 That wasn't too smart. 
 Suck my dick. 
 
 (V.O.) Here we go, first and ten for the Redskins. Twenty-four zip Dallas. 
 Are you ready for more

 (V.O.) Unbelievable! One Washington player had a Cowboy in what appeared to be a police choke hold. 
 (V.O.) I see at least five flags... no six! 
 (to the Ref) He scratched my eyes out! 
 He hit me on purpose! 
 
 Unsportsmanlike conduct, number 72, number 81 and number 87 on the offense, fifteen yards... (to himself) ... times three... that's forty-five yards. Illegal use of hands, number 48 on the offense, fifteen yards. That makes it sixty yards. Unnecessary roughness number 65 and number 32, fifteen yards... that's, wait... forty-five... no, thirty... (turns to another ref) ... how many yards so far? 
 
 
 Okay, everybody, stick

 (V.O.) First and ten at the Cowboy twenty and I'm telling you, we are looking at a totally different team here in the second half. 
 (V.O.) Absolutely, Al. The Redskins are playing like there's no tomorrow, because, hey, there isn't! 
 (V.O.) I gotta agree with you on this one. The surprising thing for me is how ineffectual the Cowboys have been in this half. I mean, they look totally intimidated. 
 (V.O.) I love when you guys agree. 
 
 Hut!   Hut! 
 
 
 
 (V.O.) Touchdown, Skins!     What a fluke! 
 (V.O.) Total luck there, Al. Makes up for the perfect ones they drop. 
 (V.O.) Maybe not so lucky. Falco is down. 
 
 
 
 Put your tits on my head... 
 
 
 (V.O.) ... one minute twenty remaining, and even though Dallas didn't score, they sure ate up a lot of the clock. 
 (V.O.) And it looks like Falco cannot answer the bell. He's still on the bench 
 (V.O.) They just need to get the ball in field goal range. 
 (V.O.) And for Pacifico, that's anything up to sixty-five yards. 
 (V.O.) That's good for twelve yards. The clock stops on the first down. The Redskins have no time- outs left. 
 
 I can do it. 
 
 
 
 (V.O.) Wilkinson throws it away, and with twelve seconds remaining, the Redskins will try a forty-eight yard field goal to tie it up. That's almost a chip shot for Pacifico. 
 
 (to Shane) Are you okay? 
 Just make it a good snap. (to Pacifico) And you'll do the rest, right? 
 
 
 (to Pacifico) Lou, are you alright? 
 I'm sorry. They know where my family lives. 
 What?! 
 (through his legs) Come on, Shane! 
 Hut! 
 (V.O.) It's a fake! Falco has it! 
 
 (V.O.) Falco scores! 
 ON O'NEIL 
 
 
 (V.O.) 
 Clipping. Number 77 offense. 
 ON O'NEIL 
 
 I broke my arm. (big smile) Thank you. You saved my ass. 
 (to himself) What would Unitas do in this situation? (pause) I have no idea. 
 I'm so sorry, Shane. I'm sorry, everybody. 
 No problem, Mickey. (to Evans) Hell of a hit, Reese. 
 That's the one I was looking for. I can retire in peace now. 
 Right after this play. So besides me, who really wants the ball? 
 (to Murray) Yeah. You want it, Brian. Let's hook up. (signs as he says it) Blue left slot open 'A' right. Two Jet 'X' drive. On three. Gentlemen, it's been an honor sharing the field of battle. 
 
 Blue 58! Blue 58! Hut! Hut! Hut!

. 
 (excited) Smeagol, I've got one! (he laughs) I've got a fish, Smeagol! 
 (excitedly) Go on, pull it in. 
. 
 Give us that, Deagol, my love! 
 Why? 
 Because its my birthday, and I wants it. 
 V/0 They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they called us. They cursed us and drove us away. 
 (M캲E)                            (CONTINUED) 
 It's mine! My own. It came to me. 
 (ecstatic) My Precious. 
 Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once! 
 Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo? 
. 
 No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet. The days are growing darker. 
 Come on, must go, no time ... 
 Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat. 
 . . . no time to lose, silly. 
. 
 Here. 
 What about you? 
 (lying badly) I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas bread. 
 Sam. 
 (confessing) Alright. We don't have that much left. (MORE) 
 For what? 
 The journey home. 
 Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry! Shhh. 
. 
 I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon, after a hard days work. 
 Only, you've never done a hard days work. 
 
 You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on, and now we find you feasting and smoking. 
 (mouth full) We are sitting on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts. The salted pork is particularly good. 
 (suddenly interested) Salted pork? 
 (shaking his head) Hobbits! 
 We're under orders from Treebeard, who's taken over management of Isengard. 
 Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad you've come. Wood and water, stock and , stone I can master, but there's a wizard to be managed here ... Locked in his tower. 
 And there Saruman must remain, under your guard, Treebeard. 
 Let's just have his head and be done with it.                            . 
 (quietly) No. He has no power any more. 
 The filth of Saruman is washing away ... Trees will come back to live here, young trees . . . wild trees. 
 (urgent) Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad! 
 Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead! 
 Westu Aragorn hal. 
 I am happy for you. 
 (smiling) You are both honourable men. 
 It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory. 
 MERRY & PIPPIN (singing) Oh, you can search - up and down As many lands as can be found But you'll never find a beer so brown As the one we drink in our home town You can keep your fancy ales You can drink them by the flagon But the only brew, for the brave and true, Comes from the Green Dragon! 
 No news of Frodo? 
 No word ... nothing. 
 We till have time. 
 Do we know that? 
 (gently) What does your heart tell you? 
 (with a small smile) That Frodo is alive. (to himself) Yes - yes, he is alive. 
 Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them ... kill them both! 
 (CON TINUED ) 
 (hissed whisper) Shhh! Quiet! 
 They knows, they knows, they suspects us. 
. 
.,               .     ,. What is it saying,.my Precious, my love? Is . Smeagol losing his nerve?? 
                 : No! Not! Never!! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see: them - dead! 
 And we will . . ,- Smeagol did it once. . . (sly) . . . He can do it again. 
 We must get the Precious. We must get it back. 
 Patience, patience, my love. First we must lead them to her. 
 We lead them to the windy stairs. 
 (prompting) Yes, the stairs ... and then? 
 Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until we come to . . . (naughty excitement) ... the Tunnel! 
 (quiet) And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry, she always needs to feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy Orcses. 
 And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, Precious?               . 
 (sinister) No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats . . . 
 And take it for Me! (CONTINUED) 
 (correcting) For us . . . 
 Yes, we, we meant for us . . . (choking cough) Go Hum! Go Hum! 
 (sly) The Precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead! 
 (yelling)            ,     . You treacherous little toad! 
 (crying) No! Not! Help! Master! 
. 
 No, Sam! Leave him alone! 
 (fuming) I heard it from his own mouth        he means to murder us! 
 Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies! 
. 
 You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in! 
 Sm. . . a 
 Call me a liar! You're a liar! 
 Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost. 
 I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I won' t wait around for him to kill us ! 
 (fierce whisper) I'm not sending him away. 
 You don't see it, do you? He's a villain! 
 (lowers voice) We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side. 
 (taken aback) I'm on your side, Mr Frodo. 
 I know, Sam, I know. (whisper) You must trust me. 
 The stars are veiled, something stirs in the east . . . A sleepless malice. 
 . . . 
 (whispers) What you doing? (CONTINUED) 
 I just want to look at it. Just one more time. 
 Put it back! Put - it - back! 
. 
 (urgent) He is here. 
 Help! Someone help him! 
 Fool of a Took! 
 Pippin! 
 Gandalf! Forgive me. 
             . Look at me! What did you see? 
 (disjointed) A tree ... There was a white tree . . . in a courtyard of stone . . . It was dead! 
 Minas Tirith??? (to PIPPIN) Is that what you saw? 
 (terrified) I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his voice in my head. 
 And what did you tell him? Speak! 
 He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he hurt me . . . 
 . . . 
 What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring? 
 There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. 
 (quietly) Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? 
 (low and urgent) I will go. 
 (hurried) No! 
 They must be warned. 
 They will be. (low voice, to Aragorn) You must come to Minas Tirith by another ra ... od (cryptic) Follow the river, look to the black ships. (louder, to all) Understand this . . . things are now in motion that cannot be undone. 
. 
 Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin, Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry! 
 (worried) Where are we going? 
 Why did you look - why do you always have to look? 
                                 . (subdued) I don't know . . . I can't help it. 
 You never can. 
 (lightly)                . . . . ,.;       I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it again. 
 Don't you understand ... the Enemy thinks you have the Ring . . . he's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here! 
 And you. You're coming with me . . . Merry? 
 Come on! 
 (nervous) How far is Minas Tirith? 
 Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and you'd better hope we don't have one of those on our tail. 
 Here - something for the road. 
 The last of the Longbottom Leaf. 
 I know you've run out . . . you smoke too much, Pip. 
 But we'11 see each other soon? 
 I don't know . . . I don't know what's going to happen. 
 (rising panic) Merry? (CONTINUED) 
 Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of haste. 
 (panicked) Merry! 
 V/0 Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the Sea . . . The last journey of Arwen Undomiel. 
. 
 O.S. Lady Arwen? 
 We cannot delay. 
 (C O N TI N U ED ) 
                            .... What did you see? 
 Arwen? 
 You have the gift of foresight - tell me what you have seen. 
 I looked into your future and I saw death. 
 There is also life.                           , 
 (quietly) That future is almost gone. 
 But it is not lost ... 
 Nothing is certain. 
 Some things are certain. If I leave him now I will regret It forever. (whisper) Ada, it is time. 
 V/0 Reforge the sword. 
 Ada ... 
 Your hands are cold. (distressed) The life of the Eldar is leaving you. 
 This was my choice. Ada ... Whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence. 
 We have just passed into the realm of Condor! 
 Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings. 
. (CONTINUED) 
                             ; . (whisper) It's the tree.           , (hurrying after GANDALF) Gandalf! Gandalf! 
 Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. 
. 
 Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor. 
 (bitter) Perhaps you come to explain this? 
 .. Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and me . . . he fell, defending us from many foes. 
 (hurried whisper) Pippin! 
 I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt. 
 (to PIPPIN) Get up! (a ddre ssin g D ENET HOR) My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Condor's armies? 
 (softly) You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. 
 (stung) Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King - Steward! 
 (explosive) The rule of Condor is mine, and no others! 
 Come. 
 So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial position . . . I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting . . . do they? 
 You're in the service of the Steward now - you're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took . . . (under his breath) Guard of the Citadel! 
 It's so quiet. 
 It's the deep breath before the plunge. 
 I don't want to be in a battle . . . but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.                                L (tense)                                  : Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and Sam? 
 There never was much hope. 
 V/0 (grim) Our enemy is almost ready, his full strength gathered. Not only Ores, but men as well. 
 This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammerstroke will fall hardest. 
 V/0 If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this city will be gone. 
 But we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something. 
 V/0 Sauron    has yet to reveal his deadliest servant    . . . The one who will lead Mordor's armies    in war, the one they say no living man can    kill. 
 The Witchking of Angmar . . . (he looks down at a startled 
)         ,           . ; You've met him before . . . 
 V/0 And Minas Morgul is his lair. 
 (whisper) The Dead City, very nasty place, full of ... enemies. 
 (CO NTINUE D) 
 No, Mr Frodo! 
 (desperate) Not that way! 
 No! 
 (disorientated) They're calling me! 
 Hide! Hide! 
 . (gasping) I can feel his blade! 
! 
 (quiet) We come to it at last ... the great battle of our time. 
 V/0 This war is long planned. Sauron has hated the west through many ages . . . It is a hatred that flows from the depths of time, across the deeps of the Sea. 
 (urgent) Come, hobbits. We climb - we must climb! 
 (to himself) The board is set, the pieces are moving. 
 Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth! 
. 
 (to his oarsmen) Quiet! 
 (urgent) To the river - quick! 
 Faster! 
 Draw swords! 
! 
 (to himself) Amon Din ... come on . . . 
 (yelling) The beacon! The beacon at Amon Din is lit! 
 (to himself) Hope is kindled. 
 The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Condor calls for aid! 
 Then Rohan will answer. Muster the Rohirrim! 
 Assemble the army at Dunharrow - as many men as can be found. You have two days ... On the third, we ride for Condor ... and war! 
 You ride with us? 
 Just to the encampment. It's tradition for the women of the Court to farewell the men. (CONTINUED) 
 V/0 So . . . It is before the walls of Minas Tirith that the doom of our time will be decided. 
 . . . 
 Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan - oaths you have taken. Now, fulfil them all - to Lord and land! 
 We can't hold them. The city is lost! 
 Tell the men to break up. We ride for Minas Tirith. 
 ... 
 Nazgul! 
 Take cover! 
 The age of men is over. The time of the Ore has come. 
 Open the Gates! Pull! (CONTINUED) 
. 
 Mithrandir! 
 ... 
 It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long has he foreseen this doom! 
 Foreseen and done nothing! 
 No. 
 (disbelief) You've seen Frodo and Sam? 
. 
 Where? When? 
 In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf - they are taking the road to the Morgul Vale. 
 (shocked realisation) . . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol. 
 What does that mean? What's wrong? 
 (urgent) Faramir . . . Tell me everything. 
 Careful, Master - careful! Very far to fall. Very dangerous on the stairs. 
. 
 Come, Master. 
. 
 (alarmed yell) Mr Frodo! 
 Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master? 
 (clinical) Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all. 
 What of the Wizard? 
 I shall break him. 
 1 (worried) Where are Theoden's riders? 
 2 Will Rohan's army come? 
 1 Mithrandir? 
 (nervous) Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me. 
 And I shall not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given ... 
' S. 
 What would you have me do? 
 I will not yield the River and Pelennor unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken. 
 My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun. 
 Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his Lord's will? 
 (quietly) You wish now that our places had been exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had lived? 
 (coldly) Yes, I wish that. 
 Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead. 
 That will depend on the manner of your return. 
 What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we? 
 (prevaricating) Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh yes, my Precious, very nice. 
 Alright, alright - you just startled me is all. (peering over the cliff's edge) What were you doing? 
 (sly) Sneaking! 
 Fine, have it your own way. 
                              . It's dark still. 
 It's always dark here - 
 (alarmed) What? That's all we have left! 
 (dawning realisation) He took it! He must have! 
 (shocked) Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread! 
 You're a lying wretch! What did you do with it? 
 He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken it. 
 What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses! (fake outrage) He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's always stuffing himself when Master's not looking! 
 (angry) That's a filthy lie! 
 (yelling) Sam! Stop it! 
 (yelling) I'll kill him! I'll kill him! 
 No, Sam! 
 Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to go so far, I was so angry . . . Here, let's rest up a bit. 
 (exhausted) I ' m alright. 
 No, no, you're not alright! You're exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this place; it's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a while - share the load. 
 Get away! 
 (confused) I don't want to keep it . . . I just want to help! 
 See! See! He wants it for himself. 
 (beside himself) Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here. 
 (quietly) No, Sam . . . it's you. 
 (hopelessly) But . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you against me. 
 You can't help me anymore. 
 You don't mean that. 
 (eerie calm) Go home. 
. 
 Faramir! Your father's will has turned to madness! Do not throw away your life so rashly! 
 (deadened) Where does my allegiance lie if not here? 
 Your father loves you, Faramir! (quietly) And will remember it before the end. 
. 
 Can you sing, Master Hobbit? 
 (uneasy) Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my own people ... but we have no songs for great halls and evil times . . . we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain. 
 And why should your songs be unfit for my halls, or for hours such as these. Come - sing me a song! 
 V/0 Home is behind, the world ahead, And there are many paths to tread. Through shadow to the edge of night Until the stars are all alight. Mist and shadow, cloud and shade: All shall fade, all shall fade. 
. 
. 
. (CONTINUED) 
 ... 
 Grimbold, how many? 
 I bring five hundred men from the Westfold, my Lord. 
 (0.S.) We have three hundred more from Fenmarch, Theoden, King. 
 (quietly) Where are the riders from Snowbourne? 
. 
 (quietly) Six thousand spears . . . less than half of what I had hoped for . . . 
 Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor. 
 More will come. 
                 ; Every hour lost hastens Condor's defeat. We have till dawn. Then we must ride. 
 (uneasy) The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;. quiet ..? 
 They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain . . . 
 That road there - where does that lead? 
 It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door under the mountain. 
 None who venture there ever return. (under his breath) That mountain is evil . . . 
 O.S Aragorn! 
 Let's find some food. 
. 
 There! A true Esquire of Rohan. 
 Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous. (despondent) It isn't even sharp. 
 Well, that's no good. You won't kill many Ores with a blunt blade. Come on. 
 To the Smithy .- go! 
 You should not encourage him. 
 And you should not doubt him. 
 I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach of his arm. 
 Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you. (to herself) Why can he not fight for those he loves? 
 V/0 Look to the Black Ships . . . 
 V/0 I choose a mortal life . . . I wish I could have seen him, one last time ... 
 King Theoden awaits you, my Lord. 
 I take my leave. 
 My Lord, Elrond. 
 I come on behalf of one whom I love. 
 She stayed? 
 She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. 
 It will not be our end, but his. 
 You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith - this you know - but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river . . . 
 There are none. 
 (quietly) There are those who dwell in the mountain. 
 Murderers, traitors - you would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no-one. 
 They will answer to the King of Condor. 
 Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil . . . 
 The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. 
 (ELVISH: with subtitles) U-chebin estel anim. I keep none for myself. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Eowyn . . . 
  We need you here -                    , (CONTINUED) 
 Why have you come? 
 (hesitant) Do you not know? 
 (gentle) It is but a shadow and a thought that you love . . . I cannot give you what you seek. 
 And just where do you think you're off to? 
 Not this time ... This time you must stay, my friend. 
 O.S Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves? 
 You might as well accept it - we're going with you, laddie. 
 O.S. Why does he leave on the eve of battle? 
 He leaves because he must. 
 No, we cannot . . . (surveying his frightened Men) But we will meet them in battle, nonetheless. 
 (gentle) I have left instruction: the people are to follow your rule in my stead ... take up my seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill. 
 What other duty would you have me do, my Lord? 
 (quiet) Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again - not grieve for those whose time has come. 
 What kind of an army would linger in such a place? 
 One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to the last King of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight, but when the time came, when Condor's need was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur cursed them - never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge. 
.                                     ' 
 (terrified whisper) The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away. 
 (translating) The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is shut. 
 Brego! 
. 
 Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf will go underground when a Dwarf dare not. (gritting his teeth) Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it! 
 We must ride light and swift. It's a long road ahead ... and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. 
 All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind! 
 It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith. None of my Riders can bear you as a burden. 
 But . . . I want to fight! 
 I will say no more. 
. 
! 
 (grimly) Ride with me. 
 My Lady! 
 (shouting above the din) Move out - move out! 
 Ride! Ride now, for Gondor! 
. 
 HUGE, CAVERN . . . 
 One who will have your allegiance. 
 You will suffer me! 
... 
 
. 
 (desperate) I summon you to fulfil your oath! 
. 
 It has been remade! 
. 
. 
. 
 Aghh! Your wasting your time, Aragprn. They had no honour in life, they have none now in death. 
 (yelling) I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oath fulfilled. What say you? 
 . . . 
 (yelling) Open the gate! Quick! 
 (shocked) Lord Faramir! 
 ... 
 Faramir! 
 They were outnumbered, none survived. 
 Fear! The city is rank with it. Let us ease their pain. Release the prisoners! 
 Catapults! 
! 
 My son is dead. My line is ended. 
 (touching Faramir's forehead) He's alive! 
 The House of Stewards has failed! . . . 
 (urgently)                                ; He needs medicine, my Lord! 
 My line has ended. 
 (urgently) My Lord! 
 . . . 
 (rasping whisper) Rohan has deserted us! 
. 
 SUDDENLY: THWACK! 
 (yell) Prepare for battle!! 
 (yelling) Return to your posts! 
 (angry yell) Send these foul beasts into the abyss! 
 Stay where you are! 
! 
 (rallying) Stand to your posts! Do not give in to fear. Fight! 
 (stupor) They called us out to fight . . . 
 (urgency) This is no place for a Hobbit! 
 ... 
 Grond! Grond! Grond! 
"'! 
 (exhausted) What is this place? 
 Master must go inside the tunnel. 
 Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to. 
 It's the only way. (GOLLUM;- slyly) Go in - or go back. 
 (under his breath) I can't go back. 
 What's that smell? 
 (lying) Orcses filth! Orcses come in here sometimes. 
 O.S.. (disembodied) Hurry! 
 Smeagol! 
 O.S. (disembodied) Over here. 
 It's sticky . . . What is it? 
 O.S. You will see . . . Oh, yes . . . You will see. 
! 
 (nervous) Smeagol! Smeagol! 
 V/0 I give you the light of Earendil - our most beloved star. May it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out. 
 (stronger) Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima! 
! 
 O.S. (sing-song) Naughty little fly, Why does it cry? 
 Caught in a web Soon you'll be . . . . ?. Eaten! 
 Got away did it, Precious? Not this time, not this time! 
 (pleading) It wasn't us! It wasn't us! Smeagol wouldn't hurt Master. 
. 
. 
 (shaky) I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I have to destroy it for both our sakes. 
 I'm so sorry, Sam . . . 
 . . . A 
 V/0 This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a way ... no- one will. 
 A! 
 To the Gates! Man the Gates! 
 (whisper) No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long slow sleep of death embalmed . . . we shall burn - like the heathen kings of old! 
 B . . . L                          . 
 (commanding) Steady! Steady! 
! 
 Let him go, you filth! 
! 
 What's this? Looks like Old Shelob's been having a bit of fun! 
 Killed another one, has she? 
 No . . . this fellow ain't dead. 
 (to himself) Not dead! 
 (excited). She jabs them with her stinger and they go as limp as a boned fish. Then she has her way with them. That's how she likes to feed - fresh blood. (yelling) Get him to the Tower! 
 Samwise, you fool! 
 2 This fellow will be awake in a few hours. 
 Then he'll wish he'd never been born. 
 The house of his spirit crumbles! He is burning ... already burning.                    7 
 FARAMIR'S BODY. 
! (CONTINUED) 
 (yelling) He's not dead! He's not dead! 
 (menacing) Farewell Peregrin, son of Paladin . . . I release you from my service ... 
 O.S (ordering) Pour oil on the wood! 
 (yelling) Gandalf? ... Gandalf? 
 Pull back - to the second level! Hurry! Get the women and children out of here - get them out! (CONTINUED) 
 Move into the city ... Kill all in your path. 
 Fight! Fight for your lives! 
 (whisper) Courage, Merry ... courage for our friends 
 Form ranks you maggots! Form ranks! Pikes in front, lances behind. 
 (urgent yells) Eomer! Take your Eored down the left flank . . . Gamling! Follow the King's banner down the centre. Grimbold, take your company right after we pass the wall. Forth and fear no darkness! 
 (terrified) Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you. 
 (stirring call) Ride now, ride now, ride, ride for ruin and the world's ending! 
 (6000 voices) Death!                               ... .. 
 Death!

 (panicked yell) Gandalf! 
 Come! Quickly! 
                        ,- Set a fire in our flesh! 
 (yelling) Stay this madness! 
! 
 No! Do not take my son from me! 
 (grimly) So passes Denethor, Son of Ecthelion. 
 Drive them into the river! 
                              . (yelling) Make safe the city!

! 
 (quiet) I didn't think it would end this way . . . 
 (gently) End? No, the journey doesn't end here. 
 What, Gandalf? See what? 
 White shores ... And beyond . . . A far green country under a swift sunrise. 
 (quiet) Well, that isn't so bad. 
 (gently) No . . . No, it isn't. 
! 
 . . . 
 (yelling) Rally to me! To me! 
 WITCH-KING Feast on his flesh! 
! 
 I will kill you if you touch him! 
 WITCH-KING Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey! 
! 
 (angry) Late as usual! Get off your ships, you sea rats! There's knife work here needs doing. 
  렁 Plenty for the both of us . . . May the best dwarf win! .                                               (CONTINUED) ; 
 No man can kill me . . . Die! 
 I am no man! 
 That still only counts as one! 
 (gasping weakly) I know your face ... Eowyn ... 
 No . . . I am going to save you ... 
 (loving) You already did . . . (clutching her hand) My body is broken ... you have to let me go 
 N ... o 
 I go to my fathers . . . in whose mighty company, I shall not now feel ashamed ... (CONTINUED) 
! 
 ... 
 (quietly) Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, these lads - despite the fact, they're dead! 
 I hold your oath fulfilled . . . Go. Be at peace. 
 Merry ...? 
 (groggy) I knew you'd find me. (disorientated) Are you going to leave me? 
 No Merry, I'm going to look after you. 
 Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's mine. 
 It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else . . . 
 I don't take orders from stinking Morgul rats! 
 (angry yell) You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your guts! 
 (yelling) The scum tried to knife me! Kill him! 1                                (CONTINUED) 
 (yelling . . . 1st URUK-HAI)              , That's for Frodo! (yelling ... 2nd URUK-HAI) And for the Shire! (yelling . . . 3rd URUK-HAI) And that's for my old Gaffer!                 runs into the TOWER . . . 
. 
 Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat! 
! 
 Not if I stick you first! 
 (joyous disbelief) Sam!!! 
 Come on. 
 (despairing) It's too late. It's over . . . they've taken it. Sam - they took the Ring!! 
 (quietly) Begging your pardon, but they haven't. 
 ... 
 
 Give it to me. 
 Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some clothes . . . you can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin. 
 We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor. 
 There are so many of them . . . So many. We'll never get through unseen. 
 We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters. 
 Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening. 
 If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it. 
 It's only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping. 
 Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should we care? 
 Because ten thousand Ores now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 No. 
 How? 
 Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate. 
 We cannot achieve victory from strength of arms . 
 Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves . 
 A diversion . . . 
 (doubtful) Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait! 
 Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for? 
. 
. 
 Look, the Ores! They're moving off. You see, Mr Frodo - some luck at last. 
. 
 Take mine . . . there's a few drops left. 
 There'll be none left for the return journey. 
 (softly) I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr Frodo. 
 Fo o g td w rd , e on 
 (wary) Where are they? 
 Let the lord of the Black Land come forth; let justice be done upon him. 
 Pull back! Pull back! 
 It's gone, Mr Frodo. 
. 
 Hold your ground - hold your ground! Sons of Gondor - of Rohan . . . my brothers! 
 Never thought I ' d die fighting side by side with an Elf. 
 (quietly) What about side by side with a friend? 
 Aye - I could do that. 
 (softly) Do you remember the Shire, Mr Frodo? . . . It'll be spring soon, and the orchards will be in blossom; and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket; and they'11 be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields; and eating the first of the strawberries with cream. (looking down at FRODO) Do you remember the taste of strawberries? 
 (weak whisper) No, Sam. I can't recall    the taste of food; nor the sound of water;     nor the touch of grass . . . I'm naked in   the dark. (rising panic) There's no veil between    me and the wheel of fire. I can see it with    my waking eyes. (CONTINUED) 
 Then let us be rid of it - once and for all! Come on, Mr Frodo. I can't carry it for you ... but I can carry you! Come on! 
 ... 
 (softly) For Frodo . . . 
! 
 (growing excitement) Look, Mr Frodo! We're almost there!       -.-. 
 Clever Hobbits to climb so high! 
 (yelling desperately) Frodo! 
 (disbelieving) Eagles . . . 
 (yelling) Frodo! 
 ... 
 I'm here, Sam. 
 (yelling) Destroy it - go on! Throw it in the fire! 
. 
 The Ring is mine. 
 No!        : 
! 
 GOLLUM'S WEIGHT! 
 . . . 
 Precious! Precious! 
 ... POWERFUL ... EVIL . . . 
! 
 Give me your hand. 
                    .          .. It's gone . . . it's done. 
 Yes, Mr. Frodo ... it's over now. 
.                                                     ,' . 
 (remembering) I can see the Shire ... The Brandywine River, Bag End, Gandalf's fireworks . . . the lights in the Party Tree . . . (CONTINUED) 
 Rosie Cotton dancing ... she had ribbons in her hair . . . (sobs) . . . if ever I was to marry someone . . . it would have been her . . . it would have been her. 
 (calm) I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee . . . here at the end of all things. 
. 
 Gandalf? 
!                                                      ; 
 . . . 
 Now come the days of the King ... 
 This day does not belong to one man but to all. Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace. 
 . . . 
 V/0 And thus it was a Fourth Age of     Middle- earth began, and the Fellowship     of the Ring, though eternally bound by     friendship and love, was ended. Thirteen months to the day since    Gandalf      ,. sent us on our long journey . . . 
 V/0 . . . we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight . . . We were home! 
 V/0 How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in your heart you begin to understand. There is no going back. There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep. That have taken hold. 
 O.S Mr Frodo? 
                 . (concerned)                       - What is it?                - 
 It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed. 
.                               .....' 
                         ,           " (reading) "There and Back Again . . . A      Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins". 
 (closing the book) Not quite . . . There's room for a little more. 
 V/0 Bilbo once told me, the great stories never end - that each of us must come and go in the telling. His part in this tale was now over. There would be no more journeys for Bilbo. Save one. 
. 
 O.S. (frail) Tell me again, lad. Where are we going? 
 O.S. To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have accorded you a special honour. A place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth. 
 (frail) Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old ring of mine ... the one I gave you? 
 (quietly) Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it. 
 (frail) Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it one last time.                                    
 Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never톝een before. 
. 
. 
 The power of the Three Rings is ended. The time has come for the Dominion of Men. 
 (ELVISH: with subtitles) I Aear can ven na mar. 
 I think I'm quite ready for another adventure. 
 Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship. 
 (alarmed) What does he mean? 
 (gently) We set out to save the Shire, and it has been saved ... but not for me . . . 
 (shaken) You don't mean that - you can't leave. 
 The last pages are for you, Sam. 
 Elanor! 
 V/0 My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in two. You have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much enjoy and to be and to do. Because Sam, your part in the journey goes on.

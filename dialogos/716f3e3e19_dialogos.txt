 How about it, Jeff? 
 Done. 
 
 (O.S.) Nice legs. 
 (matter-of-fact) Sniper. 
 Where? 
 High-rise. Top floor.        Window in the middle. 
 (looking through his binoculars) Stay on him. Stay on him.        Now go back to the woman. Now! 
 (O.S.) Back to the sniper. 
 Stay tight on the sniper. Jesus -- look at him! He's about fourteen! Don't lose this! 
 He sees her. 
 Stay on her. If she runs, widen and try to get her and sniper in the same frame. 
 I said he sees her. 
 I heard you.    Stay on her. 
 (under his breath) No... no... 
 Sniper!   Sniper! Sni-- 
 
-47. 
 
 
 
 
 God, I missed you. 
 Me too. 
 Let's get out of here. Where's your equipment? Don't tell me you checked it? 
 (holds up his bag) This is it. 
 No camera? 
 No nothing? 
 Ah ha. 
 
 Jeff? 
 Can I come in? 
 (O.S.) Sure. 
 Couldn't sleep? 
 I remember when you took that. We had fun on that trip, didn't we? 
 You want to talk about it? 
 There's nothing to talk about. 
 C'mon, Jeff. 
 I told you. I quit.   Walked out. end of story. 
 That's   it? 
 Whatever happened back there wasn't your responsibility. You can't keep beating yourself up over it. 
 What do you think? You could have stopped that girl from getting killed? 
 You don't understand... 
 It was different this time. 
 I talked to Reynolds. (a beat) He thinks I could still get the job at the San Diego station. 
 Oh, Jeff, you didn't... 
 Think of it. Low pressure, a steady paycheck. So I shoot city council meetings -- how bad could it be? 
 Is that what you really want -- or are you just running away? 
 Who's running? It's good money, full benefits. I'm tired of freelance. We could finally put some money in the bank. 
 You know I'll never stand in your way. But you've worked so hard. Are you sure you want to throw it away? 
 Throw what away? Don't you get it? I don't do anything. I sit, I watch, I film -- I let it happen. 
 You're supposed to let it happen. It's your job. 
 No, Amy.   It's my excuse. 
 That girl... it's like I was paralyzed. I wanted to do something, but I didn't. I just stood there and watched her get killed. 
 Please, babe, I need this.     Say yes and we'll take as long    as you want -- drive cross-country    and make a vacation out of it.     What do you say? 
 Jesus, Jeff... 
 Sorry.     I took my eyes off the road. 
 (seeing thermos on floor) Maybe it's time we took a break, you know? 
 I'll pull over next chance we get. (a beat) Sorry... 
 On vacation? 
 Sort of.    We're moving, actually. 
 Whereabouts? 
 California. We thought we'd take the scenic route. 
 Huh. In that case, you oughta try the Pass Road, 'bout thirty miles west. Real pretty, makes a loop through the hills, then hooks back up with the highway. 
 Thanks. I'll mention it to my husband. 
 Okay, then. Good luck.   Enjoy the rest of your trip. 
 (flatly) Nice car. 
 Thanks. 
 Air, C.D., leather -- I guess you sprung for the whole nine yards. 
 I guess. 
 Then again, out here, what you really need's a C.B. radio. 
 Is that right? 
 'Course, if you use a C.B., you gotta have a handle. 
 How about Shit-for-Brains? (beat) You damn near killed us back there, boy. 
 Look, I'm sorry, I didn't see you. You pulled out in front of me. 
 The hell I did. I saw what happened. 
 How about if we just forget it, okay? I'm sorry it happened. I don't want any trouble. 
 (snorting) Yeah.     I bet you don't. 
 Howdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow tryin' to steal your Cherokee. 
 What was that about? 
 Nothing. Guy in the truck. Thinks I tried to hit him. 
 C'mon, let's go. 
 You want me to drive? 
 Later.   Just get in. 
 Is something wrong? 
 No, let's just go. 
 
 This isn't the Grand Prix, you know. 
 What's bothering you? 
 I told you. Nothing. (pause) The guy was an asshole. 
 What'd you get? 
 Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe they still make this stuff? 
 You kidding. It's probably gourmet cuisine around here. 
 (trying to brighten the mood) This is crazy. Look at this. Says if you win this mail-in contest, you can choose either ninety thousand dollars or ninety thousand doughnuts. 
 What would you do with ninety thousand doughnuts? 
 I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty cents each and pay off this car. 
 Very funny. (beat) Alright, what about ninety thousand dollars? What would you do with that? 
 I don't know.    Look, Amy, I'm not -- 
 Sonofabitch!! My camera!        He stole my camera! 
 (startled) Who? 
 The redneck at the gas station! He lifted it right under my nose! My brand new Nikon. (pounds wheel in frustration) Goddammit. 
 Should we go back? 
 What's the use. He's probably halfway to Bumblefuck now, the bastard. 
 Look, maybe if we call the cops -- 
 What the hell? 
 What'd you do? 
 Nothing.   I -- 
 Hang on -- I can't steer! 
 (deadpan) Found your camera. 
 Ow! 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 (annoyed) I said I'm fine, okay? 
 Out of range? 
 What's going on, Jeff? 
 What's it look like?      I'm trying to fix the car. 
 Not the car. 
 What? 
 What's going on with you? 
 It's been a month since you got back. You can't keep shutting me out like this. 
 Jeff, I'm talking to you. 
 (flaring) Look, I really don't want to go into this right now. I'm changing jobs, our finances are fucked, and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. So could we maybe just fix the -- 
 Christ, not these guys... 
 Asshole... 
 (looking down the road) Jeff -- 
 What the hell? 
 What's he doing? 
 I don't know. 
 
 
 RED (TRUCKER) You folks all right? 
 Yeah.   Our car broke down. 
 Thanks, I'd appreciate it.    Amy, you want to steer? 
 Think you could radio a tow truck for us? 
 How far is that? 
 (disappointed) Oh. 
 It's a new car. 
 Nice     of you to offer. But we've got a     lot of stuff in the car. I think     we're better off waiting for a cop     to come along. 
 Are you nuts? 
 We don't know this guy. 
 He's offering to help. It       could be hours before anyone else      comes along. It's 100 degrees.        You really want to be stuck out      here? 
 Amy, I've got my equipment in the car. All our stuff. What if those guys come back and we're not here? (turns away, quietly to himself) Jesus... don't be stupid... 
 Stupid is sitting out here waiting for a cop when we already have a ride. 
 Stupid was letting you talk me into leaving Boston. 
 Excuse me? Do you think you could drop me at that diner? 
 That's okay. My husband wants to stay with the car. I'll just get my purse. 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 I'm going to the diner. I'm going to call a tow truck. Then I'm going to order an iced tea and wait. Good-bye, Jeff. 
 (firm) You're not riding with that guy. End of story. 
 You wanted to be alone. Well... you're alone. Why don't you take the time to get your head together? 
 Oh for Christ's sake... 
 Excuse me. 
 I was supposed to meet my wife here. 
 Dark hair, slender, about five- five. Wearing a pale blue Benetton shirt. 
 A pale blue what? 
 Benetton shirt. 
 Hank!  Your order's ready. (to Jeff) I been busy. They come and go. 
 It would've been within the last half hour. She might've been with a trucker? 
 A trucker. 
 Guy with a baseball cap.   Driving an eighteen wheeler. 
 Don't ring a bell. 
 You sure? 
 Hey! Man here's looking for his wife, dark hair, button-on shirt, travelin' with a guy in a baseball cap. Anybody see 'em? 
 Looks like she got away from ya, cowboy. 
 Could she have left a message with another one of your employees? 
 Don't see how. I'm the only one who works here. 
 I don't understand. Is there another Belle's Diner? 
 (chuckles) No siree. Definitely not. 
 (under his breath) Shit. 
 Excuse me, how far is the next town? 
 About twenty miles. 
 Look, if my wife comes in -- her name is Amy -- tell her I was here. Tell her to stay put till I get back, not to move. Would you do that, please? 
 (shrugs, bored) Okay. 
 
 C'mon, you fat-ass.    Pull over. 
 Pull over!    Pull over! 
 
 
 
 I was signaling you to stop. Didn't you see me? 
 Where's my wife? 
 My wife.     Where is she? 
 I checked at the diner.      No one saw her there. 
 You gave her a ride. You were supposed to drop her at Belle's diner. 
 How can you not remember? It was just half an hour ago, for chrissakes! 
 (V.O.) (filtered) Breaker, breaker -- Iron Man, you copy? 
 (reacts) Your radio works -- (locks eyes with Red) What the hell are you doing -- ? 
 Amy?    Amy?!   You in there? 
 I want my fucking wife, is what I want! What have you done to her?! 
 Officer, I need your help! 
 What's your problem? 
 I don't know, this guy has my wife! 
 Calm down, sir. Tell me what's going on. 
 I don't know what the hell's going on. Last time I saw her she was with this guy in his truck. Now he's saying he's never seen her! 
 Don't lie, you son of a bitch! 
 All right -- everybody just calm down. (to Jeff) Sir, you want to tell me what happened? 
 Our car broke down. This guy stopped to help us, said he'd drive my wife to a pay phone.    But she never showed up. 
 (turning to Red) Sir? 
 And you didn't give his wife a ride? 
 He's lying! 
 Sir, all right with you if I search your truck? 
 That won't be necessary yet. Just stand back behind the line. Both of you. 
 (to both of them) All right, let's see your license and registration. 
 What are you hauling today, Mr. Barr? 
 (eyeing him) Long way to go empty. 
 (to Sheriff, impatient) Are we gonna keep looking or what? 
 Yes, we are. (to Red) Sir, I'm gonna have to see everything. 
 (re: boxes) Those yours? 
 No. I think we're pretty much done here. You're free to go. 
 (reacts) Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec. That's it? You're not going to question him anymore? 
 Sir, I searched the truck. There's no evidence of suspicious activity, no sign of struggle. 
 (lunges) Go to hell, you sonofabitch -- 
 Hey! Hey! You want to get arrested? Now the man has a point. This is a plain-looking, John Doe truck. Maybe you did get them mixed up. 
 Hey! 
 Mr. Taylor, either you come down from there or I'm going to have to arrest you. 
 It was him.    It was this truck. 
 Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you get a license plate? 
 No. 
 What about the information on the door panel. You recall any of that? 
 I wasn't paying attention. 
 Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance have a beef with your wife today? 
 What does that have to do with anything? 
 Well, for starters, maybe she left you. 
 I don't believe this... 
 I've seen it a hundred times. Lovers, married couples, gay guys. You put two people in a car long enough, they'll go at it. Hell, I've even seen men dump their women on the side of the road, and vice versa. 
 My wife did not leave me. 
 I understand. Go ahead, sir.         I appreciate your cooperation. 
 This is insane. You're just going to let him go? 
 I've got his information. If we need to find him later, we'll know where to look. 
 Sir, I believe you that your wife is missing. Maybe you got confused about what truck she got into, maybe you had a fight -- you don't have to tell me. The point is I'm trying to help. 
 The town of Brackett's 31 miles that way. My deputy's name is Len Carver. He's a good man. He'll help you fill out the necessary forms if you want to report your wife missing. 
 If you want my opinion, your wife is probably around here. Lost or plenty pissed off and giving you a scare. Either way, she'll turn up. 
 (V.O.) (filtered) Sheriff, this is dispatch. Mrs. Gilbert's locked out of her trailer again. Can you respond? 
 (into mike) 10-4, dispatch. Tell her I'm on my way. 
 I want your name and badge number. 
 Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93. This really isn't necessary -- 
 Don't tell me what's necessary, goddamnit. I'm noting the exact time of this conversation. 10:52 A.M. 
 (exhaling) Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor. 
 Is this a recent picture? 
 Two months old. 
 She still wear her hair like that? 
 Yes. 
 We'll certainly do our best, Mr. Taylor. There's over a hundred thousand people go missing in this country every year. Runaways, deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks hiding from the I.R.S. -- all vanishing without a trace. 
 Now I'm not saying she's one of them. I sure hope not. But unless there's a ransom demand or evidence of forced abduction, believe me, the F.B.I. won't even look at your case till it's been 24 hours. 
 Nevertheless, we'll sure keep our eyes peeled. How's that sound? 
 Did she come in? 
 (looks up, uninterested) Didn't see her. 
 You didn't see her, or she didn't come in? 
 Buddy, I told you the last time. I'm busy. Maybe she came in, maybe she didn't. All I know is, I didn't see her. 
 (confidentially) None of my business, mister. But if I was you I'd take a look in the ladies room. 
. 
 Amy? 
 
 Hey -- what the hell you doing?! 
 I want to see your order slips. 
 What? 
 You write down the names.   I want to see them. 
 What are you, nuts? I don't have to show you jack shit. 
 If my wife came in here, then her name's in that pile. 
 You calling me a liar? 
 Mister, I've had just about enough of you. 
 Let me see the fucking slips. 
 Now, mister, you're going to have to leave. 
 
 Please, I need the phone -- I have to call the police! 
 (drawls) My name's Billy. You the feller lookin' for his wife? 
 How'd you know? Did you see her? 
 Please, if you know something, anything, tell me. 
 What?    When? 
 No one's going to hurt you, Billy. Just tell me what you saw. 
 Yes... 
 Another truck? With who? 
 Do you know where they went? 
 Where by the river? 
 Who doesn't? The bartender?      The men in the truck? 
 Billy, I need you to come to the police. If you tell them what you saw, they'll be able to help me. 
 C'mon... work, goddammit... 
 Fuck. 
 (thank God) Yes. 
 Hello, Steve? It's Jeff Taylor... Listen, I -- don't put me on hold! I need a favor... I've gotta talk to that friend of yours at the F.B.I... No, it's about Amy, she's missing -- 
 I said Amy's been -- 
 Fuck! 
 Yes, I'm still here.       No -- don't call back -- Steve?!       Steve?! 
 Goddammit! 
 
 Shit! 
 (calling out) Out of the car! Put your hands where I can see 'em! 
 
 I said get out, dammit!   Now! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sonofabitch... 
 
 
 
 
 Fuck! 
 
 
 Goddammit... 
 
 
 
 
 He's getting away! 
 
 
 He's in the water!   I just saw him! 
 
 ... can't believe you let him get away... 
 You try chasing... through this shit... 
 Fuck... this is what happens when you get one without the other... 
 He coming around? 
 (weak) Where is she? 
 There's some... yeah... 
 (coming around; stalling) I don't -- there's different accounts... the balance fluctuates... 
 We been fucked with, is what I think. Little slut lied to us. Put 'em on the spot, they'll say anything to stay alive. 
 (blurting out) Ninety thousand. 
 (emphatic) Ninety thousand dollars. 
 Get out.   Don't try anything stupid. 
 (barely able to control himself) What do you want? 
 You sonofabitch -- 
 RED (CONT'D) Today's payday at the copper mine, so don't take any horsecock about how they haven't got it. If the manager gives you a hard time, that's your problem. It's your wife who's counting on you. 
 How do I know she's still alive? 
 (V.O.) (filtered) Copy that, Iron Man. 
 
 
 I need to see the manager. I need a wire transfer from my bank in Boston. 
 Yes... sir. I'm the manager. Would you like to have a seat? 
 Sir? 
 (turning; preoccupied) What? 
 I said you can have a seat if you want. 
 Right. 
 Here's my driver's license, credit card if you need it, my account number in Boston... How long is this going to take? 
 Are you all right? 
 (quickly) Yes, I'm fine. Look, that account only has $5,000 in it. How much can you advance me on my credit card? 
 Excuse me? 
 (impatient) My credit card. I've got a $6,000 limit. Can you advance me the whole $6,000? 
 No, I can't. For non-customers the limit is $500 a day. Sir, are you sure you're all right? 
 Yes, I'm fine. Just... transfer the money, okay? 
 Look, I'm going to tell you something. Whatever happens, just keep filling out that form, okay? 
 (looking up; baffled) Sir? 
 There are people watching -- 
 (O.S.) Excuse me, you the manager? 
 Yes, I am. 
 Lady over there said to see you about a car loan. 
 (indicating waiting area) Certainly, sir. Would you like to have a seat? 
 (turning back to Jeff) You were saying, Mr. Taylor? 
 Just... transfer the money. 
 Would you tell the manager I want the money in these denominations? 
. 
 I'm here. 
 The whole thing. Ninety thousand. 
 When do I see my wife? 
 Marie, this is Roger Calhoun down at the bank. Is the Sheriff there? (a beat) Well, maybe it's nothing, but you might tell him we just had a fellow in here acting kind of strange... 
 Toss the envelope on the seat. 
 No.   First you tell me where she is. 
 Wrong, asshole. First you give me the money, then you find out. Unless you want me to shoot you dead right here on the highway. 
 Now lift your shirt and jacket and turn around. 
 Turn around, hands behind your back, and step toward the truck. 
 Now get up in the truck, knees on the floor. Do it now! 
 I gave you the money.     Now let her go. 
 'Let her go.'    Do I look like I have her? 
 What the hell -- 
 (on phone) It's done. I'm heading in. (a beat; listening) Gotcha. 
 You gotta be the dumbest motherfuck yet. You think we picked you out of the blue? New car, Massachusetts plates -- probably be days before anyone misses you. Hell, you shoulda got the bumper sticker that goes with it: 'Rich Assholes Looking for Trouble!' 
 I'd have loved to see the look on your face when that car seized up. (mimicking panicked driver) Help, help, I ain't got no power! 
 You know what I'm gonna do first with your money, boy? Well, do you? 
 (fluttering bills under his nose) I'll give you a hint. Only one thing smells better than money. You wanta guess what? 
 What the hell? 
 These are... it's nothing but singles... (erupting) You lyin' sonofabitch! 
 Aaagghh! 
 Where is she, goddammit?   What'd you do with her? 
 Where is she?! 
 (barely able to breathe) Fuck you! 
 You like that?     How about this? 
 Four wheel anti-lock brakes, you sonofabitch! You want to try 'em again? 
 How about an emergency stop? You want to try that, Earl? Where is she? 
 I don't know! 
 Fuck you, you don't! 
 Stop! 
 Is that what you want? You really want me to stop? 'Cause I bet this baby stops on a dime! 
 What the hell? 
 End of the line, Earl! How about it? You gonna tell me? 
 She's with Billy. 
 Yeah?     Where's that? 
 I don't know!    Driving around! 
 (on radio) Repeat, I am in pursuit of a Dodge Ram pickup. Request back-up, repeat, request back-up! 
 Jesus Christ -- (on radio) Dispatch! Suspect identified as one Jeffrey Taylor, repeat, Jeffrey Taylor! 
 Where were you taking the money? 
 (losing it) To the truck stop... 
 Where? 
 Main highway... Texaco... 
 I know where she is!   My wife! 
 (ignoring him) Drop the gun! 
 You don't understand!      She's been kidnapped! 
 I understand plenty. Now get down on the ground or I'll shoot! 
 You there -- in the pickup! You all right? Can you get out? 
 Yeah! Just don't shoot me, officer! He's crazy, I tell you! 
 Well, get out dammit! 
 Officer, please. You gotta listen to me -- 
 (glances down at Jeff) Shut up. (to Earl) C'mon out, sir. It's safe -- 
 (weak) Shots fired... Officer down... Suspect... 
 (V.O.) Help is on the way, Sheriff. Just hang on. I have units and an ambulance en route. 
 (O.S.) (muffled) C'mon, baby, give it up! 
 
 
 (on phone) Hello? Can you hear me? This is Jeff Taylor. I need to talk to the deputy. 
 The name is Jeffrey Taylor. I just witnessed your sheriff being shot. Now put someone on, goddammit! 
 Hello? 
 It's no good. He's not talking. You better mobilize your boys. 
 Daddy, you're home! 
 Deke, get back to bed! I said now! (to Red) Warren? I thought you were coming back next week. 
 ... but it's four in the morning. Why can't Al and Billy come some other time? 
 (pointing to right hand) This one. 
 (pointing to left) This hand. 
 (he's been tricked) Dad... 
 Cool! 
 
 
 Man, if I never see another couple from Massachusetts it'll be too soon. 
 Figured I'd get started on the jewelry. 
 
 (startled) Aagh! 
 Goddamn.   Scared me half to death. 
 Shut up. (glaring at Amy) Lemme do her, Red. I'll cut her head off right now. 
 (O.S.) (muffled) Warren? You in there? 
 
 
 AL                             BILLY Howdy, Arleen.                     Hey, Missus C. 
 Well finally. Are you coming to breakfast? I've been calling you. 
 Amy?   Amy, can you hear me? 
 (louder) Amy? 
 Hang on, baby. They're in the house; I can't use the lights. I'm gonna get you out. 
 Fuck! 
 It's not working. If I make any more noise, they'll hear. 
 I'm going to get you out of there, Amy. 
 I love you. (under his breath) Please, God, let her still be alive. 
 (under his breath) Fuck you, asshole. 
 
 Give me the key. 
 Give me the fucking key! 
 Don't mister me, you sonofabitch! My wife is locked in a hole in your fucking barn! You don't give me the key, I'll blow your fucking head off! 
 (clueless) Warren? What's going on? 
 (to Arleen) Your husband's a kidnapper and a murderer is what's going on! Did you know that about him? Huh? (gestures) Ever wonder where all this stuff comes from? 
 (O.S.) Stick 'em up. 
 You don't want to do that, kid. Just put the gun down. 
 Put the gun down. 
 (voice quavering) My daddy keeps his rifle loaded all the time. He showed me in case I needed to protect Mommy when he's away. 
 I understand that, Deke. I'm not gonna hurt Mommy. But if you pull that trigger, there's a chance I'll still kill your father. 
 No, Deke, don't listen to him. He's wrong. 
 Deke, no -- ! 
 Oww -- goddammit, you little shit! 
 Don't fucking move! 
 Deke?   Deke?   Get on your feet! 
 It's okay, kid. Go over there, stand next to your mother. Hurry up. 
 Okay... on your feet.   Now, everybody! 
 Let's go.      Out. 
 (to Red) Okay. Reach into your pocket and hand the key to your wife. 
 (jams pistol at him) Do it. 
 (indicating barn door) Okay, now unlock it. 
 Good.  Now give me the keys. (turning to Deke) Deke, push the door open. Quickly. 
 That's enough, Deke. (gesturing them inside with gun) Let's go. Move it. 
 Deke, I need you to open this. 
 It's okay, Deke. There's a freezer down there with a woman in it. I need you to let her out. 
 (O.S.) (voice quavering) I can't see. 
 (O.S.) Dad... 
 (to Deke) Deke!    You at the freezer? 
 (O.S.) Yeah. 
 Okay. You're almost done. Just open it up, let the woman out. 
 She's all tied up with tape. 
 You got that Swiss Army knife your dad gave you? 
 (O.S.) Uh-huh. 
 Good man. Use that.   Make sure you don't hurt her. 
 (to Red) You better pray she's all right. 
 (O.S.) I got her -- 
 (O.S.) Jeff!!?? 
 Amy!!! 
 (O.S.) I'm almost free!!! 
 Amy, come up here! 
 They were going to kill me. 
 I know, baby. It's okay.       They can't hurt you now. 
 (to Red, Arleen, and Al) Okay.    Everybody in the cellar. 
 Do it! 
 Go to hell. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Amy, no!    It's not safe -- 
 (turning) But there's a phone inside.         We have to call the police. 
 One of them's still loose.      C'mon -- this way! 
 
 Hello?   Hello?     Anybody home? 
 (shouting) Hello? Anyone home? 
 C'mon, c'mon... 
 (re: keys) Take it. We may need to get out of here -- (into phone, suddenly) Hello! This is Jeff Taylor. I'm reporting an emergency... I don't know the address, the house belongs to a Red Barr -- I mean, Warren something... No, I don't know his name! 
 (suddenly hearing something) Jeff -- 
 No -- he kidnapped my wife, he's locked in a barn... Jeffrey Taylor. If you contact the police in -- 
 (panicked) Jeff! 
 Amy?! 
 C'mon! 
 
 
 Jeff, go!    Go! 
 
 
 Can't this thing go any faster?! 
 What the fuck?! 
 
 
 Get down! 
 
 
 
! 
 
 
 
 Jeff! 
 It's glass!   Use the rifle!

 You all right? 
 (O.S.) Jeff... 
 Yeah? 
 (O.S.) Jeff... I can't get out... 
 What is it? 
 (wriggling) It's just... I can't get out... 
 What do you mean? 
 I mean I can't get out! 
 C'mon, Amy, push! 
 Push, goddammit! 
 
 
 (turning, reacting) Jeff! 
 
 
 
 
 
 (panicked) Jeff? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Oh God... Jeff... 
 
 C'mon, Amy, it's all you now... you can do it... 
 
 
 
 
! 
 
 Don't let me go, Jeff... 
 I won't, baby... I won't ever let you go... 
 How's the sheriff? 
 Out of surgery. It looks like he's gonna make it. As for the wife and kid, she's not talking, he's being turned over to Protective Services. 
 We've got I.D. on the dead suspects. Turns out they were all licensed truckers. One of 'em had a rap for check kiting. Otherwise they could've been model citizens. 
 What about the leader? 
 Same thing. His real name's Warren Claney. Three speeding tickets in five years -- apart from that, he's clean as a whistle. 
 (dazed) How could they do it? How could they treat it like a... business? 
 (shaking his head) I don't know. I've been doing this 15 years, I've never seen anything like it. (MORE) 
 (re: media) C'mon -- let's get you folks out of here before things really get hairy. 
 Promise me one thing... 
 Name it.

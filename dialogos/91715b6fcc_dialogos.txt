 You make sure to get us as close as you can, okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a little extra. 
 Don't worry. I take you close. But not too close. (rubbing Eric's head) You don't want them to eat you. 
 ENRIQUE (CONT'D) Ready, amigos? 
 What was that? 
 ERIC (CONT'D) Ben! 
 Unclip your line! 
 (O.S.) 
 RRRRROW! GRRRRRR! 
 Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in fighting each other. But these... (picking up two other dinosaurs) See, these are carnivores. And this one here -- see its claws -- this one here uses its claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent… 
 (interrupting) Uh, Alan? 
 Hmm? 
 He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older? 
 Oh, right. (back to Charlie) Happy dinosaurs. 
 That must be Mark. (calling out) Mark, we’re back here! 
 ELLIE (CONT'D) Good day? 
 Keeping the world safe. (re: baby) Here, let me take her. 
 Mark, this is Alan Grant. 
 Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about you. 
 Daddy, this is a herbabore. 
 What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my name Alan? Say my name. 
 GRANT (CONT'D) He used to know me. 
 Sorry, Alan it's been six years. 
 More coffee? 
 (relived) Yes. Great. 
 ELLIE (CONT'D) So, Mark's working at the State Department now. 
 Really? (To Mark) What do you do there? 
 (with mock bravado) I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to kill you. 
 Indeed. 
 So what are you working on now? 
 
 Anything good? 
 Raptors, mostly. 
 My favorite. 
 You remember the sounds they made? 
 I try not to. 
 We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team. 
 You think they could talk to each other? 
 To a degree we never imagined. 
 Bullshit! 
 You taught him that. 
 Good luck with the fund raising. 
 It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur. 
 Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that. 
 The last of my breed. 
 GRANT (CONT'D) I'd better get going. 
 Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime. 
 (deep down knowing he never will) Okay. Goodbye, Ellie. 
 Goodbye, Alan. 
 ELLIE (CONT'D) When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved. 
 A well-accepted theory. 
 (simply) Alan don't be afraid to evolve. 
 It's through the painstaking study of the Interior chamber in multiple specimens that we can determine this exciting correlation between the larynx and the upper plate. That lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that the raptor might have been capable of bird- like vocalizations. Which as you can imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough. 
. 
 Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does anyone have a question? 
 Does anyone have a question that doesn't relate to Jurassic Park? 
 Your theory on raptors is good and all, but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot? 
 No, and let me be perfectly clear on this point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago. What's left of them is fossilized in stone the actual scientists spend years to undercover. (MORE) 
 GRANT (CONT'D) what John Hammond and InGen created are theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing less. 
 You're saying you wouldn't want to study them if you had the chance? 
 No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on that island. 
 UDESKY (CONT'D) You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This is going to be a piece of cake. 
 Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right. 
 I can never tell what's bone and what's rock. 
 Rough. 
 
 Mr. Brennan. 
 We'll be broke in four weeks. 
 You rented an automated litter box. 
 Not if it can't dig. 
 Absolutely not. 
 What? 
 Dr. Grant? 
 Yes? 
 (extending his hand) Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises (reaching into his pocket) My card. 
 What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? 
 Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat. 
 You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time. 
 I guarantee it'll be worth your while. 
 It's be my pleasure. 
 First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years. 
 It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring. 
 Thank you. 
 Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile... 
 We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight. 
 Hmmm. 
 Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something... 
 ...once-in-a-lifetime. 
 We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide. 
 That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified... 
 No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you. 
 I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you can’t fly low enough to see anything of interest. 
 You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low. 
 Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else. 
 From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want. 
 That's hard to believe. 
 Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government. 
 Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is for us to have you come along. It would make all the difference. 
... 
 Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag. 
 That does sound lucky. 
 Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic. 
 The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away. (beat) And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people. 
 Through our church. 
 Uh…the one that worships God and believes in being Good. 
 A 
 Alan. 
 
 (Spanish accent) Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are flying in restricted airspace. Immediately turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat redirect to... 
 (yelling back) No, I thought I'd keep it to myself. 
 There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the coloration. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see... 
 Are we on? 
 That's not the landing gear? 
 GRANT (CONT'D) What you're... (realizing) You can't land. 
 Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy. 
 This plane can not land! 
 It's going to be all right. Just... 
 Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben! Erriccc! 
 Tell me we didn't land. 
. 
 Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we had to be so... 
 What the hell is going on? What are they doing? 
 Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green... 
 Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane... 
 (on-bullhorn) 
 ERRR-IIIC! 
 And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals. 
 (yelling) Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea! 
 (on the bullhorn) What? 
 (pointing broadly at Alan) He says it's a bad idea! 
 (on the bullhorn) What's a bad idea? 
 (to Alan) What was that? 
 I don't think so. 
 GRANT (CONT'D) Sounds bigger. 
 What's the problem? Can't you guys...? 
 We can't just... 
 Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back. 
 (yelling back) We're going! 
 
 Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy. 
 Coop, you know I can't do it pal. 
 What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper! 
 A 
 Oh, my God! Paul, my God! 
. 
 Who's got the sat-phone? 
 Right here! 
 We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please try your call again later... 
 Shit! 
 What is it? What's the matter? 
 
. 
 This way! 
 
 Don't worry. It's dead. 
 
 GRANT (CONT'D) Nobody move a muscle. 
 Come on! 
 Why did you bring us here? 
 Our son is on this island. We need your help to find him. 
 This is him. Eric. He’s thirteen now. He's just about the greatest kid in the world. 
 He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand. 
 Her new boyfriend. 
 A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back. 
 We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that? 
 So you hired these mercenaries. 
 (interrupting) Then you duped us into coming here. 
 We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before. 
 (disbelieving) I have never been on this island! 
 Sure you have. You wrote that book... 
 (low, to Udesky) I didn't know, there were two islands. 
 Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids. 
 A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed. (finally) How many days have they been missing? 
 Eight weeks. 
 After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive? 
 He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs. 
 No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island. 
 Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son. 
 You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive. 
 What do we do? 
 Excellent. 
 Sorry. 
 Nothing you haven't seen before. 
 AMANDA (CONT'D) How much weight have you lost? 
 Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y. 
 You hate to swim. 
 People change. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) You look good. 
 So do you. 
 How would you classify it? 
 They never got that big. 
 Not with that sail. (Billy gives up) Spinosaurus Aegypticus. 
 That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to? 
 Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top. 
 There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there? 
 There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that. 
 Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even the store. and if we make it off this island with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me the rest of my life. 
 Eric! 
 Quiet! 
 (loud whisper to Amanda) Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory. 
 Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area. 
 No, Dr. Grant says... 
 Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that... 
 Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him? 
 Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast. 
 Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me. 
 Oh, don't worry about that. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 What did you say? 
 Nothing. 
 What did you say! 
 Just drop it Paul! 
 Young adult. 
 Eric... 
 That's Ben's! 
 We should take it with us to signal any planes. 
 It works! 
 (O.S.) (excited) That's him. That’s Eric! 
 (O.S.) I filmed this the morning they left. 
 Ben! 
 Unclip the line! 
 BEN (CONT'D) Hand on! Hang on buddy! 
 BEN (CONT'D) Are you ok, buddy? 
 (through his sobs) I don't know. I think so. 
 We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get ready. I'm going to unhook you. 
 I'm all right 
 (O.S) (weaker) We're going to get out of this, pal. 
 See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's going to be all right now. 
 A. 
 PAUL (CONT'D) Amanda! 
 I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him. 
 No, it's... 
 I know you liked Ben. I had no right to... 
 (frustrated) It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone. 
 AMANDA (CONT'D) I guess I was hoping that with Ben around, there'd be someone to keep him safe. 
 Raptors. 
 (to Paul) What’s a raptor? 
 If we came across one, we might live. 
 Well that's good. 
 But you never came across just one. 
 Wait! Where's Billy? 
 (almost sotto) I thought we weren't suppose to yell. 
 Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish. 
 I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in there. I'd bet my bottom dollar. 
 (calling out) Eric! Are you here? 
 Eric! 
 AMANDA (CONT'D) What the hell. 
 Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy- five. How about you guys? 
 This is how you make dinosaurs? 
 This is how you play God. 
 Amanda! 
 Back out! Move! 
 In here! 
 Push! 
 She's calling for help. 
 Head for the trees! 
! 
! 
 KEEP GOING! 
 Udesky. 
 (Listening) He's this way. 
 It's not safe. 
 We have to help him. 
 He's not a kill, he's still alive. 
 They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down. 
 Where's Grant? 
 What does that mean? What are you saying? 
 GRANT (CONT'D) God damn you, Billy. 
 GRANT (CONT'D) It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We want the egg." 
 A 
 
 A 
 Come on! They'll be back! 
, 
 Eric... 
 GRANT (CONT'D) Eric, your parents are both here. 
 In Costa Rica? 
 On the island. 
 They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out. 
 You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too. 
 You're Alan Grant, aren't you? (off surprised reaction) I read both of your books. 
 Which one do you prefer? 
 The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then. 
 Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me. 
 When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind. 
 Any weapons, radios? 
 Found this, but the battery's dead. 
 It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks. 
 Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer. 
 (trying to be positive) The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common. 
 GRANT (CONT'D) Did you read Malcolm's book? 
 Yeah. 
 What did you think? 
 I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself. 
 That's two things we have in common. 
 We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere. 
 I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night. (to Billy) Am I right? 
 I thought you were an expert. 
 Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to have to figure out what to do ourselves. 
 I just want you know, Amanda. It's not your fault what happened. 
 Well what? 
 Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it. 
 This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years. 
 That one time was just the bumper. 
 He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe. (beat) I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here. 
 I'm not sorry at all. 
 Know what this is? 
 (takes it) A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil. 
 Mine's new. 
 How much of this island have you explored? 
 I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start. 
 We need to head for the coast. 
 Are you sure? 
 Why? 
 Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get. 
 What about Eric and Dr. Grant? 
 What about Eric? 
 (rationalizing) He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island. (to Billy) Right? 
 My phone. 
 You had the phone the whole time? 
 I don't know. I don't have it with me. 
 When did you have it last? 
 I don't remember 
 Think. 
 The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in my coat pocket, and... 
 What?...WHAT!? 
 I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he... 
 A 
 Mon! Dad! 
 (reassuring him) Sweetheart, you're okay. (reassuring herself) You're okay. (disbelieving) You're okay. 
 Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh? 
 We do. 
 Honey, there's not enough spit in the world for that. 
 We need to keep moving. 
 Billy, I can't talk to you now. 
 (finally turning on him) Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else. (finally) You're no better than the people who built this place. 
 We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up. 
 Then we go home? 
 Then we go home. 
 You okay? 
 How about if we try this way? 
 Do you think it goes all the way across? 
 One way to find out. 
 GRANT (CONT'D) (glancing back) We'd better do this one at a time. 
. 
 Dr. Grant? 
 (O.S.) Come on over. One at a time. 
 Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me. 
 We're not going anywhere, I promise. 
 (calling out) Okay! Come on, Eric! 
 How 'bout if I... 
 No, I can do it. 
 (muttering to himself) That's it Eric. Nice and easy... 
 Mom? 
 Oh, my God. 
 What is it? 
 A bird cage. 
 Eric! 
 
 
! 
 (shouting) Paul! Where is he? Can you see him? 
 (shouting back) I'm trying! That thing took him down this way! 
 Split up! 
 BILLY! WAIT! 
 NO! 
 Hang on, Eric! 
 A 
. 
 He made it! 
 GRANT (CONT'D) Billy, look out! 
 Billy! 
 It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use. 
 
 My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing. 
 You couldn't have made that jump. 
 I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy. 
 How would you have helped Eric? (he can't answer) He needs you, Paul. He needs us. 
 He could have died. 
 But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that. 
 Do you have any kids? 
 No. Although I've studied them in the wild. 
 GRANT (CON'T) I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts. 
 I want to be an astronaut. 
 See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground. 
 But then you never get to go in space. 
 Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do. 
 Keep quiet. 
 Find it before it stops ringing! 
 I've got something. I think I've got something! 
 I've got it! I've got it! 
 Can't help but be a little offended. 
 Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing. 
 Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help. 
 (to Amanda) Stan. 
 I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a blizzard. 
 What's that? 
 Bonitas. 
 Something must've scared them. 
 Get the motor going. 
 Who are you calling? 
 Pick up! Pick up! 
 Hewwo? 
 Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right away! 
 GRANT (CONT'D) Charlie? Are you there? 
 Hewwo? 
 
 (desperate) Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get mommy, okay? 
 Okay. 
! 
 
 
 Was somebody on the phone? 
 Dinosaur man. 
 
! 
 Alan? 
 ELLIE (CONT'D) Alan? Alan! 
 (imitating) Raaaar! 
 
! 
 
! 
 (looking around) Up! Up! 
 Where's Dad? 
 Just hold on. 
 Jump! Swim for the far shore! 
 We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to. 
 I know. I know. I want to look for him too. 
 then we should... 
 Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much. 
 He loves you too. 
 Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay? 
 AMANDA (CONT'D) We're going to get out of this, and everything's going to be all right, I promise. 
 A Listen to your mother. 
 Good thing I've been swimming, huh? 
: 
 You remember when we went fishing last summer? And I was trying to put the boat in and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck came and tried to pull it out, but it got dragged in? And the truck driver threatened to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I was the governor and he believed me? 
 Yeah. 
 That was a fun day. 
 We should try fishing again. 
 You mean it? 
 I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently. 
 The lady you called, how do you know she can help us? 
 She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything. 
 GRANT (CONT'D) It's strikes me now I never told her that. 
 You should. 
 You're right. 
 GRANT (CONT'D) Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash? 
 No. I couldn't see. 
 Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you? (pre-empting objections) They look worried. 
. 
 (excited) Mom! Dad! 
 Helicopters. Helicopters! 
 (yelling over) Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming! 
 ERIC (CONT'D) We're safe! 
 (to himself) No we're not. 
 GRANT (CONT'D) NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES! 
 A 
 (to the pilot) You have to go back! We can't leave him! 
 They're not following. 
 (shouting over the noise) We have to cut it! Find something sharp! 
 What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs? 
 The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles. 
 Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age. 
 I would completely support that. 
 I hope they don't. I want to come back someday.

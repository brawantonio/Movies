 2t2Is that your wife? 
 2t2No.  It was a friend of hers. 
 2t2I should go. 
 2t2No.  Why? 
 2t2You must be tired.  Those pills must be working. 
 2t2I don't think they're working at all. 
 2t2Still.  You're married, right? 
 2t2Yeah, but, please don't go.  Please.  Time has a way of slowing down when you're around. 
 2t2Really?  For me, too. 
 2t2So you'll stay? 
 2t2If you want me to. 
 2t2Can I ask you something? 
 2t2What? 
 2t2Do you think my writing is good? 
 2t2You've done some good work. 
 2t2Yeah.  C minus good. 
 2t2I told you, I was in a bad mood when I graded that. 
 2t2I guess so. 
 
 2t2What's wrong? 
 2t2I don't know.  Maybe it's those pills.  I don't know. 
 2t2Just relax.  Lie back. 
 2t2No.  Please.  Just stop. 
 2t2It's just not working.  OK? 
 2t2Alright.  I'm sorry. 
 2t2Maybe I should go. 
 2t2No.  Please, don't.  It's my fault.  Please.  Don't go. 
 2t2Damn, I'm so stupid. 
 2t2No, it's me.  Please. 
 2t2This was a mistake.

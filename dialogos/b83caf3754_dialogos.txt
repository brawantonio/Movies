 BOY'S VOICE When can I see him? 
 WOMAN'S VOICE When he's well. 
 WOMAN'S VOICE I don't know. -- and the sound of a door closing. A small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds revealing the snow-patched street below. Leonard's friend, crossing it, glances back . . . then disappears around a corner. And the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down, extinguishing the single ray of light. 
 Yes? 
 When you say people ... you mean living people,                 . Behind an old oak desk, the hospital's Director glances over to its Chief of Medicine, Dr. Kaufman, with a look that seems to wonder, As opposed to what? 
 Living people, yes.   Patients. 
 I ' m here for the research                                 * position . . . in your neurology                            * lab. 
 Neurology lab? He doesn't laugh at Sayer, just at the thought of it. 
 We have an x-ray room. Sayer tries to share the Director's amusement with a good- * natured smile, but doesn't really understand it. Kaufman seems * to have less time for this, and in plain English, unadorned -  * 
 - The-position-ds-Staff-^Neurologist.            . Sayer looks like a man who's just learned that everything he * knows about the world is wrong.         f 
 (pause) A doctor ... doctor. The Director refers to stapled sheets of paper in his hands, Sayer's resume. 
 The Camel Institute. Tell me                                * about that, anything with patients                          * there? Or . . .                                             * 
 (burying it) Earthworms. The Director isn't sure he heard right. 
 Sorry?                               , > 
 It was an immense project. " I was trying to extract a decigram of myelin from four tons of earthworms. 
 I was on it for five years. I was the only one who really believed in it. The rest of them said it couldn't be done.                         t 
 It can't. 
 Well, I know that now.       I proved it. The director offers a slow tentative nod before consulting the resume again. 
 Maybe before. At Saint Thomas. (Sayer is already shaking his head no) All research. Earth - ? 
 Pigs brains . . . they·re quite similar to human brains. 
 (hopefully) Are they? 
 Oh, yes . . . three years. As the Director retreats back to the resume, hoping against hope of finding in it something germane, Sayer glances away to a window. He wishes he were outside it. He has no business being here. He should leave. 
 Excuse me, I made a mistake coming here. Clearly you're looking for someone with more of a clinical background. He stands up to leave. Kaufman stands to see him out.      But the       * director keeps searching the resume. 
 Thanks anyway. 
 Back in medical school ... Kaufman shoots the Director a look that says, No, we're not that desperate. 
 I mean, you couldn't have graduated without some clinical experience. . Sayer hesitates. And eventually manages sort of a shrug and a n od .,            v' 
 Well, there we are, doctor. Kaufman can't believe it, but is sent back a look that says, We have no choice. The Director gets up out of his chair, and, smiling broadly, extends his hand to Sayer. Which unsettles Sayer. Which in turn unsettles the Director. 
 (not far from                 v begging) You do want the job, don't you? Sayer isn't so sure.   He thinks about it long and hard . . . 
 O.S. Spent much time in chronic hospitals, doctor? A patient approaches, and, passing Sayer and the orderly who's escorting him (ANTHONY), offers - 
 1 Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello . . . 
 I guess not. As they pass an old patient in a wheelchair - 
 Hey, how you doing? (calling to someone down the hall) Dr. Sullivan. Staying on the old patient, he eventually manages, too late - 
 Fn ... ie Down the hall in an alcove, Dr. Sullivan glances up long sufferingly from-a.patient~with'.an .Ouij a-board who !.s mumbling,          * complaining, unintelligibly. Anthony and Sayer arrrive. 
 Dr. Sullivan, this is Dr. Sayer; ' ': : '                      '   -'. There's a kind a "deadness" in Sullivan's eyes and voice; he's been here too long. 
 Not the neurologist, that'd be asking too much. You're not the neurologist. 
 I think I am. Sayer extends his hand. Instead of shaking it - 
 Well, come on, Anthony, get him a coat for Christ's sake. - Sullivan thrusts his clipboard into Sayer's hand. 9.   OMITTED                                                                9. 10. INT. DAYROOM (A) - DAY                                              10. A woman in a wheelchair uttering high-pitched screams (FEMALE PATIENT 2 ) . Sayer in a lab coat trying to calm her. 
 1 X was born in I911f in Kinasbridae, New York. I came here in July of 1955. Prior to July of 1955. I resided a£ the Brooklyn Psychiatric Centerf Brooklyn. New York. Prior to thatP I was a person. And you. sir.- i Who the* hell >are.*v.ou?       . 
 Mrs. Cohen? 
 MRS. COHEN He·s here? She smiles, glances around. Sayer hesitates, uncertain who she means. 
 I 'm here. (pause) To examine you. 
 MRS. COHEN Oh, no, I ' m leaving today. My son's coming to take me home. 
 Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen's son. He's coming today? 
 1 I wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't for twenty years. The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen, trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the ribbon from her hair. 13.    OMITTED                                    . v 
 O.S. (a matter of fact) It gets easier. Sayer turns to the voice, to Miss Costello, the hospital's head nurse, a veteran of this place, a woman who has seen it all. She's standing in the doorway. 
 You don't think it will, but it does. A moment and she A urns and leaves. t 
 SAYER'S VOICE Can you hear me?                 . 
 SAYER'S VOICE Do you know where you are? (nothing back) Do you remember being brought here? (nothing back) Do you know what has happened? If she does, she gives no indication. No word or gesture. No change of expression on her mask of a face. She is elsewhere (or nowhere), cut adrift by her illness, living in a private world (or hell). 
 SAYER'S VOICE Can you hear me? Sayer, wearing a white lab coat, tries to read her eyes. Behind thick lenses, uncleaned for weeks or months, the eyes are inscrutable.                                         .   ·· 
 SAYER«S VOICE Her name is Lucy Fishman . . . r 
 SAYER'S VOICE She was found by neighbors with                               * her sister, several days after the , sister had died . . . 
 SAYER (CONT'D) According to the neighbors,                                    * she's never set foot outside her                               * apartment, has no other living                                 * relatives, and has always been the                             * way she is now - without any                                   * comprehension or response.                                     * 
 And yet . . . Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at her. Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it. And stays there, stiff, still. Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufman's face is that of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card tricks. Dismissing the phenomenon --· 
 DR. KAUFMAN A reflex. 
 If she batted it away I might call that a reflex. She doesn't bat it away, she catches it. 
 DR. KAUFMAN -        It's still a reflex. ..·.    :        · ·' .· " .' 
 I'm sorry, if you were right I'd agree with you. Kaufman, understandably, takes some offense at the comment. Sayer, however, is unaware that he has caused any. 
 It's as if . . . having lost all will of her own on which to act, she borrows the will of the ball. Awkward silence.    Eventually-- 
 DR. TYLER The "will of the ball?" . Sayer nods. Kaufman and the other doctors concur with glances that the theory and theorist are absurd. 
 DR. SULLIVAN Excuse me. Sullivan has better things to do and leaves the room.   So does Tyler. Kaufman and Miss Costello remain. 
 DR. KAUFMAN                                 .       I (hopefully) You're trying to make a good impression. That's it, isn't it? You're still settling in. Sayer isn't sure if he should agree or not.   He does neither. 
 DR. KAUFMAN Miss Costello, you'll see that Dr. Saver's patients waiting out there are rescheduled for tomorrow? 
 Yes, sir. 
 DR. KAUFMAN Good night. Sayer watches Kaufman leave. So does Miss Costello. Lucy, looking less like a woman than a Diane Arbus photograph of one, doesn't. 
 One . . .                                                  . * (he turns the key) Two . . . (puts on sunglasses) Three . . . (releases the brake) Four . . . (shifts out of 'park') . Five. Just as he's depressing the accelerator, someone raps on his window. He slams on the brakes. Miss Costello's face appears at the window. Recovering, Sayer rolls it down. 
 What'd I forget? 
 I just wanted to say to you I preferred your explanation. ()   It's unclear whether he knows what she's referring to. r 
 And that I'll look after things for you until you've "settled in." Good night, doctor. She leaves. He stares blankly out after her, then at his dashboard. To it eventually, quietly -- 
 Thank you . . . He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away toward her car. To the reflection -- 
 Thank you very much. 
 V.O. I am not mad ... not mad . . . 
 V.O. I know the difference between what is real and what is not . . . Beyond a chain-link fence, across the field, on the roof of one of Bainbridge's brick buildings, peering down from the edge of it, coat over his smock, hat on his head, an elderly man. 
 The voice was real. 
 What did the voice say? 
 "Mr. Titch, get your coat and hat, go up to the roof and jump off." 
 Did you recognize it as belonging to a person? Or was it just a voice? Sidney considers Sayer suspiciously ... then smiles slyly.        * * 
 You don't deny it was you.                                  * 
 * Me? Sayer is taken aback. As is Sidney. One of them, and Sidney believes he knows which, is lying or crazy. 
 ' ' · * '        . I do deny it. It wasn't me. It wasn't real. (pause) We've only just now met, sir.       » Sidney, suddenly completely disoriented, withdraws. 
 If that's true . . . I'm in a predicament. 
 DR. SULLIVAN * We'd be high up - 40th, 50th floor, nice midtown view - suite                            * of offices, carpeted, good-looking                          * receptionist -                                              * 
 DR. SULLIVAN We could have all that ... but we'd miss all this. We'd miss        the wards. 
 DR. TYLER The smell of them. 
 DR. SULLIVAN We'd miss this place - (this cafeteria) We'd miss this . . . (the plate of mush as it's set down onto his tray) Whatever this is.        . 
 Ye .... s Sayer glances up at them, having paid attention to nothing they've said, and nods at some other thought. 
 .        '    Yes . . .    ,' He leaves his tray where he stands, and heads out of the cafeteria.                                 v 
 Did you see me when-1 "spoke?" Sidney thinks about it, tries to remember, to summon back the moment in question, to picture it exactly as it happened, or didn't happen. 
 No. 
 You see me now though. 
 Yes.

 "Atypical Hysteria," this one. Sayer nods to himself and keeps reading his. He eventually finds in its text -- ATYPICAL RABIES. He flips to the end of the file. "No change since last examination" it reads. He turns the page. "No change, no therapy recommended." He turns the page, the last entry. "No change." The date, "11/9/44." 
 There must be more recent files we missed somehow. "Part Twos" to their medical histories. (Miss Costello is shaking head 'no.') In some other filing cabinet somewhere.                 . .. 
 NO. 
 One would think that after a point enough atypical somethings would amount to a typical something. But a typical "what?" Miss Costello, no doubt, has less of an idea than Sayer what the "what" could be. 
 ,            Doctor . . . would you like      to g e t a cup of coffee somewhere? (pause) Tea? 
 Ah . . . normally I'd say yes . . . only I've made other plans . . . She nods quickly.    She seems, strangely, relieved. 
 Some other time. 
 Yes. 
 , Good night. 
 Good night. They veer apart to their respective cars. 
 Tea, right?                 · / · 
 P e s . '...-· lae The waiter leaves. Sayer glances back into the fish tank at the eel behind the rock, its rock, its home. 
 I'm sorry, doctor. I thought someone left the lights on. 
 They all survived encephalitis years before they came here. In the 1920' s . He taps a finger at the files - the patients' medical histories prior to admission - forms listing childhood diseases and ailments. The janitor, having no idea of course what he means, retreats with his pail and mop, closing the door. 36A. EXT. MEDICAL LIBRARY, NEW YORK - ESTABLISH - DAY            36A. 37.   INT. MEDICAL LIBRARY, NEW YORK - DAY                         37. Sayer displays what he has written on the back of his hand to * an assistant librarian: NEJM 4-6-35. 
 The New England Journal of Medicine, April 6th, 1935.                                    * 
 (philosophically detached) Pus and pain, that's the final                                * reward. Pus and pain and obscurity. He's in a small unkept rose garden. With Sayer.                         * 
                . I believe you when you say some still live. But I can assure you they're medically irrelevant. As they were thirty years ago when I fought to get my work published. He smiles at a thought, at once wistful and bitter. 
 That's the problem with a unique disease. Once it no longer rages, I'm telling you, it becomes very unfashionable.         . He buries his face into his mask, manages to get some deep breaths into his lungs and shakes his head at Sayer. 
 What would I be without this thing? A man with a1 shred of dignity le_ft. 
 Should I get your nurse? 
 God forbid, no. He lights a cigarette, coughs and puts it out. 
 How many have you found there? 
 Five. So far. I think there may be more. The old doctor nods. He has the torn look of someone reminded of an unfaithful lover just when he'd managed to forget about her. He wants and doesn't want to know how they're doing. Finally -- 
 How are they? 
 As you described them. As they were back then. As "insubstantial as ghosts." Only I guess most of them were children then. 
 Yes.   Children who fell asleep. 
 Most died during the acute stage of the illness, during a sleep so deep they couldn't be roused. A sleep that in most cases lasted several months. The doctors, in the dark, watch forty year old footage projected onto a screen by a pre-World War II Bell & Howell - a motionless man in a chair, his head thrust back, mouth gaping open, arms suspended out from an emaciated torso as if from invisible strings. 
 Those who survived, who awoke, seemed fine, as though nothing had happened. Years went by - five, ten, fifteen - before anyone suspected they were not well. . They were not. A doctor, this doctor decades younger, appears beside the subject on the screen and lowers the man's arms. 
 I began to see them in the early 1930's - old people brought in by their children, young people brought in by their parents - all of them complaining they weren't "themselves" anymore. They'd grown distant, aloof, anti-social, they daydreamed at the dinner table. I referred them to psychiatrists. The man on the screen disappears and is replaced by a seal- shaped woman in whom a hundred strange diseases seem to reside. They conspire against her, torment and harass her, force her to perform incessant and meaningless actions with her hands, to paw her chin, to flutter, to adjust glasses that aren't there. 
 
 What must it be like to be them? On the screen, the young man's eyes, entranced, gaze upward as if trying hard to remember something. Or trying hard to forget it. 
 What are they thinking?       . 
 
 (hopefully) We know that for a fact. 
 Yes. 
 Bec use . . . a 4 
 Because the alternative is unthinkable. 
 Sorry.                                      . 
 It's different. 
 Quite.   It's quite bad. Sayer keeps studying it. 
 (more to himself) Did he fail to understand? Or was he unwilling to fail? He isn't really asking her to answer, which is fine with her since she doubts equally both hypotheses. 
 Could he be saying, "I can't draw a triangle, don't make me"? (before she can respond:) Could it be willfully bad? She doesn't say it but it's clear she thinks Sayer is reading far too much into the "badness" of the patient's scrawl. To himself - 
 Which one is this? He leans closer to see the typed name . . . 
 MRS. LOWE Of course not. Not in words. 
 He speaks to you in other ways. How do you mean? MRS. LOWE   i You don't have children. 
 No. , 
 MRS. LOWE If you did you'd know. Finished with his hair, she wheels him from the sleeping ward         * and into the - 
 I'd like to examine him again-if that's all right with you. 
 MRS. LOWE                              , He did well. 
 In a sense. 
 MRS. LOWE He's very clever. Aren't you, Leonard.                    . Sayer shows her the perception test "drawing** Leonard made. 
 Does this mean anything to you? 
 MRS. LOWE                          . (more to Leonard)                               ;· It's very good.                                       '· . She glances back to Sayer who nods uncertainly. She recognizes. the look on his face; she's seen it before on the faces of more doctors than she cares to remember.                 '         f 
 MRS. LOWE (becoming impatient with him) Well it's abstract, isn't it. Sayer can't bring himself to agree with her. 
 MRS. LOWE That's the problem with all you doctors, you have no imagination. Everything has to be real to you. No longer having any use for him, she pointedly ignores him. * Taking the hint, Sayer's wanders off, past Lucy, looking like a statue, holding the paper cup he brought her. 
                  . I want to know more about him. 
 MRS. LOWE 0.8. Something was wrong, they said, with his hands. He couldn't write anymore, he couldn't do the work, I should take him out of school, they said. He was eleven. They're in Leonard's old bedroom, Sayer and Mrs. Lowe. Except for the Western painting that's missing, nothing has changed in it in thirty years. 
 MRS. LOWE He slowly got worse. He'd be talking, suddenly he'd come to a stop. After a few seconds he'd finish what he was saying like nothing happened, but these standstills got longer. Sometimes he'd call to me and I'd come in and find him at his desk in a trance. An hour, two hours. Then he'd be okay again. 
 MRS. LOWE One day I came hone from work and found him in his bed, his arm like this, reaching. (pause) "What do you want, Leonard?" She pictures the moment in her mind, and waits, it seems, for the young Leonard to speak, to tell her what it is he wants. Finally she lowers her arm and shrugs. 
 MR.S LOWE He never spoke again. It was like he'd disappeared. I took him to Bainbridge later that year. November fourteenth, 1937. He was twenty. Sayer glances away from her to the room itself again. 
 What'd he do with himself, Mrs. Lowe, those nine years he stayed in this room? She smiles to herself, proudly it seems. 
 MRS. LOWE He read.                        y 
 When you say you're working with people, you don't mean living people.                               ( 
 Living people, yes. Patients. Mann just stares. He's a scientist, they both are, and the idea of Sayer working with living people, rather than expired ones laid out on the pathology table, is inconceivable to him. 
 (fearing the answer) Where? 
 It's in The Bronx. It's a poor private chronic hospital called M ou nt -- 
 (appalled) Oh, Malcolm, Malcolm, come back, come on. You're a benchman, you're no clinician, why would you lower yourself? Sayer hasn't an answer for him.           »· 
 How's Hank? 
 How's Hank? He's great, he's brilliant, look at him. Sayer glances away to Hank the monkey, watches him. Mann studies Sayer, chagrined and incredulous. 
 A physician? You? He slaps him angrily across the shoulders with some papers. The monkey completes a complex sequence which opens a chamber revealing an electric train. The animal jumps and hoots with wild glee. Sayer reaches out and presses the button on the stop watch dangling from Mann's neck. 
 Subtract two seconds off his time. 
 (to, Sayer) Don't look at me like that. It's for his alphabet lessons. (to the monkey) We're busy, Hank, go play solitaire. The monkey obediently goes off in search of a deck of cards. Gesturing at patterns on the EEG -- 
 Asleep. First stage normal. Second a little dull. Normal 
... E He shrugs, lays out a second EEG, and gestures at patterns on it -- 
 Awake. Slightly erratic. No more so than a lot of people walking the streets of New York. (shrugs again) I give up, what's wrong with him? 
 You have them backwards. This is him awake . . . (points to one EEG; then the other) This is him asleep. .-," -           .                            ^       · Mann thinks Sayer is kidding. He isn't. 
 This is him awake? This is him asleep? Sayer nods. Mann tries, without success, to make some sort of sense out of that. 
 What are you saying? When he's awake, what, he's dreaming? 
 When there's any brain activity at all, which is infrequent, yes. Dreaming or hallucinating. 
 And when he's asleep . . . ? 
 When he's asleep he manages to create a kind of reality. What we might call reality. 
 That's what you think these say? 
 1 don't know. Mann studies the "waking" EEC     He points to its one and only large electrical peak.                     ; 
 What's this peak? Strobe? 
 No. This is the strobe. Sayer indicates a flat section of the pattern where there is scribbled in pencil a small "s." 
 This . . . ,               (the large peak, marked with an "L")                / . . . is me saying his name to him. Mann stares rather dumbly at Sayer. Then at Hank the monkey on the floor dealing solitaire. 
 The patients have all been given their morning medication. 
 Good. Dr. Sayer was hoping you'd have some free time. She hands a book to the nurse who spoke (MARGARET), a first edition worn /rom many readings. Margaret glances from it to the other nurses and back to Miss Costello. 
 "Call me . . . Ish-ma-el . . .

 If it is, I don't know it. Maybe it's three different games.

 O.S. Leonard? 
 I'll begin moving the pointer toward the "L." For "Leonard." Once I feel you beginning to move it, I'll stop and you'll take . over. Do you understand? Leonard, of course, cannot say whether he does or not. The look on his face is "thoughtful." The look on Sayer's, hopeful and foolish. 
 I'm beginning . . . The pointer begins to slowly move past stars and moons. Judging from Sayer's expression he begins to feel Leonard's movement of it and, presumably, stops his own. 
 Yes, good . . . The pointer moves across the letters, but passes the "L" without stopping. It stops on the "R." 
 No. No, I didn't make myself clear. My fault. I . . .     . The pointer begins moving again, "interrupting" Sayer.      It passes the "L" again, reaches the "I" and stops. ..

 Yes. Yes. That's what I meant. . "L." Good. Now the "E." It begins moving again. But not to the "E." To the nK," where it hesitates briefly before moving again. 
 (realizing, to himself) . . . you're spelling something el e . . . s Keeping one hand on the moving pointer, Sayer fumbles a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on his lab coat what Leonard has and is continuing to "write": 
 
 He has to study it only a moment before he sees the meaning of it; he quickly scratches out the last four letters,and adds a slash between the "S" and the "P," so that it reads: R I L K E s/p A N T H E R     BmBJUP*

 There's an ordinary medicine with which we are all familiar. An everyday medicine of stubbed toes and bunions and boils. A man at a podium in a modern version of the 1920's basement operating theatre. · , 
 And then there is another kind. A medicine that holds out to the afflicted the promise of restored life. He glances to a point above his listeners, and an overhead projector splashes a diagram of molecular structure (and the silhouette of a raised hand) onto a screen. The neurochemist traces the shadow to its maker in the audience. 
 Thank you. Yes. Yes, I'm very much interested in your work with this drug. I'm curious if . . . 
 Doctor ...? 
 (pause) Sayer. I'm curious if you . . . 
 After I'm through, Dr. Sayer.      If you wouldn't mind. Sayer glances around the auditorium. Everyone's looking at him. He grasps the offending hand and holds it in his lap with the other. 
 O.S. Do you   think it's possible that simple   Parkinsonian tremor taken to its   furthest extreme could appear   as no tremor at all? When no one answers, the chemist glances over his shoulder. Sayer is there, quite alone, looking at him. 
 Are you speaking to me? Sayer is. And really wants to know the answer. The chemist zips up and moves to the sinks to wash his hands. 
 If jail the compulsions in the Parkinson's patient were somehow . accelerated - (demonstrating what he means) - the hands, the shaking, the tics, the head bobbing, the quickening speech - (he's become a mass       » of tics and accelerated speech) - might they not cave in on themselves and, in effect, turn the person into stone? He comes to a abrupt stop, his eyes transfixed like a post- encephalitic's, staring. The chemist slowly dries his hands with a paper towel. 
 Dr. Sayer, yes? (Sayer nods) I'm a chemist, doctor. I leave it to you guys to do the damage. He drops the paper towel into the trash and leaves 
 Freud believed in miracles. Prescribing cocaine like it was candy . . . Sayer has to hurry to keep up with his supervisor as he heads toward the hospital. 
 We all believed in the "miracle" of Cortisone until our patients went psychotic on it. Now it's L-Dopa. He hands over the papers - xeroxed articles from medical journals and newspapers which Sayer gave him to read - and keeps going, Sayer straggling a few steps back. 
 With all due respect, I think it's rather too soon to say that. : 
 With all due "respect," it's rather way too soon. Let the chemists do the damage. The gap between them widens as Sayer slows. He expected this sort of reaction from Kaufman, but had hoped for another. Kaufman disappears into the building. 
 Did you read the case - the husband who came home to find his wife singing. She hadn't felt like singing in years. Kaufman, on the phone, glances to Sayer long-sufferingly, lets him wait while he finishes with his call, and eventually sets down the receiver. 
 What I believe, what I know, is that these people are alive inside. 
 How do you know? Because they catch tennis balls? 
 I know it. Sayer doesn't elaborate, but his tone is resolute. And it has the intended effect on Kaufman, causing him to consider the possibility that Sayer could, somehow, know it as a fact. 
 r..iiJi!                And what if this drug were to kill them? 
 - (right back)              > And what if this drug were to cure them? Somewhere behind Kaufman's eyes Sayer can see, he thinks, a change, or reminiscence, long ago, long buried, of things he once believed or wanted to believe. 
 How many did you think I ' d let you put on it? 
 All of them ... some of them ... one of them . . . 
 One. With the family's consent. Signed. Sayer tries to hide his elation and turns to leave before Kaufman changes his mind. 
 That "immense" project of yours. The myelin? The worms? When that failed, what was the reaction of your lab supervisor?                                  · Sayer thinks about lying, but senses Kaufman knows the answer         * already and just wants to hear him say it. So he does: 
 He asked me to leave.   . Kaufman nods like, Just checking. And - 
                     . Good luck. Sayer leaves. 
 People with ordinary Parkinson's Disease sometimes complain that they've "lost their grace . . . " (he picks up a cup with a shaking hand) They have to think about the things we just do . . . (with great "trouble" he sets it down) It has to do with a chemical in the midbrain, or rather the lack of it, called dopamine. L-Dopa replenishes this dopamine, making it possible for these patients to move more naturally. He picks up the cup again, gracefully, and sets it down. 
 MRS. LOWE Leonard has Parkinson's Disease?

 You are here. She ponders that and the enormity of the whole situation, all the while staring at the consent form. 
 I have no idea. What do you say we ease into it with ... what, »      . fifty milligrams? Ray begins to measure five milligrams. 
 Let's say a hundred. Ray shrugs; it's okay with him. He knifes at the powder, removing all but 100 milligrams. 
 Leonard? Your mother's going to give you some juice. There's medicine in it which is why it may taste more bitter than usual. Sayer glances to Mrs. Lowe. It's as if they've rehearsed it all. She holds the glass to her son's lips and gradually drains the liquid down his throat. Nothing immediately happens, of course, but they all, with the exception of Leonard, look as if they expect it to. Mrs. Lowe hands the empty glass back to Sayer. And they all wait. 
 Maybe the acid in the orange juice, neutralized it.

 Yes, I'll call. They nod "good night" atT each other and Miss Costello leaves. Sayer slumps into Leonard's wheelchair. lAnd waits. 
 It's quiet. 
 It's late.    Everyone's asleep·> 
 I'm not asleep? 
 No.   You're awake. Though he nods, it's unclear whether Leonard realizes how significant that is. Sayer gestures at the piece of paper beneath Leonard's hands. 
 May I? Sayer draws the paper across the table. It's covered with what seems imponderable hieroglyphic-like scrawl. But there is order in the chaos. Letters. Leonard's name. 
 Me. 
 O.S. Leonard? Leonard turns to Sayer's voice with an expression of child-like       , wonder on his face. 
 Your mother is here. She appears in the doorway of the room. She's done her hair, her face, she's put on a nice dress, yet she remains unprepared for this reunion. She can do nothing but stare at her "infant son" who is now, "suddenly," a man. As he slowly crosses toward her, she is struck by the fact she must look u£ in order to meet his eyes. He reaches her. Reaches out to her. And she embraces him. 
 My name is Elizabeth. It's a » pleasure to meet you. Leonard, standing, reaches for her hand and struggles to pronounce her name correctly. Fighting to keep from crying in front of him, Miss Costello glances to Sayer and Mrs. Lowe. 
 How do you do, sir? My name is Margaret. 
 Margaret. 
 Fernando. How are you? 
 Great, man. How're you? 
 Great, too. 
 How do you do, Mr. Lowe? 
 ! Good, sir. 
 It's delicious. 
 I wouldn't go that far, Len. Sayer and Miss Costello, at another table, glance over to the others who are all laughing. Sayer smiles. 
 I don't think I could deal with losing 3D years of my life. I can't even imagine it. 
 He does realize it, doesn't he? Sayer nods uncertainly. 
 He must. 
 Splendid. Sayer makes a note. They are alone in the examination room which, like most of the hospital, has little in it to indicate that it is not the 1930's. 
 Can I see you walk the length of the room?                        * Leonard walks slowly across the room past the perception tests and notes and Polaroids cluttering the wall. Coming back, he pauses. He's looking at a picture of himself taped there. Sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel his features. He stares at the photograph of himself, trying to comprehend that which cannot be comprehended. He's not younjg anymore. 98. 98.   OMITTED 99.   INT.

 . . . you'll sleep. And when you wake up in the morning, it will be the next morning. I promise. Sayer's smile tries to assure them both that it will happen just that way. He excuses himself, leaving Leonard with his mother, joins Miss Costello by the door and glances back. Mrs. Lowe is stroking Leonard's head as she hums a lullaby. 
 I didn't sleep, did you? 
 Does it look like it?                   . Sayer hangs up his jacket and slips into a lab coat. 
 Do you know if Leonard's awake? v She smiles and points toward the adjoining examination room. 
 Good morning.     . His speech is still rather flat, halting., 
 Been waiting for me long? 
 Yes. 
 Some things have happened while you've been away. I thought you'd be interested. Leonard opens one carefully, reverently, and begins reading from it to himself. 
 You don't have to read them now, Leonard. They're yours. At your leisure. Leonard closes the book but holds onto it and the others like they're gold. 
 I used to read quite a lot. . Before. SAYER i Yes, I know.      . 
 Thank you for these. i                       . Sayer nods that he's welcome. 
 Have you thought about what you'd like to do today? 
 Everything. 
 (smiles) I'm not sure I can arrange that. 
 Try. Sayer smiles again. For a man who just yesterday learned he has been cheated out of the greater"- part of his life, Leonard seems to have recovered extraordinarily. 
 Let's approach it this way. What              . ". x             do you think you'd like to do                    . 1J              first?                                       ..·

 Yeah. Well, five years ago.                                 , Sayer shrugs, disappears into the kitchen a moment . . . before            ; peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now: a small             i framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn expression posed in front of a curtain; the boat obviously a photography studio prop. 
 Your son? 
 Me, actually. '      ,,"                     t 
 (looking closely at                              ' the photograph) You seem uncomfortable. 
 I probably was. Sayer disappears into the kitchen again. And a moment later . glances back in around the door frame at Leonard who has moved over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are neatly arranged.                   · /· 
 Each has a specific purpose. 
 Those are my normal interior glasses. And spare pair. Those, I wear outside. Two pairs, in case I los.e one. Those, those are my daytime reading glasses. And spare. Those are for close work. For fine print. Those are my nighttime reading glasses - 
 That's heavy-gauge metal so when I fall asleep and roll over on them I don't wreck them. They're indestructible. Leonard returns the indestructible ones to their proper place and considers them all together. 
 As long as I pretty much know ahead of time what I'll be looking ' at, it works out, I don't have to carry all five pairs around. 
 What if you just want to go for a walk? 
 (pause) Walks are a problem. Walks are the hardest thing. You just never know. He's absolutely serious, like a man plagued for years by an imponderable dilemma. He retreats back into his kitchen before reappearing again with the pot of tea, two mismatched cups and some saltine% on a tray. 
 I hope you'll forgive the inelegant presentation. I don't entertain much.       ·/·       . 
 I can date my interest in science precisely, actually. I'd been                                   * sent off to boarding school - a place perhaps not quite as Dickensian as I remember it - when I happened to come across the periodic table of elements. (smiles at the thought) I memorized it. Which I admit was a rather precocious thing for a seven year old to do. And I remember feeling . . . not so much a sense of accomplishment . . . as comfort. The halogens were what they were. The alkali metals were what they were. Each element had its place, and nothing could                                    * change that. They were secure, no                               * matter what.                                                    * Leonard nods, perhaps more out of politeness than                      * understanding. Sayer nods too, feeling, perhaps, a little             * exposed. 
 : You're not married. * It seems to Sayer a non sequitor.                                        * 
 No. He smiles. Sips his tea. Silence except for the ticking of a           * clock somewhere. Then, very matter of factly - 
 I'm not terribly good with people. I like them. I wish I could say I had more than a rudimentary understanding of them. (pause) Maybe if they were less unpredictable . . . He shrugs. Silence again. 
 Eleanor would disagree with you.                                * Sayer stares at him blankly. He doesn't seem to know who "Eleanor11 is.                                .                            *

 What'd she say?

 We should be getting back. Sayer crosses over to the sideboard, to the pairs of glasses, stares at them for several moments, and picks up two pairs. 114.

Nurses and orderlies and office workers at tables with finished' meals and cups of coffee. They seem unaware of Drs. Sayer and Kaufman at a table near the door.

 <D                        To put them all on the dosage Mr. Lowe is on . . . about twenty thousand dollars. Kaufman stares at Sayer aghast. He knew L-Dopa was expensive, but not that expensive. He manages to recover somewhat. 
 That would be for how long? 
 About a month. 
 A month? Sayer nods. Kaufman glances away.   Stares blankly at faces at other tables. Back to Sayer. 
 I can't go before the board with that. I could . . . 
 I was thinking of speaking to the patrons. 
 The few patrons this hospital has give what they can. 
 Well, we'd have to convince them to give more than they*re accustomed to giving. 
 Perhaps if they saw Mr. Lowe. . .;. ·· -; '     ..'·' ' : '. :..;. .,.-, '    ·'    "'    · ·' ·: 
 I think you overestimate the effect Mr. Lowe has on people. We're talking about money here. Kaufman sips at his coffee and slowly becomes aware   of the silence around them. No one is talking. He glances    up as Miss Costello walks by setting something on the table in   front of him. She leaves the cafeteria without a word. 
 O.S. There was extreme rigidity of the axial musculature . . . only vague available motion in the neck . . . no voluntary movement in the limbs . . . A tight shot of Leonard's entranced face appears on the screen. 
 O.S. Perhaps most striking was the profound facial masking -- which we now know should not have been confused with apathy.         * Tight on Sayer, the light from the projector flickering on his face. 
 Virtually aphonic, Mr. Lowe could articulate no words, but rather only, with considerable effort, an occasional noise, a kind of, "h .. . " A                                      · In the darkness sit Kaufman, the rest of the Board of Directors, some elderly patrons of the hospital, and, near Sayer, Miss Costello. She hands him a scribbled note. "Less scientific" it reads. 
 Isolated circumstances -- the mention of his name, notes of particular pieces of music, the touch of another human being -- managed on occasion to briefly summon him, but these awakenings were rare and transient, lasting only a moment or two. Sayer glances to Miss Costello.   She nods, "Good, that's better." 
 The rest of the time he remained in a profoundly eventless place ~ deprived of all sense of history and happening and self -- encysted, cocooned, enveloped in this metaphorical if not physiological equivalent of sleep . . . or death. Tight on the screen, on Leonard, as he was. Looking more like a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one. 
 This was his condition when first seen by me in a remote bay of this hospital. And the quality of his life for the last 30 years. The "before picture" of Leonard on the screen is replaced with the "after" -- his eyes alert, his hands exploring a desk microphone. He glances up and off at something.

 LEONARD (FILM) My name is Leonard Lowe. It has been explained to me that I have been away for . . . quite some time . . . He seems to withdraw, to wrestle with the thought, to try to somehow come to terms with it, to somehow resolve it. He nods as he finds within himself some source of strength and looks directly at the camera. 
 LEONARD (FILM) I'm back. 
 They're volunteers from the   : neighborhood.

Sayer knows better than to sit and wait, that nothing is going to immediately happen, but he sits and waits anyway. As does Miss Costello. As does Leonard and his mother. 
 Dr. Sayer? Sayer wakes to find a night nurse standing over him. 
 What is it? 
 It's a miracle.

A cacophony   of off-screen voices - from a radio, the television,   and the awakened post-encephalitics themselves - rises up as   another woman, Miriam, moves past Lucy's face. We follow her,   as does a nurse with a blood pressure guage on wheels.                                    , 
 (interrupting) I've been sitting for 25 years, you missed your chance. Miriam and the nurse trailing after her pass in front of a man * with no English (Josef) trying to explain something to a couple of orderlies. One to the other -   . ORDERLY 1 You're Italian, he's Italian, what's the problem? ORDERLY 2 I was born here - X don't speak · Italian. Nearby, another man. This one does speak English - 
 I want a steak, rare. I want mashed potatoes and gravy, string beans, a slice of pie and a   ' chocolate phosphate. Anthony turns away with the tray he just brought in - broth, jello and juice - and carries it away, passing the "card playing nurse," Margaret. 
 I think I prefer them the other way. Having settled on Margaret: she smiles, glances to "her" patient, Rose, who, staring at her reflection in a hand mirror, tugs at her grey hair. ROSE And some dye. Black. 
 (jotting down the request) Black, are you sure? ROSE And some clothes . . . my. clothes.

 We'll find them for you.     We'll track them down. Lucy again, Sayer still at her side. 
 . . . I called to my sister, but she couldn't hear me. No one could hear me. I was alone . . . (pause) And then I woke up. She smiles. Sayer tries to. He hesitates ... but finally can't help asking her -                                                · 
 Lucy, what year is it? 
 What year is it? You don't know? He shakes his head 'no.' She glances around the place, then leans close to him and whispers -

 I walked all the way over there. And back. What a perfect day. The group at the doorway applauds, and it CARRIES OVER:

 Hi.        i He smiles and crosses toward her, but by the time he reaches her the smile has disappeared. Something troubling has occurred to him. He glances to Sayer and whispers -- 
 Is it real . . . or . . . 
              : 
 O.S. . . . the Mighty Mets stormed 11 their locker room shortly after nine o'clock on their night to remember - He moves toward the voice, traces it to a crafts area, where a young woman is reading from the sports page to an older man tied to his wheelchair. Though it's doubtful the man is even aware of her presence, she reads to him as if her were, and in the process, draws Leonard into the sound of her words until there are no sounds but her words: 
 "Released from bondage and ridicule after seven destitute seasons, they raised the roof of Shea Stadium - while their fans attempted to dismantle it - in one of the loudest, wildest victory celebrations in baseball     : history - "         ._ The reverie is suddenly shattered, the real sounds of the hospital rising back up, as Sidney, wild with excitement, bangs through the far doors of the corridor. He sprints past the crafts area, past Leonard, runs the entire length of the corridor, and - 
 Hi. 
 Is it real ... or . . . 
 As real as real can be. Sidney lowers himself to his knees before Lolly and, weeping * quietly, rests his head on her lap. She strokes his head. 
 Len - come on. Leonard steps into the elevator, the last one in. 
 MRS. LOWE Sidney's going. 
 He's a patient, Mom.

 MRS. LOWE C -j               He's not the same kind of patient. 
 He's still a patient.       You're not a patient. 
 MRS. LOWE I'm your mother. Inside the bus, Miriam, anxious to leave, leans over the driver to honk the horn. Leonard kisses his mother on the cheek and turns away. 
 MRS. LOWE Wait a minute. (he turns back) What on earth have you done to your hair? He's parted it, apparently, on the "wrong" side. She pulls a comb from her purse, recombs it "correctly," straightens his jacket lapels and steps back.                          ' 
 MRS. LOWE There. 
 There's your bus.                . The public bus, behind her, coming down the street. As she hurries to the corner, Sayer climbs down off the hospital bus. 
 Ready? * 
 I've decided not to go. He waves to his mother. Sayer stares at him. 
 I'm staying here. 
 Why? What's wrong? 
 Nothing. Wave. He waves again to his mother; she's boarding the public bus. Sayer does as he's told, waves too. Impatient, Miriam honks the horn again. 
 '(_J)               Let's go, already. 
 I'll see you later, have a good time. He climbs the hospital steps and disappears inside, Sayer staring after him. Miriam honks the horn again, and he climbs aboard. The doors hiss shut and driver turns to him. 
 Where to? Sayer suddenly realizes he has no idea "where to." He glances over his shoulder at the expectant faces of the patients, all dressed up with nowhere to go. It's up to him . . . His face brightens; he's thought of a good place. 
 (calling) Dr. Sayer? 
 It's very hard to keep everyone together, doctor. 
 Has someone wandered off? 
 You.

 I'm kidding. I'm sorry. I saw you upstairs . . . just now. Leonard nods without looking at her.

 No.                                 ·

 I've always loved tide pools, haven't you? Anthony doesn't answer. He seems troubled. 
 What is it? 
 You chose this place? (Sayer nods) Why? 
 (pause)                        , I come here all the time. 
 Why? 
 They are. Sayer, taken aback, glances back to Anthony, whose look says, There you go. 
 I ' d thought about the opera house. Do you think they'd prefer that? 
 The opera house? 
 The Botanical Gardens? Anthony looks to Miss Costello and rolls his eyes.

 Oh, they'll be angry. What're they going to do, fire me? He doesn't realize she's not asking him. He has to shrug that he doesn't know.

 Bye. 
 Thanks for talking to me.            · She steps away toward the door. 
 He knows. 
 ·         Your father. He knows you visit him. Whether he's saying it just to be nice doesn't matter to her. It's what she wants to believe. She smiles gratefully. * 
 I'll see you. She leaves. 
 Not that I know of. I kind of doubt it. Rose gets up and crosses toward Sayer. Seeing her coming, he smiles ... but the smile slowly begins to fade as she sings to him: ROSE You made me love you I didn't want to do it               · I didn't want to do it . . . Singing as she does it, she pulls him out of his chair. Embarrassed, he resists, but she finally gets on the dance floor. Never more mortified in his life (it seems as if everyone is watching) he "dances . . . " And the band finishes the song.             ' 
                                      " Everybody have a good time? Leonard doesn't wait for the answer, returns to his typing. Sayer comes closer. 
 What are you doing? He peers over Leonard's shoulder to read what he's typing, and a slow smile crosses his face. 
 V.O. "One - typewriters and writing supplies in all dayrooms at all times . . . 
                  ; " . . . Two - music and dance classes for those patients who desire them. Three - technical courses for those who wish to learn a trade. Four - patients' grievance committees. Five - the same food in the patients' cafeteria as in the staff's. Six . . . " and I happen to think this is an excellent idea, "the establishment of a permanent hospital library. And "Seven - televisions that work." 
 "Respectfully, Leonard Lowe." -- and listens to the silence.    It's a long one. 
 What is this place? 
 It's your library. Sayer pulls down another sheet and more light spills in. 
 It'll take some fixing up     » obviously. A thorough cleaning to begin with. Some desks. Books                · of course. Leonard's glance slowly moves across the dim room, settling finally on Sayer, who's smiling. 
 They agreed to find the money for it. And to my suggestion that you oversee it and select the books. 
 Me? 
 He's still hasn't talked? 
 We think he got sick before he learned how to talk. 
 To talk with words. Close on two nurses, across the room. 
 1 She's the daughter of the nephew of a Dutch archduke. She's royalty. She's referring to Magda, who glances over as if sensing they're talking about her. They drop their voices: 
                               · He's dead, this duke? 
 1 He's been dead a hundred years. 
 Then forget it, I'm not curtsying. Lucy, wearing "stylish" new glasses, smiles as Sayer listens to her heartbeat through a stethoscope. Satisfied with it, he makes a notation in her chart. 
 Can I have your hand? 
                 \ Yes, you can have my hand. (she holds it out to him) Take me away from this place.                           . He smiles uneasily. 
 I'm your doctor, Lucy. 
 You're my Prince Charming. Close on hands rapidly dealing 3-Card Monte. The cards eventually settle, and the hand of someone else hesitates over them before gingerly tapping one. As it's turned over: ORDERLY There it is. The orderly snaps his finger in triumph. The 3-Card Monte dealer, a dextrous encephalitic, shrugs.

 How's it going, Frank? Frank glances blankly at Anthony and another orderly, who are hanging out nearby with Bert, passing around a Road & Track magazine. 
 How's it "going?" 
 How do you feel? 
 How do I feel? (pause) My parents are dead. My wife is       I in an institution. My son has disappeared ... "Out West" somewhere. (pause) I feel old and I feel swindled, that's how I feel. Anthony glances at the others with a why-did-I-ask kind of look. Frank wanders away.

 MRS. LOWE It's a bit ridiculous all this girl business, don't you think? A grown man like him? She looks to Sayer for confirmation.        Sayer manages a nod. 
 MRS. LOWE You know what he said? I should take a vacation. I should go away for a few days and "relax." 
 MRS. LOWE          ^ I can't leave him alone in this place. He'd die without me. Sayer "agrees" with a sympathetic nod, but suspects it is she who would die if she left. She resumes pacing, and mutters to herself the bitter-tasting word:

 SAYER'S VOICE What kind of things? 
 Things that matter. Things that have happened to me. Things I've cone to understand. Things. 
 Where are you calling from? 
 LEONARD'S VOICE Your office. SAYER                      i It's very late, Leonard. 
 LEONARD'S VOICE Is it? Sayer nods to himself that it is. That fact and that Leonard has apparently felt compelled to call him to discuss "things" concerns him.                          : 
 Stay there. I'm coming over.

 I ' m thankful, but what I need now isn't here. .    .   .   . Silence. And, eventually, since no one else asks it: 
 Where is it?                      : 
 · There. Kaufman and Sayer and the others follow Leonard's gesture to * the windows. 
 * Mr. Lowe, I ' m sorry, I ' m afraid I don't understand. What is it                                        * you want now?                                                       * 
 The simplest thing. 
 (somehow doubting it will be simple) And what is that? 
 I want to know that I'm free to go for a walk, if I feel like it. Like any normal person. The board members glance among themselves.         They seem relieved. {V   That is a simple request. 
 I am? (Kaufman's shrug says "of course") Alone? Now there's a pause. And Leonard's hand makes a gesture to his * face, to his brow. He ignores it (or is unaware of it).        * 
 What difference does that make? 
 (pause) I think you know. 
 I don't know. Tell me. 
 (right back) It makes all the difference. He brushes at his brow again. Sayer studies him, or rather the tic itself as it repeats. 
          -                            * You didn't wake a thing, you woke                       * a person. I ' m a person.     »                         * 
 Mr. Lowe? I wonder . . . are you at all aware of the unconscious hostility you're exhibiting towards us right now?                                   * Kaufman glances over to the psychiatrist, weary. The look on * Leonard's face is complete innocence; and his tone completely * without innuendo - 
 How could I be aware of something that's unconscious?              * Sayer smiles to himself. So does Kaufman. The psychiatrist * doesn't.                                                  ** 
 I 'm curious . . . I can tell this is important to you but I ' m not sure why. What would you do if you went out? 
 (his patience straining) I ' m hot you. Enlighten me. 
 I ' d walk around. I ' d talk to people, I ' d look at things. I' d decide whether I wanted to go this way, or that way, or keep going straight. I ' d do the things you do everyday and take for granted. Long silence. Then: 
 I'll tell you what, we'll take it under consideration. We'll let you know. 
 Yeah, I was aware of it.     · (the tic) I was nervous. It's nothing. What'd they say? 
 They said it's a dangerous place out there. They said they can't be held responsible for what might happen to you out there. They said no. Leonard nods, sips his coffee, seems to take the decision in stride. 
 And what did you say? 
 They don't have to listen to me. 
 Did you agree with them? 
 (pause) Yes. Leonard nods again, philosophically it seems. 
 I ' m not sure we're out of the woods yet, Leonard. I'm not sure this is nothing. (the tic) I have to be sure you're well. There'll be time enough - Leonard gets up out of his chair -- 
 Bye. -- and turns to leave. 
 Leonard ... Leonard ignores him and walks out --      : 
 Where are you going? 
 For a walk. 
 Leonard . . . Leonard ignores him. 
 Leonard . . . Leonard disappears around a corner. Sayer veers off to a hospital phone and picks it up. Into it - 
 This is Dr. Sayer . . . 
 Let go of him. The orderlies don't know what to do. They're just trying to restrain Leonard but he's making it almost impossible. 
 Leonard, stop fighting. He keeps fighting. He can see the outside through the glass doors, so close, so far. 
 Let ao of him.                                      . They pull him back, away from the doors, into the corridor -w behind them.         . 
 MRS. LOWE O.S. I don't understand it, he was never any trouble before. Kaufman, too, is there, and Miss Costello. Kaufman watches            * Sayer. 
 MRS. LOWE He was quiet: and polite and respectful. He never demanded anything. He was never disobedient. 
 He was catatonic, Mrs. Lowe. He seems to say it more for Kaufman's benefit; regardless, she doesn't care for his tone. 
 MRS. LOWE I'm speaking of when he was a boy. 
 (REV.11/22/89)CHERRY 
 MRS. LOWE (to Kaufman) He was always nice-minded when he was a boy.                    ^ Kaufman nods, studies Sayer. 
 MRS. LOWE I don't know who that is up there. I don't think he knows. (to Sayer) You've turned Leonard into something he is not. 
 This is a mistake. It's wrong and it's cruel and it should never have happened like this - but you have to understand - nothing quite like this has happened before, no one knows what to do . . . Leonard, please don't ignore me. Leonard condescends a look to him. A moment and Sayer smiles at a thought:                        , 
 I wish you could just walk out like that. I wish it were that simple. 
 Wake up. 167-163. OMITTED                                                167-169 169A-. INT. ELEVATOR & CORRIDOR                                 169A. The elevator door slides open revealing an orderly with several * trays of untouched food on a cart. Kaufman steps in and the door slides shut. Descending: ORDERLY I guess they're not hungry. Kaufman nods distractedly, not really listening. The orderly begins whistling a tune to himself. Kaufman glances over long- sufferingly, quieting him. The door slides open, and the young man wheels the cart past Kaufman. Finally:                     ~ 
 Who? ORDERLY Ward 5. The door slides shut. 
 It isn't us that's defective, it's them. We're not in crisis, they are. We've been through the worst that can happen to a person and survived it. They haven't. They fear it. And they hide from their fear by hiding us, because they know, they know . . . The men wa it for the rest, but L eonard loses his tra in of t ho ugh t. F ru str at ed, h is t ics r es urf ac e and ela bor at e. H e seems unaware of them. To one of the men:                             . 
 How long have you been here?            * (the man shrugs) You don't know? A month, a year?               . sj^                  (he doesn't know) (^7             Whv are you here? He doesn't know that, either. To another patient: 
                - How do you feel being locked up? 
 WARD 5 PATIENT I don't like it. 
 You don't like it? Aren't you an animal? 
 WARD 5 PATIENT I'm no animal. 
 Then why are you in a cage? The man's getting agitated . . . they all are. Leonard stops pacing, faces them, and almost whispers: 
 Anger . . . 
 That's what you feel ... anger! The men erupt in a burst of noisy approval; they cone alive. Tight on Kaufman on the other side of the "cage," watching. And, over the din - 
 V.O. He's lived for thirty years in abjection and defeat . . . 
 - He's lived for thirty years without the ability to release his anger - 
 - So have the others - 
 I happen to think his behavior's                      . more natural than theirs - KAUFMAN              t Really - and his tics and paranoia? They're more natural - ; 
 He's in that place. 
 Oh, is that it - 
 We wake him up, then lock him up,                 » that's not "paranoia," that's a fact. 
 I've got 20 psychotics up there, "doctor," refusing to eat. They have no idea whv they're refusing to eat. How long should I let that go (on) - 
 He knows why, hs. wants out. 
 Mr. Lowe is not the Messiah of Ward 5, he's a man in trouble. He wasn't "resurrected," he was administered a drug - by. you - that's fallen somewhat short of its "miraculous" reputation - 
      . The others are fine, they show no signs of - 
 He's been OQ it longer! Sayer has no rejoinder. A silence before: 
              . I sympathize with him. I've tried to accommodate him. But                       . I will not let him endanger the health of other patients. He's resolute; it feels like a threat, or ultimatum. Trying t remain calm, Sayer changes tacks - 
 I'll talk to him, I'll      explain t he problem. He'll listen       to (m e) - (Kaufman has to laugh) Without the drug, he's    dead. Th e sta teme nt do esn 't hav e qui te the p owe r Saye r may h av hoped. At least not on Kaufman. His eyes seem to go dead . . and then the slightest, slightest shrug. 
 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. 
 WARD 5 PATIENT We can't allow it. Leonard, across the room, pacing slowly, glances over. 
 He's all right. Leonard's "bodyguards" step aside. Sayer crosses to Leonard and is greeted in a tone precisely that of master to servant, very courteous yet unmistalcably condescending: 
 How are you today? 
 I'm all right, how are you? 
 Never better. A strange gesture, a tic, appears and repeats. 
 And these gentlemen? » "CONTINUED: 
 Someone wants to hurt you? (no answer) Who? Leonard glances at Sayer with a slight knowing smile. '. . 
 That's the thing, isn't it, you never know who. Someone I least expect, I expect. Look at history. 
 Every patient in this ward thinks there's a plot against him, Leonard. 
 Yeah, well they're mistaken, they're crazy. j                 .. * The smile that appears this time on Leonard's face is as insane as anything Sayer's ever seen. He hesitates. Then: 
 Something's wrong. 
 Hey, buddy.                                     . 
                                               * The drug's not working. These are                             * side-effects and they're consuming                            * you, and if we don't do -                                     * 
 Hey, I appreciate you coming to see me, I have some things to do. Leonard abruptly extends his hand; it's a little twisted.              * Sayer doesn't so much shake the hand as hold onto it. 
 Look at yourself, Leonard. r Leonard tries to pull his hand away, but Sayer's grasp is               * stronger. 
 Look at yourself - 
            * Disease took mjs out of the world, I fought to come back, I failed for 30 years but at least I fought, look at you. But Sayer is looking at him, moving back and forth against the bars on a window, panther-like. He retaliates: 
 The medicine can be taken away.                               .' That can be done. You. can wake up                             " in the morning and it won't be there. The remarks seem to have no effect on Leonard. He seems not to ' have heard them. But as Sayer takes a step closer, Leonard, * without warning, lunges.                                        * Sayer stumbles back and his glasses fall to the floor. He . ' scrambles to his feet, leaving them, and backs away from     * * Leonard's bodyguards who are slowly coming toward.him. Orderlies get the cage unlocked and hustle Sayer out. As it * slams shut again, he glances back in at Leonard, and hardly * ,    * recognizes him. 
 O.S. How are the others? Sayer turns to the voice, to Leonard, a ticcing figure in shadow hunched in a corner of the dayroom. 
 Scared. 
 (pause) They want you back. I want you back.                         * 
 I want to be back. 
 He's aware of his appearance. He's less concerned with it than he is with the effect it may have on the rest of us.                                       . He waits for the patients to acknowledge they understand. They nod. 
 We'll be working with his dosage. He's aware of this, too, and says he's prepared for it. He wants us. to be prepared for it. 
             : 
 Welcome back. 
 Thanks. The others come over, shake his hand and pat him on the back,             * but all a little too gently, too concerned, like he might break. Leonard manages a smile. 
 I' m all right. The others nod quickly in agreement. And the room falls into               * silence. 
                       . Only it's too quiet in here. 
 "You build me up, Buttercup,                           " Only to let me down ... "   v It's like    a cocktail party - everybody dressed up, some singing,    some milling around talking. Leonard tries to enjoy it, too,    struggling to contain,, to hide from the others, the tics that    are trying to "come out."

In front of it, Leonard seated in a chair, his hands performing repertoires of tics. He seems wholly unbothered by them. 
 LEONARD (CONT'D) . . . some are new . . . some are      * elaborations . . . some are counter- tics. They don't bother me. What bothers me is that I know they shouldn't be there . . . One of his hands makes a movement to his ear, to his pants, to his ear again, like some bizarre genuflection. 
 This is new . . . ·   ' 
 V.O. (flat) There's no sense of time. It's like being caught between mirrors . . . or echoes . . . Tight on his face, his eyes, transfixed. 
 V.O. Something has to happen ... A cockroach runs across the paper and Leonard's eyes "wake up" and his hand finishes the word, " F L O W E R S " 
 LEONARD (CONT'D) It's not that it feels bad, it's, nothing, I feel nothing. Like I'm nothing. Like I ' m dead.

 I ' d love to see it. 
 It's here somewhere . . . As he hunts for it amidst all the notes, his hands and head begin shaking. The hands seize on some other papers and, hard as he tries, he can't make himself let go of them. The pages crumple. 
 It's all right, I'll see it some other -                                              i He's interrupted as Leonard suddenly goes into an severe oculogyric crisis, his head thrusting back -

 Good. Leonard sits. He seems fine. Suddenly his hand jerks up and catches the tennis ball Sayer has thrown. 
 Good. The ball, without warning, comes back. Sayer lunges at it, but misses. It hits his wrist and rolls across the floor. 
 Well, I wasn't ready, was I. Leonard smiles. Sayer smiles. They're both so relieved, they can hardly believe it. It seems they're out of the woods, that they've found the "middle ground." Tight on Leonard's pharmaceutical chart on the desk. Sayer's hand comes in and boldly underlines the, dosage - 575 MGS. 
 MRS. LOWE                      . Here, let me. 
 No, I can do it. She watches him try to get the tie on by himself, and casts around, feeling, perhaps, without a purpose. Eventually, more to herself than to him: 
 MRS. LOWE What you see in that girl . . . (she trails off) I don't get it. 
 MRS. LOWE What? (no answer) You're not talking to yourself* again. 
 Yeah. 
 MRS. LOWE You shouldn't do that, you know. 
 I know. She watches him struggle with the tie a moment more. Finally,        * she can't bear it any longer, and reaches to do it for him.          *

 O.S. What if he's just had enough of it? Sayer glances to Magda, nearby with a group of other patients, some of them looking off toward the sunroom where Leonard, alone, at a window, stares out. 
 What if it's just a matter of time for all of us? 
 : There's no reason to think any of this will happen to you. You're individuals. And you're all well. (pause) Aren't you? Most nod, but it's without great conviction. 
 He's the strongest of us. Close on Lucy/ across the room with Miss Costello, finishing the song:

 MRS. LOWE But when he got sick, you can bet I asked why. I demanded to know why. Why was this happening? Silence. Then with an almost philosophical shrug: 
 MRS. LOWE There was nothing I could do about it. There was no one I could go to and say, "Stop this, please stop this, can't you see my son is in pain?" 
 He's fighting, Mrs - 
 MRS. LOWE He's losing.

 I've let the others down.

 Look at me. 
 ^      197.CONT. He is a man consumed by illness. With a voice that is flat and \f) w*    limbs that are bent and hands that are twisted and a grimace that can only hint at the great depth of the despair he is suffering. 
 Look at me and tell me I am not. 
 You are not. It's over and Leonard knows it. And though he won't admit it, so does Sayer. Leonard barely gets the words out -»- 
 This . . . isn't . . . me.

 .. I worked . . . I had friends (p             over . . . I went dancing . . . that's about it . . . Leonard, ticcing, nods, smiles through his grimace, imagining those things. 
 I know, I should do something with my life.          · 
 Like what? Those are great things. I've never done any of those things. 
 You will. Leonard shakes his nead 'no.' 
 They'll never let me out of this place. They shouldn't. They consider each other for several moments -- the one, young and healthy; the other, old and ill. 
 I'm not well. I feel well inside when I see you. I wish you could see what's inside. Instead of this. 
 I can see it. Silence. As much as Leonard wants to say "I love you," he knows he cannot, that it would be ludicrous. Instead: 
 Goodbye.                          · He ho lds out o ne of his sh aking han ds to her. S he reach es to it, places her hand on it, holds it, and the shaking slowly, slowly, slowly begins to subside. She lifts him gently out of his wheelchair and leads him away    * from the table. She arranges his arms in such a way that he is sort of holding her and begins to slowly dance with him.

 L EONARD (FILM )      . (T~^\             My name is Leonard Lowe. It has been explained to me that I have been away for quite some time. Tight on Sayer,- alone in the darkened room, watching the footage, watching Leonard wrestling with the thought. 
 LEONARD (FILM) I'm back. Light moves across the screen. Someone has entered. Miss Costello. She exchanges a long glance with Sayer before they both look back to the screen. 
 LEONARD (FILM) I thought it was a dream at first. Silence except for the sound of the projector.   Then - SAYER'S VOICE (FILM) When did you realize it wasn't? Leonard thinks back, trying to recall the exact moment he realized he was "alive.n Finally -- 
 LEONARD (FILM) When I spoke and you understood me. One tear snakes down Saver's cheek. The film cuts to silent footage of Leonard, soon after his awakening, combing his hair and delighting in the fact that he cjan comb it. Quietly, without looking at Miss Costello -- 
 You told him I was a kind man ... (long pause) It's kind to give life only to take it away? There is self-loathing in his voice. On the screen, Leonard's trying to operate an electric shaver that seems alive. 
 It's given and taken away from all of us. On screen, Leonard buttons buttons on his shirt and glances up smiling, proud. Tight on sayer in the dark room, the projector light flickering behind him. More to himself -- 
 Why doesn't that comfort me? 
 (quietly) Because you are kind. (pause) And because he's your friend. On screen, Leonard is beckoning to someone unseen. No one appears but he keeps beckoning. Finally Sayer, embarrassed and camera shy, appears. Though there is no sound, it is clear he asks, "What?" Leonard turns the doctor so that he is facing the camera, and points. Sayer again asks, "What?" "There," Leonard says. "Where?" Sayer demands. Finally, Sayer looks directly, curiously, into the camera. Rolando's music CONTINUES OVER:                                           ) 
 O.S. * /T\                It's winter. His voice is flat, inflectionless. His eyes, with little life behind them, staring at the falling snow. He's in a wheelchair. 
 O.S. Yes. 
 Am I speaking? 
 O.S. Yes. Leonard's eyes drift to a chair, his mother's chair, the one she has used for thirty years. It's empty. 
 O.S. Your mother is well. She's home. She visits you on Sundays. Leonard slowly nods.    Somehow he knows that. 
                : f ~^               She's living her own life. 
 O.S.                     , She's trying to. Leonard's eyes drift again, across to silent ghost-like figures in wheelchairs, the post-encephalitics, all of them, "asleep" again. 
 O.S. They fought, as you did, with great courage. They were strong. Leonard looks down at his hands and feels one with the other. He looks back at the "sleeping" patients, not comprehending why they cannot do the same. 
 I'm stronger? Sayer is finally revealed seated beside him. He doesn't answer. Leonard's hands slowly reach to his face and feel its features. 
 ,x             I'm here, aren't I? 
 Do you think you can walk? i 
 O.S. Dr. Tyler? The doctor turns.    Fernando is walking toward him. 
 You got a minute? 
 DR. TYLER (not really) What is it? Fernando arrives, leans against the corridor wall, and sort of mumbles --· 
 You know that woman in Ward 7 . . . Grace, uh ... what's her last name ... Grace ... 
 DR. TYLER (annoyed) Does it matter, Fernando? Sayer and Leonard walk slowly past, behind Tyler.          Fernando's eyes briefly meet Sayer's. 
 . . . no . . . I guess not . . . 
 O.S. Dr. Sullivan? 
 DR. SULLIVAN (turning) Yeah? 
 O.S. Dr. Kaufman? 
 O.S. Dr. Sayer? Sayer and Leonard stop just short of the doors. They glance back and see- Kaufman -and,v-several* steps .behind..him, looking distraught, Miss Costello. She has failed. 
 Yes? The two doctors stare at one another for several moments. Clearly Kaufman knows what is happening. Clearly Sayer knows he knows. Eventually -- 
               , Put a coat on him for Christ's sake.                          · He turns around, walks past Miss Costello and down the corridor- from which he came. Miss Costello relaxes, turns around and walks away down the corridor. Sayer and Leonard turn and walk outside. 
 . (a whisper back)           . Me, too.                                        ' 
 O.S. Good night. Sayer glances up, sees Miss Costello in the doorway to the corridor. 
 Good night. i She leaves. He-stays. iPuts.a -folder in.a.drawer* Straightens things on the desk. Looks for something more to do. Clearly there's nothing more to do. He gets up. Wanders slowly around the room. Past the medical instruments in the glass cases, the tripod and projector, along tne waii covered with taped and tacked data, notes, Polaroids. Buried in it he sees Leonard's original perception test, and alongside it, the first Polaroid of him . . . Sayer abruptly moves to the window, yanks at it, but it's jammed shut again. Below he can see Miss Costello crossing toward her car. He fights with the window, finally frees it, slides it open and yells out loudly - 
 Eleanor. She turns to the voice. He turns from the window. Tight on the glasses left on his desk. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing ... (he casts around) No , I was wo nde rin g . .. W hat ar e y o u d o i n g ? Y o u pr o b a b l y h a v e plans . . . or . . . 
 Because I was wondering . . . m aybe ... you h ave n o pla ns .. .? MIS S COS TELL O I ha ve no - 
 S Because -I -was -wondering, ..maybe . . .           . you'd . . . we . . . could . . . (grasping for an idea) I do n' t kn ow , go g et a c up    . o f cof fee somew here ... t ogeth er · · · or ··· 
 ... Maybe we could just . . . go for a walk ... ? He shrugs. That's the best he can do. A slow, slow smile crosses her face. 
 I 'd be delighted. 
 ,                    They're so life-like. ( 
 How 'bout those Jets? Leonard glances at the rear view mirror and finds in it the driver's eyes. 
 I like them. Leonard glances out the window, a little puzzled, to the sky, to see if there's one flying overhead. 
 Broadway Joe. The driver glances back to see what Leonard thinks of that.              * Leonard nods uncertainly. 
 Yeah. As they rattle along, Leonard peers back but the window at things going by, and absently pets the mechanical dog in his lap. Eventually - 
 You·re not from here. 
 I am. I was born here.     But.I've been away a long time. 
 Where? 
 The Bronx. Hector has to laugh, but it's cut short by the blare of his * horn as he slams it in response to another cab sliding into his * lane. 214-217.    OMITTED                                            214-217. 
 I don't mind sitting here if you don't, but to what end are we sitting here? Leonard watches a waitress in the diner, Paula, chatting with some young customers. His hand moves to and onto the car door handle, but then hesitates opening it. Paula is getting her coat and leaving with her friends. They have ice skates. 
                 : I ' m sorry to bother you, Len, I just thought you should know this is adding up, you know? Without taking his eyes from the skaters below, Leonard digs into his coat pocket and hands Hector a clump of money, hundreds of dollars. Embarrassed - 
 I didn't mean that, just - 
 I don't need it, you keep it. Hector puts the money back in Leonard's coat. Leonard finds Paula among the skaters, isolates her from them, and watches her glide around the rink. A fine mist of snow is falling, veiling her. 
 Beautiful, isn't it. 
 Unforgettable. 
 You have children, Hector? Hector takes a photograph from his chauffeur's permit plate and hands it back. A boy, five, healthy and happy. 
 He's lovely. 
 I thank God for him every day. Every single day. Leonard begins to weep softly. Once Hector notices, he slows the car, pulls to the curb, and studies Leonard in the rear view mirror. Has this man lost a child? The taxi engine idles.                                     : r-- '    , \% 221.   EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT                                 221. The cab, empty, parked in front of an apartment building in a working class neighborhood. 
 I have to be leaving. (having trouble with the words) I want to th-ank you. You've been very kind to me. 
 Leave? You're our guest, we got dinner coming. We're having something to eat. His wife agrees with a couple of words in Spanish as she gets              * up and crosses toward the kitchen.    . 
 Stay with us. 
 I can't. And he can't explain why. He takes the crumpled wad of money               * (and paper) from his coat pocket and tries to give it to Hector again. 
 Hey - 
 It has no value to me, believe    ; me. 
 I don't want it. 
 It's for your son. It's for him. Hector doesn't take it but doesn't say anything more about it when Leonard sets it down on the coffee table. 
 At least let me give you a lift wherever you're going. 
 No, I think I ' d like to walk.       . (to Hector's wife) Thank you. She nods, Your welcome, from the doorway of the kitchen. Leonard offers his hand to Hector to shake. 
 What's wrong with you, Len? 
 I know that. Leonard smiles; the man does know it, and appreciates it. 
 Bye. 
 O.S. Leonard? Sayer's face appears against a pastel dawn sky. Leonard glances up at him. Behind them, in the distance, Hector stands outside his parked cab. Sayer sits. Long silence . . . 
 What for? He smiles crookedly, then looks out across the water again. 
 Isn't that something . . . Sayer looks out. The morning colors are mirroring off the water like paint on glass. They both watch. The colors are deepening right before their eyes. Long, long silence before . . . 
 Can you take me home? Sayer helps him up. And as they move slowly toward the waiting taxi. Hector opens the rear door. The only sound is the hiss of tires, the -rhythm of wheels, .until - 
 V.O. When I was a boy I felt myself being carried away by illness like a swimmer sucked out by the tide. Drifting slowly out across the water and the Brooklyn Bridge stretching out across it. 
 V.O. I feel it again, only this time I've been somewhere. I vent to a J place and felt things I never dreamed of. I went to a place and felt hope and fear and hatred and love, I glimpsed life . . . 
 V.O. It's good, life. Spines of books on shelves lining the walls. And Paula's face, considering the titles. 
 [--\                           O.S. ;( __ lJ                 I t doesn't matter wh ich one. '                 They'r e all his favorites . 
 O.S. Leonard? He's in a wheelchair, behind an oak desk on which rests, among other things, the Ouija board. His eyes open but do not appear to comprehend the doctor's presence or his surroundings. His expression is absolutely "expressionless." 
 I ' m sorry to wake you, but there's someone here to see you. Leonard remains still. "Asleep." And there's a long silence broken only by the sound of pages being turned. And then, from Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop" -- 
 (reading) "Night is generally my time for walking. In the summer, I often leave home early in the morning and roam about fields and lanes.: ' "^             all day. Or even escape for days or weeks together . . . Leonard is unable to acknowledge in any way that he recognizes the words or her voice . . . but he does. And as she reads, the words become alive and the walls recede ...

 Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger! He    moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward the    door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door. It    is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As he    is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan. 
 Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce Lee... 
 
 KWAN (CONT'D) 
 KWAN (CONT'D) Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez. I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de! This last he says looking at the empty door. 
 
 Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors depend on heart and soul ­ that's how they saved the T'ang emporer. He looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering his students around him. 
 KWAN (CONT'D) Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez. (to class) During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er... fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But, there was also time for individual training ­ where skills were honed like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.

 Is taking the glued-on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling the already hard wax off his chest. 
 Practicing. I saw it in this movie... Kwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of him. 
 
 I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had tapes to study... they did it this way... right? 
 Not quite ­ our drills at the temple had meaning. If we had tapes, we would have watched them. Drew starts to protest, but Kwan doesn't even let him start. 
 KWAN (CONT'D) "The    warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win 100    times in 100 battles." Study the tapes I gave you. All    these years of one on one training ­ you're the best I've    ever taught. 
 
 
 
 Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I? 
 
 I'm not your son, Bob. Lay off. It is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension in the room, and starts to say something. 
 
 BOB (CONT'D) You're here because I told your Mom I'd see you were taken care of... after. At least respect my wishes, and make something of yourself... Stop wasting your time! 
 (sarcastic) When I'm the best fighter in the country, I'm not going to let you be part of my entourage... 
 
 
 
 
 I wish I had the chance... 
 
 TREVOR (CONT'D) 
 
 PFEELGUT (CONT'D) Exactly! Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it      to this guy, alternately playing with him and hurting him. As      the guy tries to hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose      and they start to fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and      Trevor starts to back up, laughing with the rest of the group. 
 PFEELGUT (CONT'D)

 TREVOR (CONT'D) Learn English, will ya? And, tell me something I don't know...

 Very good, sir. 
 Don't come here any more, you hear? Over a little more to the left, Sam. The masseur nods and adjusts his technique accordingly. 
 TREVOR (CONT'D) It's hard being me, you know. So much pressure... EXT. COLISEUM ­ DAY People are streaming into the large building. The marquee out front reads "Diamond Nationals". 
 
 The finals.

 Winning. The stage is set for the finals. ANGLE ON THE RING Drew and Trevor are already inside, waiting. Drew fights in a mish mosh of gear (different colors, different makes), while Trevor is decked out in designer, personalized gear. 
 
 
 You only lose if you give up. 
 
 DREW'S FOREARM. 
 
 (shaking his head) No next time, Master. Maybe... (big sigh) ... you should find a new student. I just can't do it ­ I'm not getting any better! 
 KWAN (CONT'D) Don't talk like that. At Shaolin... He pauses, and decides not to tell another Shaolin Temple story. Drew looks at him funny ­ this is very against his character. 
 KWAN (CONT'D) 
 KWAN (CONT'D) 
 KWAN (CONT'D) The crowd whispered "Shaolin", and he bowed to us, touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed then and there to become like him, fight for right like the Shaolin. He pauses again, looking at Drew. Drew meets his gaze, wondering why he is telling him this story. 
 KWAN (CONT'D) I never did, though. My family left China and ended up here in New York, a young boy's dream left behind in 
 You mean... all the stories...? 
 (nodding) Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other people. 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 
 KWAN (CONT'D) 
 
 
 Never were? 
 No. Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this. 
 KWAN (CONT'D) What? 
 
 
 I'm going to the Shaolin Temple ­ they can train me so I will never lose like that again. Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's eyes. 
 He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold cloth. He starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down.

 Where is the Shaolin Temple? Shaolin? 
 
 DREW (CONT'D) The Shaolin Temple? How hard can that be? Geez, doesn't anyone speak English here? ANGLE ON ASHEMA As she pushes her way to the front of the group. She is a strikingly beautiful young woman. 
 I do. But wouldn't it make more sense for you to speak Chinese than to expect us to speak English? 
 (flustered) 
 Why do you want to find the temple? 
 (not without pride) I am going to join the temple as a monk. Ashema translates this for her friends, and they titter anew. They gesture to Drew's longish hair and laugh, and then make some attempts at martial arts movements. 
 ASHEMA (CONT'D) I'm going that way ­ I can take you. 
 
 
 ASHEMA (CONT'D) 
 We are here. DREW STOPS THE BIKE AND LOOKS BACK AT HER. GESTURES TO THE TEMPLE FRONT, AND DREW TURNS IN AWE. EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE TEMPLE. This is it ­ the temple he came halfway around the world to see. The Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts.

 DREW (CONT'D) What's the deal here? Is everybody deaf in this temple? Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you? Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter? He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed. He walks back into the chanting chamber. INT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY The monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more, moving with the beat, until they stop chanting. Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands.

 DREW (CONT'D) 
 That's not possible. 
 What do you mean, sir? 
 The training is too difficult. Besides, Shaolin policy is no foreigners. 
 I didn't come all this way, from America, to get turned away. I want in. I want to become a Shaolin monk. 
 What people want and what they can have are often not the same. 
 Not in this case. 
 Oh, yes, especially in this case. 
 
 
 
 WITH A THUMP! 
 Hey! What about my... 
 
 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 
 
 You've had enough. 
 ASHEMA (CONT'D) Maybe it's for the best, Drew. You belong in America. New 
 I have to do this. I can't go home, not until I'm a monk. I'd be even more of a disgrace... The old man talks to Ashema for the first time. He chatters in Chinese, motioning towards Drew. 
 Not now, Bau Bau. 
 Bau Bau? 
 
 ASHEMA (CONT'D) 
 
 
 How long? 
 A long time ­ through the worst weather. He just sat there, unmoving, through rain, sleet, snow. 
 Did they let him in? 
 No. (beat) Of course they did ­ what kind of story do you think my 
 Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he is a wise man. And that he tells a good story. The grandfather smiles at him, nodding his head. 
 What are you going to do? Are you going home? Drew shakes his head. 
 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 
 
 Give this up, Drew! Please? 
 ASHEMA (CONT'D) 
 My head is shiny enough already, don't you think? Drew, in shock at his ability to speak English, sputters 
 You... You speak English? I'm sorry, I was just goofing... I apologize, master. I didn't mean to make fun of you... San De shrugs it off. Apology accepted. 
 
 
 
 
 
 It was at first. I was uncomfortable, in pain, actually, but as time went on, I got... into it, I guess. The sacrifice made me feel... in control, you know what I mean? 
 (nodding) 
 At first I was really bored, and very lonely. But then, 
 DREW (CONT'D) It was an incredible experience ­ I said I'd do it, and I did it. San De, watching Drew intently, smiles at this last. He stands up and bows to Drew. Drew bows back, from his seated position. 
 I wish you all the best. 
 
 They are disciples. This is the last class for fighting monks at Shaolin. Drew, very concerned, watches as the monks-to-be file through the temple doors. The mothers and fathers of the boys watch proudly as the last ones go through. The temple doors close. 
 ASHEMA (CONT'D) 
 Do you accept the authority of the Shaolin patriarchs?

 Do you renounce the earthly world? 
 
 Will you abide by the rules of the temple, even if it means death? 
 I do. The Drill Sergeant comes up behind Drew and WHACKS him in the side with his elbow. 
 (whispering)

 Yes, without pause. The Drill Sergeant nods his head. 
 
 Yes, without pause. 
 DREW (CONT'D) I mean, no, of course not. Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded. A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards the raised platform in the center. Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure. It is San De! San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then clears his throat. Everyone stands up again. 
 
 
 
 Shut up! 
 (holding his side) Oh, unbelievable, in the same place... 
 Are they ready to begin their training? 
 They are. 
 
 You got a problem, man? 
 You, American... ANGLE ON SAN DE

 No way, man! Get your own...

 Mr. James designs my hair, master. I don't think... D.S.

 Wonder what they'll start us with first?

 Back up and let me pass. 
 No chance, Gao. You back up. Gao smiles and shakes   his head. Gao starts forward, and WHACKS Drew in the leg with a leg   sweep. Drew tries to keep his balance, and fights a valient, but   losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt in his buckets flying   everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and continues walking. CLOSEUP ON'S BLOODY HAND A huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S. walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out. 
 
 LI (CONT'D) The "Wooden Man Chamber"! The ultimate test of a Shaolin monk... 
 
 Poor guy. 
 He just wasn't good enough. I wouldn't be surprised if half of us go out the same way. The D.S. appears and motions for them to work. INT.

 So what is this 'night soil' stuff anyway? 
 
 Oh, man! You guys actually use this as fertilizer? That's disgusting! 
 DREW (CONT'D) Hi, Gao. How you doing? 
 (a little worried) Let me pass. He reaches down and plucks a stick out of the earth at his feet, and then closes on Gao a little bit. 
 DREW (CONT'D) There's something on the bottom of your basket. 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 This is ridiculous. 
 DREW (CONT'D) I've got an idea on how to get even with our beloved Drill Sergeant... They all huddle a little closer. EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF D.S. AS HE WALKS ALONG THE PATH. In the b.g. can be seen Drew, Li, Wu and a couple other of the disciples. They are waiting for something. 
 Bodhidharma meditated for 9 years without sleeping. Think you can manage 9 minutes? EXT. WORK AREA ­ DAY 
 
 But we swore to obey them... 
 
 Huh? 
 We have to stand up for our rights! If they don't even know we're dissatisfied, things will never change. 
 
 Are we men or mice? Sheep or the shepherd? 
 I'm with you! The others are with him too, except for Gao. They are ready to explode, and Drew has the match. 
 I'm for going to the Headmaster right now! They are all ready. They head for the door, but Gao doesn't move. Drew stops at the door and turns to Gao. 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 D.S. 
 Master San De! 
 
 We have something to say... 
 This is an interesting coincidence, as I was just on my way to your sleeping quarters to talk with you all. 
 
 I think I'd better... 
 No, really, I want to... San De holds up his hand. He is the final authority. 
 Here at the temple,    we use a period of intense physical labor to test your    patience, and to teach you humility and self-reliance.    As you continue training, you will be given chores every    day ­ remember the first time you saw me I was sweeping?    Physical labor keeps us humble. 
 
 Gentlemen, this calls for a party! He runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers, and puts on some good old American Rock 'N' Roll. Everyone, but Gao, is moving in time with the music. Drew is the most accomplished dancer, but the others are pretty bad. The entire effect of the bald-headed monks rocking out is very comic. Drew starts showing Li and Wu a couple of dance routines (old stuff ­ the swim, the twist, etc.). Everyone is having a great time. 
 
 
 It's not over, American. INT. MAIN CHAMBER ­ MORNING ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CHAMBER FULL OF FIGHTING MONKS, ALL GOING THROUGH THE SAME SET OF MOVEMENTS. Kick. Punch. Kick. Punch. 
 In order to keep our bodies strong, Bodhidharma gave us a series of exercises and breathing techniques. Because the times demanded action, we developed Shaolin style wu shu from these exercises. He goes through a couple of martial movements.

They are moving through a series of techniques, ending with a flashy kicking technique which is to blocked by a special Shaolin technique. 
 
 
 MONK (CONT'D) 
 (menacingly) My turn. He attacks, and Drew gets to the final technique. He blocks the way he did before, and he gets slammed brutally by Gao. Gao stands over him, smiling. 
 Emotions cloud the spirit ­ eliminate them. 
 This isn't martial arts ­ it's gymnastics! 
 This is Shaolin Wu Shu. Continue. 
 (looking at ground) Excuse me, Master, but there aren't any mats here. D.S. Do they always use mats in America? 
 D.S. (CONT'D) If you are scared, I'll get someone else. Perhaps Gao would assist me... ANGLE ON GAO 
 Let's do it. D.S. Attack me straight on... Drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard concrete floor. No attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow. Drew gets up right away, and attacks again. Again he is driven to the ground. This continues from all angles and all methods of attack. 
 DREW (CONT'D) I'm not sure I got that last throw clear in my mind. 
 DREW (CONT'D) If you're getting too old for this kind of training, I understand. D.S. Attack! 
 DREW (CONT'D) I think I've got it now. Xie Xie! The group disburses, shaking their heads in wonder. Li comes up to Drew, who is still lying on the ground. 
 Are you trying to kill yourself? 
 He hurts more than me, he's just not bleeding, that's all.

 This sure beats sweeping... 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 
 The crowd is going wild. Just then, out of the shadows comes an attacking staff, SLAMMING into Drew's unprotected stomach! Drew, ready to double over in pain, hears the staff hit the frisbee, and stands up straight, adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach. Before he can react, the staff SMACKS him in the back of the head and sends him pitching to the floor. 
. 
 
 
 Come with me... 
 Legend states that Bodhidharma gave us tea. Once, while meditating, Bodhidharma fell asleep, a natural reaction we all have to fight against. San De looks pointedly at Drew, who doesn't meet his eyes. (CONT'D) When he awoke, he was so enraged at his eyelids for betraying him, he tore them off and threw them to the ground. (beat) From those eyelids grew the first tea bush. You see, even the leaves look like eyelids. San De shows Drew a tea leaf. 
 
 
 
 DREW (CONT'D) Master! Stop! No more will go in! 
 Exactly! You are like this cup, full of what you have learned. How can we show you Shaolin unless you first empty your cup? He picks up the cup and tosses the tea through an open window. He now pours into the empty cup. (CONT'D) The rules and disciplines of the temple exist to free you, not restrict you. They keep your mind from harmful

 You can get kicked out of the temple for this... 
 Who's going to tell, Li? You? 
 
 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 
 
 We really shouldn't be doing this... 
 
 My school is having a party this Tuesday night. Can you and your friends come? Li and the guys immediately hem and haw their negative replies, but Drew smiles and takes Ashema's hand. The girls start to giggle again. He brings her hand up to his lips, and kisses it gently.

 DREW (CONT'D) I lost my temper. He was only defending himself. 
 
 Yes. But, I am not completely blameless... 
 I didn't think you were... (beat) The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other. Never do we fight to see who is best ­ we train to be able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch or kick in anger.

 DREW (CONT'D) Ladies, allow me to introduce my best friends in all of China... He drags Gao over to one of the prettier girls. 
 DREW (CONT'D) This is Gao. And this wild man is Li... Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing them to stand with the girls for a moment. When everyone is paired off, he motions to Ashema. 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 (eyes still closed) Not now, Li... The hand comes in again, punching Drew in the shoulder hard. 
 DREW (CONT'D) What can I do for you? TOUGH 
 No, thanks. He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls, away from danger. The tough spins Drew around and pushes him HARD. One of the toughs has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and Drew goes flipping over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of him.

 We demand that he leaves the temple, and China! 
 He's a disgrace, to the temple and to this country. He must leave. They all agree that Drew should leave, and for a moment the sound of the three of them agreeing fills the room (ad libs). ANGLE ON DREW Who is staring down into the abyss. 
 
 This involves more than just the temple. I am authorized to escort him from your temple to the jail now, tonight, where he will be held until he leaves the country. San De pauses, letting this sink in. The D.S. steps forward. D.S. Master, may I? (San De nods) We accepted a challenge when this disciple came into our ranks. If we force him to leave China, we admit failure. Can we do that? 
 
 
 Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that you brought this problem to our attention. May you sleep well tonight 
 I do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news. 
 You will not have to. The Headmistress starts to say something, but San De holds up his hand, stopping her. He leads them out, then closes the door and comes back to face Drew. 
 Master, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I appreciate you both going to bat like that for me. I won't let it happen again.

 Are you staying? 
 Yeah, I'm staying. If only to keep you guys out of trouble! They walk off, and just as they round a corner, a BANG is heard as one of the monks drops the heavy wooden lid of a storage barrell. Drew jumps, spinning around in the direction of the sound.

MEDITATION HALL ­ NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF BARE CHESTED DREW, SOAKED IN SWEAT. 
. 
 
 D.S. (CONT'D) 
 With pleasure. Drew tries another kip, pushing his feet towards the D.S.' chest. He lands on his feet easily, surprised. EXT. WATERFALL ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF AND GAO UNDER THE WATERFALL. THEY ARE BOTH IN HORSE STANCES. THEY NOD AT EACH OTHER, AND THEY BEGIN GOING THROUGH A SLOW FORM, MOVING THEIR ARMS AND LEGS CAUTIOUSLY, BUT WITH 
. 
 
 (bowing) Boy, his spirit is strong... 
 
. They come to a stream, and there by a stream is a beautiful young woman who can't get across the stream without getting her clothes soaked. 
 
 
 
 Lucky shot, slant eye! ANGLE ON GAO Who gives him a mean look. 
 You stink, American! ANGLE ON DREW 
 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 
 I wonder what you did now... INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF AND SAN DE SITTING ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER. San De has an ornately embroidered golden box in his hand, and he is showing it to Drew. 
 
 I will, Master. 
 If you deliver this, you may ask this master, the most advanced monk of the Shaolin tradition, any question you wish, and he must answer it. San De takes out a map of the area. (CONT'D) This map will lead you to the Jade Mountain. Let nothing deter from safeguarding the sacred scroll. You leave first thing tomorrow morning. 
. 
 
 DREW (CONT'D) (to himself) This humble, not fighting stuff is harder, and more painful, than it looks! 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 
 Why not? 
 I'm a monk. I've taken a vow to abstain... 
 
 I'll know! Throw me my clothes, please. Pouting, the woman takes Drew's pants and tosses them to him, but they land (purposely) about 5 feet away from the lake edge. 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 DREW (CONT'D) Despite the fact that this is every teenage boy's dream come true, I can't! He lowers her hands, and her head drops, pouting. 
 DREW (CONT'D) Besides, if I were to break my vows, it would not be with you.

 2 Do they have a gift shop? 
 3 Guide! How do you say 'gift shop'? 
 
 1 A real live monk! Somebody, take my picture! 
 Oh Mi Two Fwo He then turns and walks away. 
 (O.S.) Monks don't like to be bothered, they are from a different world. 
 I'll say... EXT. WATERFALL ­ EARLY MORNING 
 
 Is this rope strong enough for both of us? No answer from the man, who is now pushing Drew to go faster. He is inching up closer to him, and occassionally kicking him to go quicker. 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 DREW (CONT'D) Hold on... Drew hears the headmaster's voice. 
 (O.S.) The scroll that is in this box is more precious than life. Guard it well. He looks down at the man, who is about to lose it. 
 What the heck... Drew reaches down for the man's hand, letting the box fall. Their hands meet, and Drew pulls him up. ANGLE ON BOX As it spins down into the abyss. ANGLE ON AND MAN 
 
 Maybe he won't miss one little scroll... He shakes his head and starts for the front door. 
 Master! I apologize, I did not see you. The Arhat says nothing, but just puts out his hand for the scroll. Drew bows again, and gets down on his knees. 
 DREW (CONT'D) I failed, Master. A person was in danger... The Arhat holds up his hand, and Drew stops talking. 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 DREW (CONT'D) What is the meaning of life? 
 (smiling ruefully) 
 No. American. ARHAT I notice the littlest details. 
 
 
 
 ARHAT (CONT'D) Bus stops every 20 min., will take you straight to the temple. Drew smiles and shakes his head, then bows to the Arhat. The Arhat returns the bow. 
 Thank you, Master. ARHAT 
 We've got to rebuild this? D.S. No. (beat) 
. He is going nowhere in particular, just walking and thinking. 
 D.S. 
. The CAMERA follows the sweeping brush, as it ends with a FLOURISH. The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the temple courtyard, where San De and the D.S. are standing in front of the group of disciples. 
 Only one trial remains before you become full fledged fighting monks. The Wooden Man Chamber. ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES They are remembering the stories they have heard about the chamber. 
 
 DREW (CONT'D) Then I must pass this final test. Furthermore, I request that I be the first one through. 
 (very proud) Your request is granted. 
 DREW (CONT'D) 
 (whispering) I can't do it. 
 D.S. 
 DREW (CONT'D) I am a Shaolin monk. He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again. Drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically). He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him, making his way across. He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way. 
 DREW (CONT'D) Not this time. Drew quickly walks through the door. EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CHEERING ASSEMBLAGE, SAN DE AND D.S. AT THE FRONT. HE HAS MADE IT! 
. 
 You are now Shaolin. We welcome you into our ranks as fighting monks... A roar rises from the assembled monks, and fireworks go off all around. ANGLE ON REAR OF COURTYARD 
 
 
 
 
 That monk was me. 
 Anything. 
 Before you leave for American, can you help at an international tournament in Beijing? The Shaolin temple has an entry, and he will be fighting men from all over the world ­ I'd like you to be there. 
 No problem. (he smiles) Without pause. 
 Now, a friend would like to see you. (beat) 
. 
 
 
 Did you think he would get into the finals? 
 Who could know? He fights the winner of the Western countries, which is why I wanted you here. 
 I'll help any way I can. ANGLE ON THE CROWD As it parts to let someone through. Drew turns casually to look at the competitor. Slowly, a figure, followed by a large group of people, comes clear... it is Trevor! 
 
 TREVOR (CONT'D) (to San De) He take a vow of silence too? Nice hair, Drew. (he looks at Ashema) If he took a vow of chastity too, honey, you see me after this fight, 'Kay? He puts his arm around Ashema and lets his hand slide down onto her rear end. 
 TREVOR (CONT'D) Wish me luck, huh? He walks off, and Drew, who still hasn't said a word, stares after 
 TREVOR (CONT'D) 
 TREVOR (CONT'D) 
 TREVOR (CONT'D) 
 TREVOR (CONT'D) I want the American Shaolin! ANGLE ON DREW 
 I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never happen again. 
 So, let's see what you've learned. 
 (shaking his head) I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be defeated, not you. 
 TREVOR (CONT'D) 
 
 
 
 
 No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for my ego. 
 You have learned much. ANGLE ON TREVOR 
 
 
 
 
 (looking at drew) 
 GAO (CONT'D) Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of the temple. San De looks at Drew long and hard. 
 There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson. 
 For the temple... Drew climbs into the ring. 
 Remember last time, punk? 
 Nothing exists but the moment, and... (beat) 
 Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight! And he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry. Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this    quickly. He goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that    Trevor is completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will,    and soon has Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of    high kicks, takedowns, flips and punches. Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even bothering to defend himself. Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old- fashioned roundhouse punch.

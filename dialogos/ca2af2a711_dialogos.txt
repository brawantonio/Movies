 
 Dick Laurent is dead. 
 You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight? 
 I thought I'd stay home and read. 
 I like to laugh, Fred. 
 Wake me up when you get home. 
 A videotape. 
 I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it. 
 (looking it over) No, nothing. 
 FRED (CON'T) (to Renee) Come on. 
 It must be from a real estate agent. 
 (she looks up) Huh?... oh, yeah, it is. 
 What night? 
 Oh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different one. 
 Called?  When? 
 I must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I? 
 (without looking up) I told you you could wake me up if you wanted to. 
 Yeah? 
 FRED'S DREAM 
 (tentatively - distant and off screen) Fred?  Fred, where are you? 
 Fred, are you all right? 
 That dog woke me.  I lay there for a while, then decided to get up. 
 Yes, I just found it on the step. 
 I guess so. 
 Yeah. 
. 
 We've got to call the police. 
 ...yes, I've been on hold for ten minutes... I can't... All right, thanks. 
 Hello, yes... Good... My name is Renee Madison... My husband is Fred Madison, the jazz musician... we	live at 442 Hollis Street... Right... 442 Hollis... near the observatory... Someone's been in the house... at night... while we were sleeping... I know because they sent, dropped off a videotape... two videotapes... to show us... That's right... Yes... it... the second one... shows us asleep... Someone broke in and taped us while we slept!... Isn't that enough?... Okay, sure... We will... 442 Hollis... Yes, we'll be here. 
 Two detectives are coming out. 
 Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom. 
 Very strange. 
 What is? 
 The angle.  The high angle shot on the tape. 
 How'd the camera get so high like that? 
 And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean. 
 Like you'd get if it was hand held. 
 Right ... This just glided along. 
 This is the bedroom. 
 Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you? 
 There's no other bedroom? 
 You're a musician? 
 What's your axe? 
 (shakes his head) Tone deaf. 
 (to Renee) Do you own a video camera? 
 No. Fred hates them. 
 What do you mean by that? 
 Do you have an alarm system? 
 Yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it. 
 Why not? 
 Might be a good time to try using it again. 
 Anybody else have a key to the house. 
 No. 
 Maid?  Relative? 
 No, one of us is always here to let the maid in.  Nobody else has a key. 
 (to Al) Let's check the doors and windows... See if there's been a break-in. 
 
 As best we can. 
 If anything else happens, you'll call us. Al hands Fred a card.  Ed hands Renee a card. 
 We will. 
 It's what we do. 
. 
 What the hell is going on?! 
 What was that?!!! 
 On the tape!  There was something else on the tape. 
 RENEE (CON'T) There!  Play it! 
 You don't remember being awakened?  It looks like you were aware of someone. 
 Or something. 
 Why would anyone do something like this? 
 Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently? 
 Or not so recently? 
 I...	no. No. No threats. 
 We'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you? 
 We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled. 
 I don't know if I want to stay here.  I don't feel safe. 
 I don't know. maybe a hotel. 
 Did you use the alarm system since we were here last? 
 Why not? 
 Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our house while we're sleeping, filming us, and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I thought you set the alarm! 
 But that doesn't solve the problem.  Who is doing this?  And why? 
 We'll find out, Mrs. Madison. 
 We've met before, haven't we? 
 At your house.  Don't you remember? 
 Of course.  In fact, I'm there right now. 
 At your house. 
 Call me. 
 
 (CON-T) Dial your number. 
 
 (CON-T) Go ahead. 
 I told you I was here. 
 Ask me. 
 You invited me.  It's not my habit to go where I'm not wanted. 
 Give me my phone back. 
 It's been a pleasure talking to you. 
 I thought you were getting me a drink? 
. 
 (looking at the Mystery Man) I don't know his name.  He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think. 
 Yes, I believe so. 
 He is?  I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead? 
 (angrily) Dick can't be dead.  Who told you he was dead? 
 Honey, who?... Who's dead? 
 But... 
 It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job... 
 I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay... 
 Why? what is it?  Why did you make me wait out here? 
 Was there? 
 It's so odd... Waiting out there, I had the strangest feeling... Like this had happened before.  I mean, your telling me to stay outside while you went in like that. 
 (tentatively) Fred?  Fred, where are you? 
 FRED (CON'T) (Shouting) 
! 
 Stay put, killer! 
 Hi, doc. Workin' late tonight, huh? 
 Howdy, Joyce. 
 Howdy, George. 
 I don't know if I can watch this. 
 You talking to me or... her? 
 Have you reached a verdict? 
 Yes, we have, your honor. 
 Please hand it to the bailiff. 
 And what is your verdict? 
 We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. 
 Fred Madison, the jury having found you guilty of murder in the first degree, it is my order that on a date to be determined, you be put to death in the electric chair. 
 Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces? 
 How could I miss it?  The TV won't quit with that stuff. 
 They're gonna cook him. 
 Andy's from Utah.  He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad. 
 Which would you choose? 
 Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely. 
 Do they aim for the head or for the heart? 
 The heart, I guess. 
 I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on.  Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity.  Savage pain, Marian. 
 Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be hung, huh? 
 Absolutely... Soon as your neck snaps, you black out.  It might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it. 
 You might be right, Raquel. 
 Guess who? 
 Make yourself to home, fella. 
 #1 (very quietly - solemnly) Here he comes. 
 #1 See you soon, Sammy.  Don't think takin' a jolt is gonna get you outta payin' me back the twenty you owe me. 
 #2 Don't take it personal, pal. 
 #3 Un fuerte abrazo, amigo! 
 #4 Hang in there, honey. 
 #5 Keep an eye out for me, Sammy G. 
 #6 Show 'em you got big stones, bro. 
 (into phone) Line check. (pause) Okay. 
 Any final words, Sam? 
 Something wrong? 
 Headache, huh?  Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it. 
 What's botbering you, Madison? 
 I can't give you anymore.  I'll talk to the doctor. 
 You sleeping okay? 
 You'll sleep now. (to Guards) Take him back to his cell. 
 What is it? 
 The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning. 
 #1 Shit, that wife killer's lookin' pretty fucked up. 
 #2 (not looking up from his magazine) Which one? 
 Who are you?  What are you doing in this cell? 
 This is Johnny Mack at station 8. Yeah, look, somethin' crazy's happened.  No, I mean, Madison ain't in his cell.  No, there's somebody in there, but it ain't Madison! Right, right.  Okay... Captain Henderson's comin''?... Right. 
 F-u-u-u-ck me! 
. 
 Now, Mack, what's the situation? 
 I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself. 
 That's not Fred Madison? 
 No, sir, it's not. 
 Who is it? 
 I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson? 
 Yeah, Mack? 
 J0HNNY MACK Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here. 
 Repeat that, Bill. 
 Warden, it's not him.  It .was not Fred Madison in that cell. 
 Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be? 
 I don't know.  The guards say they've never seen him before. 
 Where is he now? 
 He's in the infirmary, being examined. 
 Did you ask him who he is? 
 He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway. 
 If he's not Madison, then where's Madison? 
 I've got men searching the building and the grounds now. 
 I want to take a look at this man myself. 
 What is this, Rogoff? 
 DR. ROGOFF I don't know yet. 
 Who is this man? 
 DR. ROGOFF He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away.  We'll find out soon enough. 
 He's not Madison? 
 DR. ROGOFF (slowly, deliberately Not even close. 
 A headache? 
 DR. ROGOFF I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill.  I've never seen this man before.  Neither have the guards.  I don't think he's in the system. 
 Where the hell did you come from, mister? 
 Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton. He's twenty-four years old.  His birthday is April 21st.  He was born and raised right here.  He lives with his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue.  Pete Dayton was arrested five (MORE) 
 WARDEN (CON-T) How about Madison?  Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts? 
 Nothing, Marsh.  Vanished.  There's an APB out on him.  His photo's been faxed nationwide. 
 #1 I had a call from the governor's office about this. 
 How the hell does she know? 
 #1 There's press outside right now. 
 How the hell... 7 
 One of the guards must have leaked it. 
 What's the word on the street? 
 #2 Only that Madison has apparently escaped. Nothing about the other guy. 
 Good, let's keep it that way.  Keep a lid on Dayton.  Nothing gets out about him. 
 I have a statement to read... Fred Madison, an inmate being held on death row has, apparently... has escaped.  An all-points bulletin has been issued to authorities not only statewide, but nationwide.  We are confindent that he will be apprehended very soon.  No further details are available at this time.  Thank you very much. 
 Warden, nobody's ever escaped from death row before.  How did he get out? 
 I'm Warden Clements.  This is Captain Henderson and Dr. Rogoff.  Please, sit down. 
 WARDEN (CON'T) Mr. and Mrs. Dayton, as you were told over the phone, your son, Peter, is here. 
 WARDEN (CON'T) He... He was discovered this morning... in a cell on death row. 
 WARDEN (CON'T) A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison. 
 The wife killer? 
 Yes. 
 How is this possible, Warden? 
 ...Tell me, what was Peter's condition the last time you saw him? 
 His condition?  What do you mean? 
 His physical condition. 
 (hesitates) Same as always.  Pete takes care of himself. 
 I saw him before he went to the garage day before yesterday.  He's a mechanic. Look, is he okay?  Can we see him? 
 DR. ROGOFF He has a hematoma on his forehead and a condition called blepharitis... that's redness and swelling around the eyes. 
 Was he in a fight? 
 DR. ROGOFF These conditions don't indicate a fight. 
 But what is the cause then? ... And how did he get in that cell? 
 DR. ROGOFF He can't talk.  Or won't. 
 That doesn't sound like Pete. 
 DR. ROGOFF Your son has experienced some sort of trauma, I'm afraid.  We were hoping that the two of you could help explain the cause of the trauma and how he came to be here. 
 You don't know Fred Madison? 
 No... Only what was in the news. 
 Do you think Pete knows him? 
 I wouldn't know how. 
 (to Claire) You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday? 
 When he went to work, right. 
 What about yesterday? 
 He didn't come home. 
 Sometimes he stays at a friend's. 
 Any particular friends? 
 A girl's, a buddy's.  I don't know.  He's his own man; he comes and goes as he pleases. 
 I want to see him. 
 Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can. (to Dr. Rogoff) Mel, let's get Peter in here. 
 (tenderly) Pete... 
 WARDEN (CON'T) Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this? 
 Pete, what happened to you? 
 CLAIRE (CON'T) It's okay.  Take your time, honey. 
 (afraid - quiet) Where ... am I? 
 DR. ROGOFF You're in the state penitentiary.  You were found in a cell on death row. 
 My head hurts. 
 A man named Fred Madison was occupying that cell.  He's missing. we're trying to find out how it is you were in there and not him. 
 I... I don't know. 
 Do you know Fred Madison? 
 (straining) No. 
 (worried) Warden, can we take him home? 
 DR. ROGOFF (to Warden) From a medical standpoint, I don't see why not. 
 We need to find out what happened here. 
 (standing up) Have you made any charges against him? 
 No. 
 Then he's coming home with his mother and me. 
 All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave. 
 (to warden) You just gonna let him go? 
 We'll get a tail put on him. 
 Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay. 
 Are you hungry, honey?  I'll fix you something. 
 No... I don't feel so good.  I would like some aspirin. 
 Coming up. 
 Thanks, Al. 
 Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm in the kitchen. 
 Where's Pete? 
 Out in back. 
 You talk to him? 
 (urgent) No... Here he comes. 
 How're you feelin'? 
 (unsure - brow furrowed) Better. 
 Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'.  They miss you pretty bad down at the garage.  I told 'im you still had a "fever". 
 Okay.  Thanks. 
 Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya. 
 Yeah. 
 You really don't remember the other night, do you? 
 What night is that? 
 The night before you showed up in the slammer... 
 Do you remember? 
 No... I don't.  Why? 
 Hey. 
 You look like shit. 
 What happened? 
 Just haven't been feelin' well. 
 I don't think so. 
 Where to?  Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too. 
 They found a cyst on my god damn ovary. Had to cut it out.  You wanna see the scar? 
 (winking) Hadn't slowed her down none. 
 (smacking him) Shut up, bone-head. 
 Sheila'll be at "Tops". 
 Okay. 
 (to Bill and Claire) Goin' out with these clowns for a while. 
 Do ya good. 
 I hate ridin' in this fuckin' car. 
 Take it easy, Pete, "V" loves this rod. 
 "V" (CON'T) Oh my, oh my. 
 Keep it in your pants, "V". 
 This rod is a fuckin, embarrassment, Carl.  Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"? 
 Listen. 
 Hey.  Where have you been? 
 No, I'm okay. 
 I missed you. 
 Yeah?... 
 Yeah. 
 #1 What happened to your face? 
 Nothin'. 
 What are you guys doin'? 
 Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin". 
 You want some company? 
 Sure. 
 They're comin' with us. 
 Why haven't you called me? 
 Sorry... I... 
 (whispering) What's happening to you?  What happened to your face? 
 I don't know. 
 (whispering) What do you mean? ... You've been acting strange lately ... Like the other night. 
 What night? 
 Last time I saw you. 
 I don't remember... What happened that night? 
 You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known. 
 Whatiya mean? 
 You were acting like a different person. 
 Who else could I be7 
 I don't know. 
 SHEILA (CON'T) You still care about me? 
 Sure.  Sure I do. 
 PETE (CON'T) What else about that night?... Did anything happen? 
 You really don't remember? 
 No... I told you. 
 It was weird... 
 Whatiya mean, Sheila? 
 I don't want to talk about it... 
 Sheila?! 
 No... I really don't want to talk about it. 
 Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete.  How are you? 
 (climbing out of the Camaro) Feeling good, Arnie.  Ready to get to work. 
 Wonderful, Pete.  Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy. 
 Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy.  Can you take care of Mr. Smith now? 
 Sure. 
 Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in? 
 Sure, Arnie.  Bring 'em on, I'm ready. 
 MR. EDDY PETE!!! WHERE'S PETE?!! 
 No, it's nothin'... I'm all right. 
 MR. EDDY Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. (snaps his finger - loud)

 Okay... Lemme clear it with... 
 MR. EDDY It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go. 
 MR. EDDY Now listen... It only happens when I'm accelerating.  I think it's the carburetors. 
 No, it's not the carburetors.  Pull over, but keep it runnin'. 
 MR. EDDY Best god damn ears in town. (to the guys in back) You guys are lookin' at him.  The man with the best god damn ears in town. 
 Give that a try. 
 MR. EDDY All right! 
 Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy. 
 MR. EDDY Oh, shit... Is that what I think it is? 
 MR. EDDY (clenched teeth) This is where power and mechanical excellence pays off. 
 MR. EDDY DON'T YOU EVER FUCKIN' TAILGATE.

 #1 Tell him you won't tailgate. 
 MR. EDDY EVER!!!! 
 I won't ever tailgate. 
 MR. EDDY DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?

 I do like you, Sheila. 
 How much? 
 
 (ALICE) Hi. I'm Alice Wyatt. 
 Pete Dayton. 
 I was here yesterday. 
 Yeah, I remember. 
 How would you like to take me to dinner? 
 (laughs uncomfortably) I don't know. 
 Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner. 
 Look, I don't think it's a good idea. 
 Where's your phone?  I have to call another taxi. 
 (pointing) Over there. 
 (into phone) Can you give me the number for United Cab? 
 ALICE (CON'T) (into phone) Thanks. 
 ALICE (CON'T) (into phone) Yes, I need a taxi at Arnie's Auto Repair, the corner of Fifth and... 
 (into phone) We won't be needing a cab, thanks anyway. 
 Why don't we just skip dinner7 
 'Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat. 
 (whispers) Take off my clothes. 
 (whispers) I want more. 
 Me, too. 
 Can I call you? 
 Yeah... Call me at home.  I'll give you the number. 
 (kissing him) Okay, baby. 
 (fear) Is that car following us? 
 I'll lose 'em at the light. 
 I don't recognize the car... 
 (voiceover) I'll get it! 
 (into phone) Hello. 
 (phone voice) It's me... 
 Hi. 
 I can't see you tonight. 
 (disappointed) Okay ... 
 I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy. 
 Sure. 
 I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you. 
 ALICE (CON'T) Pete? 
 Me, too. 
 I'll call you again. 
 What's the matter? 
 Nothin'. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 PETE (CON'T) I'm, okay... You okay? 
 Where'd you come from? 
 I've been here.  You were lookin, right at me. 
 I was? 
 Yeah. 
 I didn't know you cared. 
 Come on. 
 (whispered pain) Pete... Pete... 
 What a fuckin' job. 
 His or ours? 
 Ours, Ed. 
 Hey. 
 Sit down a minute. 
 What's up? 
 Sit down. 
 BILL (CON'T) You don't look so good. 
 I gotta headache... What's goin' on? 
 The police called us. 
 Yeah? what did they want? 
 They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night.  They wanted to know if you remembered anything. 
 But I don't remember anything.  What did you tell 'em? 
 (whispers) We saw you that night, Pete. 
 You came home.  Your friend Sheila brought you here. 
 Sheila? 
 Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do. 
 What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this. 
 We know that. 
 Who was the man? 
 Never saw him before in my life. 
 Did you tell the police this? 
 We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night. 
 What happened to me? 
 PETE (CON'T) Please tell me. 
 No. 
 Why didn't you tell me you brought me here that night? (he listens) To my house... my parents told me.  What are you tryin' to hide? (he listens) Sheila... Tell me... Who was with me?... Who was the man?... (he listens) ...When you brought me home! (he listens) What was he doin' there? (he listens) What are you cryin' about?...  Sheila? 
 MR. EDDY How ya doin', Pete? 
 Okay. 
 MR. EDDY I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde?  She stayed in the car?... 
 (very quietly) What? 
 MR. EDDY I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes. 
 (voiceover) I'll get it. 
 Hello. 
 Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes. 
 (hesitates) Okay. 
 Up here... Come on. 
 ALICE (CON'T) I already got the room. 
 He'll kill us. 
 Are you positive he knows? 
 I'm not positive... but... he knows. 
 So what do we do? 
 I don't know. 
 We should stop seeing each other. 
 No... no. 
 ALICE (CON'T) I don't want to live without you. 
 ALICE (CON'T) We have to get away... We have to get some money. 
 ALICE (CON'T) I know a guy... He pays girls to party with him... He always has alotta cash... 
 ALICE (CON'T) He'd be easy to rob... Then we'd have the money... and we could get away ... We'd be together. 
 Have you partied with him? 
 I used to. 
 You like it? 
 No, honey... It was part of the deal. 
 What deal? 
 He works for Mr. Eddy. 
 What's he do? 
 He makes films for Mr. Eddy. 
 Pornos. 
 Yeah. 
 How'd you get in with these fuckin' people? 
 Pete... Don't... 
 How'd it happen, Alice? 
 It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends.  He told me about a job... 
 In pornos? 
 No... A job... I didn't know what.  He set up an appointment for me to see a man. 
 ALICE'S STORY 
 (voiceover) I went to this place... They made me wait forever.  There was some guy guardin' the door... I started gettin' nervous... In another room I could see some guy liftin' (MORE) 
 Why didn't you just leave? 
 PETE (CON'T) You liked it. 
 If you want me to go away, I'll go away. 
 I don't want you to go away. 
 (whispers) I love you, Pete. 
 (desperate whisper) I love you, Alice. 
 So, should I call Andy? 
 Andy? 
 That's his name...Andy.  Our ticket out of here. 
 Yeah.  Call him. 
 I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus ... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay? 
 Okay... 
 Lemme call him now.  Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night. 
 Okay.

 ALICE (CON'T) Set. 
 Why are ya goin' so early? 
 'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby. 
 What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy? 
 Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny. 
 What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight? 
 I'm not goin' home tonight ... I'm goin' somewhere else.. (off his look) To a girlfriend's house. (she smiles) But, we still have a coupla things to take care of... 
 Oh, yeah?... What else? 
 This... and this. 
 ALICE (CON'T) Are you my man? 
 (getting hotter) Yes. 
 Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete? 
 ALICE (CON'T) Are you?

 (total horror) THERE'S SOMEONE WITH HIM!! 
 (frightened) Sheila? 
 Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here? 
 You've been fucking somebody else haven't you? 
 Sheila... 
 You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is. 
 Hey... Sheila.

 YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!! YOU'RE SORRY!! 
 SHEILA (CON'T)

 Sheila... Stop...

 Why don't you two come inside and talk things over quietly... Come on... Come on in, Sheila. 
 (to Pete) You are different. 
 Sheila... 
 (to Bill) TELL HIM! 
 Sheila... Don't. 
 I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton... I won't bother you or any member of your family again. 
 Pete... There's a man on the phone.  He's called a couple of times tonight. 
 Who is it? 
 He won't give his name. 
 Hello. 
 MR. EDDY (phone voice) Hey, Pete... How ya doin'? 
 Who is this? 
 MR. EDDY You know who it is. 
 Mr. Eddy? 
 MR. EDDY Yeah... How ya doin', Pete? 
 Okay. 
 MR. EDDY You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete. 
 Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ... 
 MR. EDDY I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete. 
 MR. EDDY You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right? 
 Yeah. 
 MR. EDDY That's good, Pete.  Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine. 
 We've met before, haven't we? 
 I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met? 
 At your house.  Don't you remember? 
 No. No, I don't. 
 We just killed a couple of people... 
 What? 
 You heard me... We thought we'd come over and tell you about it. 
 What's goin' on? 
 Great question!! In the east ... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think?  It's been a pleasure talking to you. 
 MR. EDDY Pete... I just wanted to jump on and tell you I'm really glad you're doin' okay. 
 You got him. 
 (still holding the figurine) Alice, I... 
 (amazement - no feeling) Wow! 
 ALICE (CON'T) Put this in your pocket. 
 ALICE (CON'T) You all right? 
, We killed him. 
 You killed him. 
 Alice? 
 It was an accident... Accidents happen every day. 
 Alice... 
 (pushing back) We gotta get the stuff and get out of here. 
 Is that you?  Are both of them you? 
 That's me. 
 ALICE (CON'T) Pete?... 
 Where's the bathroom? 
 Up the stairs - down the hall. 
 WOMAN/ALICE (to Pete) Did you want to talk to me? 
 WOMAN/ALICE 
 (CON'T) (laughs) Did you want to ask me "why"? 
 Don't you trust me, Pete?... 
 ALICE (CON'T) Stick that in your belt. 
 ALICE (CON'T) (going through the loot) Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car... (looks up at him) We can go anywhere. 
 Alice? 
 Come on, baby. 
 You drive. 
 Come on. 
 ALICE (CON'T) We have to go to the desert.  He's at his cabin. 
 We'll have to wait. 
 Why me, Alice?  Why choose me? 
 So we can be together... You still want to be with me, don't you Pete? 
 ALICE (CON'T) More than ever? 
. 
 I want you... I want you... 
 You'll never have me. 
 Here I am. 
 Alice who? 
 
 (CON'T) Her name is Renee.  If she's told you her name is Alice, she's lying. (filled now with anger) AND YOUR NAME, WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR 
?! 
 You just got in before the big storm hits. 
 Hey, Al, look at this. 
 It's her, all right.  Fred Madison's wife ... with Dick Laurent and Mr. Dent- head over there. 
 We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place. 
 You know what I think? 
 What's that, Ed? 
 There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.

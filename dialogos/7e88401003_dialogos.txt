 
 (V.O.) When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.  Otherwise, what's the point? And, for a while... I believed that's the kind of love I had. 
 (V.O.) Before I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good, that whenever I bet, I could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... 
 
 (V.O.) ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details. 
 (V.O.) At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers flew in every year on their own nickel, and left behind about a billion dollars. But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas... 
 (V.O.) But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved. 
 (V.O.) Who could resist? Anywhere else in the country, I was a bookie, a gambler, always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino. And that's like selling dreams for cash. 
 (V.O.) I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work. 
 (Introducing the EXECS to ACE) ...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room... 
 (V.O.) For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit... 
 (V.O.) ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, what do you think we're doing out here in the middle of the desert? It's all this money. This is the end result of all the bright lights and the comped trips, of all the champagne and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get your money. That's the truth about Las Vegas. 
 (V.O.) We're the only winners. The players don't stand a chance. And their cash flows from the tables to our boxes ...through the cage and into the most sacred room in the casino ...the place where they add up all the money ...the holy of holies ...the count room. 
 (V.O.) Now this place was off limits. 
 #1 Verify two thousand. 
 (V.O.) Even I couldn't get inside, but it was my job to keep it filled with cash. That's for sure. 
 #2 Five thousand. 
 #1 Verify five thousand. 
 #1 Verify two hundred. 
 Hey, John, how are you? How was your ride? 
 Somethin' smells good. 
 Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat. 
 Did you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano? 
 Jerry Steriano? 
 Yeah. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER That man's here again. 
 (O.S.) When you've finished with him, I want him. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER (Carrying a plate of food to the table where BORELLI and FORLANO are seated.) Here you are, gentlemen. 
 You got a round figure on it? 
 (Picking up the suitcase) About twenty pounds. 
 So? 
 That's around seven hundred thousand. 
 Uh-huh, good. 
 (Off-screen, from following scene) I know it's a little early for Las Vegas... 
 
 (O.S.) ...but I do want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry. 
 (V.O.) As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy. 
 This is a very auspicious occasion. 
 (V.O.) A powerful man. 
 Philip, if you would rise. 
 (V.O.) He even played golf with the President. 
 On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . . 
 (V.O.) But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... 
 (Handing GREEN a large cardboard facsimile 'check') ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers. 
 (V.O.) ...he did what he was told. 
 
 You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me. 
 You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog. 
 But what happens when they do find out? 
 Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license. 
 (Exhales) It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way. 
 You got it. 
 I'm serious. No interference. 
 Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it. 
 (Approaching the DEALER) Where the hell did you learn how to deal? (He reaches down, stacking and arranging the chips.) 
 (To the chastised 
) Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I'll take Columbia for twenty. 
 Twenty dimes on Columbia . . . 
 #1 (Into phone) Ace got down at six. 
 #2 (Into phone) Charlie, hey. Rothstein got six. 
 (Slams down his cards and curses at his losing hands) Ma che cazzo! 
 That's enough now! 
 Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American slang for 'Fuck off'] (Summoning a young man.) Johnny! 
 Ace. 
 Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it? 
 Well, that's why they paid so well. 
 You see? (Chuckles.) Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week? 
 Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right? 
 Okay. You come by the house? 
 I'll come by. 
 Seven o'clock? 
 Seven o'clock. 
 Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay, Ace? 
 (To NICKY) Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here'] 
 T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? (pointing to the off- screen ACE) 
 Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him. 
 Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay? 
 Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you'] 
 Fine. 
 (To the BARTENDER) Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies. 
 (O.S.) All right. 
 (V.O.) Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us. 
 (V.O.) How did Nicky collect? 
 They pay every week, like they're supposed to. 
 (V.O.) Don't ask. 
 Hi, Melissa. Heidi. 
 Hi, Sam. 
 (To the GIRLS) Who's this guy? 
 (To NICKY) Get the fuck out of here. It was nine. I laid nine. 
 Eight. 
 Well, how come I laid nine? 
 (To JOE) Excuse me. 
 What? 
 (He holds up the pen) Is this yours? Your pen? 
 Yeah, that's my pen. Why? 
 I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost. 
 Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off? 
 Well, I was just offering you the- 
 (Turning his back to talk to the girls, referring to ACE) This fuckin' asshole. 
 #1 (To JOE) Look out! 
 #1 Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out! 
 (Over whimpers and pants) Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy. 
 (V.O.) While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead. 
 (V.O.) In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced- in local cowboys working. They were close to the, you know, good old boys. 
 (To SHERBERT) Pay him six hundred a week, tell him to walk around and look smart. 
 (V.O.) I mean, without us, these guys, they'd still be shovellin' mule shit. 
 Ward, you gotta keep a cleaner station. If you need 'Mr Clean', page him, all right? 
 It won't happen again, Sam. 
 Mr Rothstein. 
 (To SHERBERT) Is this guy just another dumb fuckin' white man, or what? What's his story? 
 We need this guy. 
 We can't get rid of him? 
 He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin. 
 I wouldn't give the bum a mop job. 
 (V.O.) These yokels ran the state. 
 #1 Thank you very much, Senator. 
 (V.O.) They passed the laws, they owned the courts. 
 Hi, Ace. 
 Hello, Senator. 
 (To ACE) Hey, I need a room. Need a room. 
 Good to see ya. (To SHERBERT) William would you... 
 (V.O.) I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week. 
 Nice to see you, Senator. 
 (To SHERBERT) Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants. 
 Certainly. (Leads the way.) Senator. 
 (V.O.) Why not make them happy? 
 We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite. 
 (V.O.) For politicians... 
 (V.O.) ...like our state senator up there, everything was on the house. 
 (V.O.) These guys won their comped life when they got elected. So, hey, why not take advantage of it? Still, the politicians come cheap. We could handle them. 
 (V.O.) It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa, who plays thirty thousand dollars a hand in baccarat. That's the one you really gotta watch. 
 (V.O.) He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit to turn out your lights. About a year ago, he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands. 
 (V.O.) Downstairs, he takes us for two million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels. Another billionaire cheapskate who loves his free rooms... 
 (V.O.) ...free private jets, and two million of our money. 
 Nice to see you again. 
 (V.O.) But we got him back. I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz. 
 Ken, I don't know what the hell went wrong. I'm awfully sorry. 
 This is a big problem. Big problem. 
 I can't understand it. These mechanical things, you know, they happen. Hey, be-better here than (gesturing to the sky) up there, you know what I mean? 
 (V.O.) Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan. 
 I'm so sorry. There's a convention in town, and all flights are booked. 
 A convention? (Turning to ICHIKAWA) I can't believe that there's a convention. It's never... ? 
 What can I do? 
 (V.O.) We got him back ...with a whole floor of rooms for himself. 
 I'm sorry you missed the plane. 
 You want to get my money back, right? (Chuckles) 
 No, no, no. No gambling. No. 
 (V.O.) He bet one thousand a hand instead of his usual thirty thousand a hand. 
 The bank wins a natural eight over a five. 
 (V.O.) But I knew, the trick with whales like Ichikawa was that they can't bet small for long. He didn't think of it as winning ten thousand, he thought of it as losing ninety thousand. 
 (V.O.) So, he upped his bets... 
 (V.O.) ...until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash. 
 (V.O.) In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing... 
 (V.O.) ...and keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose. In the end, we get it all. 
 (V.O.) In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else. 
 Six, an easy way. Six! All right, who's gonna give me... 
 (V.O.) Since the players are looking to beat the casino... 
 ...both dice must hit that back wall each and every roll. All right, make a six! 
 (V.O.) ...the dealers are watching the players. 
 Gimme a six! 
 Come on, baby, make a six! 
 (V.O.) The box men are watching the dealers. 
 (Humming, fielding, every roll.) 
. 
 (V.O.) The floor men are watching the box men. 
 (V.O.) The pit bosses are watching the floor men. 
 (V.O.) The shift bosses are watching the pit bosses. 
 (V.O.) The casino manager is watching the shift bosses. 
 (V.O.) I'm watching the casino manager. 
 (V.O.) And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all. 
 (V.O.) Plus... 
 (V.O.) ...we had a dozen guys up there, most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house. 
 Come on, come on. 
 Yes! 
 Thank you. Very nice. 
 (Chuckles) I told you I was hot tonight. 
 (Off-screen) Let's go. This is for Ginger. Come on. This is for Ginger. 
 #1 Let me have a hundred on the hard ten. Thank you. 
 #2 Hard ten. One hundred. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (To the table) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. 
 Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast. 
 Ginger, honey. 
 Thank you very much, now. 
 Ginger, honey, this is for you love. Thanks for your time. 
 (Chuckles) Come on. 
 What's the matter? 
 What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut. 
 What money? I've seen you stealing from me. 
 What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end. 
 Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me. 
 Don't give me that shit. I want my money. 
 That bag's full of fuckin' chips you 
 (Interrupts) What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you. 
 Get lost, Ginger! Get lost! 
 Get lost? 
 Yes. 
 Get lost? 
 Yes. 
 Well, how 'bout that? 
 Come on! (He bends down to pick them up.) 
 (V.O.) What a move. I fell in love right there. 
 (V.O.) But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money. 
 I'm going to go powder my nose. (ACE hands a single $50 bill. She smiles coyly. He hands her another fifty.) 
 (V.O.) Ginger's mission in life was money. 
 I'll be right back. 
 (O.S.) (from following scene) See you, Ginger. 
 Okay, thank you for asking. 
 (V.O.) She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money. 
 (To VALET PARKERS) Hello. 
 Hey, Ginger, how you doin'? 
 Great. (Handing the VALET some money.) And I have something for you. You got me covered? 
 Yes. Something for you, there. 
 And you do. Thank you very much. 
 Take care of yourself. 
 I got some lucky pills for you, honey. 
 #2 Oh, yeah? 
 (V.O.) Who didn't want Ginger? She was one of the best-known, best-liked and most respected hustlers in town. Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake for two or three days before sending him home broke to the little woman and his bank examiners. 
 Any change? 
 (Chuckles) I hit a few... uh, games on the way back. 
 (V.O.) That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash. 
 (To CASHIER) How you doin' tonight? 
 Good. How are you? 
 (Sighing) Oh, beat. 
 (V.O.) Ginger had the hustler's code. 
 Okay. 
 Take one for you. 
 (While she counts out the cash) Thank you. 
 (V.O.) She knew how to take care of people. And that's what Vegas was all about. 
 (As she pushes a stack of $100 bills across the counter) Sixty-eight hundred. 
 Thanks 
 You're welcome. 
 (V.O.) It's Kickback City. 
 You have a good night. 
 Thank you. You too. 
 (V.O.) She took care of the dealers... 
 Hey, Mitch. 
 (V.O.) ...pit bosses, floor managers. 
 Thank you. 
 (V.O.) But mostly... 
 (V.O.) ...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 Thank you, Ginger. 
 (V.O.) Ginger took care of the parkers because they took care of the security guards, who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate. 
 #3 Thank you, Ginger. 
 (Getting into her car) I need that stuff tonight. 
 #3 No problem. 
 You're a doll. 
 (V.O.) The valet parking job was such a money-maker that they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession. 
 (V.O.) But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond. 
 Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay? 
 All right. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you? 
 I'm here. 
 No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you? 
 I'm always here for you. 
 You are. 
 I am. 
 (V.O.) The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep. 
 Good luck. 
 Yeah. 
 (V.O.) He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks. 
 Careful. 
 (V.O.) I mean, the guy was always broke, he always had a story. And somehow, she could never turn him down. The way Ginger saw it, I guess, was that Lester was just an unlucky guy. Somebody had to take care of him. 
 (V.O.) But nobody had to take care of Nicky. 
 (V.O.) I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him. 
 (To customs agent) Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ! 
 (V.O.) Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport. 
 #1 (To MARINO) Excuse me. 
 (V.O.) I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp. 
 Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please? 
 (V.O.) They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened. 
 (To LITTLE NICKY) You go and put your things away. 
 (V.O.) And they were usually right. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 (V.O.) Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it. 
 Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful. 
 (V.O.) I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas. 
 All right, we're clear. 
 I think that's it. 
 God, I'm telling you, they're out! 
 Look, there aren't... (A diamond falls out of her beehive.) There aren't but... 
 
 (Opening door) Hey. 
 Hey, how you doin'? (Kisses ACE.) 
 (Whispering) Wow. 
 Incredible. 
 Welcome to Vegas. 
. 
 Somethin', huh? 
 (Calling her over) Ginger. 
 Honey, come here. 
 This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine. 
 (Shaking hands) Good to meet you. 
 Hi, Jennifer. 
 Hi, how are you? 
 (V.O.) After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it. 
 No, of course not. 
 Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here. 
 Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit. 
 Of course. 
 (V.O.) Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky? (Chuckles.) Nicky was the muscle. 
 Hey. 
 How you doin'? 
 What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'. 
 You sure? 
 Well, I'm a little confused here. 
 Yeah. 
 (Groaning) I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it. 
 (Gasps) My fuckin' head. 
 (Pointing to TONY) Smarten up. 
 (O.S.) (From following scene) And now... 
 ...Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first president. 
 (V.O.) But still, it was nice and quiet for a while. Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town, like regular Ozzie and Harriets. 
 (To LITTLE NICKY) Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing. 
 Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game. 
 Now go out there and show your dad what you can do. 
 You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does. 
 It's instinctive, you know. 
 (V.O.) And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known. 
 (V.O.) Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message. 
 (Shakes NICKY's hand) Hey, Nicky. How are you? 
 Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here? 
 JERRY/EDDY (In unison) You're over here? 
 You're over here? 
 Oh. 
 Oh. 
 We're waiting on Carmine. 
 Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine. 
 Carmine left? 
 Carmine left? 
 He's gone? 
 He's not here? 
 Carmine's gone. 
 Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? (Shakes hands with NICKY.) 
 (Shakes NICKY's hand) Yeah, lots of luck. Lots of luck. 
 (To NICKY from behind the cage) Hey, they forgot to sign their papers. 
 They forgot to sign their papers. 
 (V.O.) Out of respect, guys from other crews got away with a warning. 
 (V.O.) Everybody else: watch out. 
 (V.O.) Like these yokels here who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home, 'cause they're the morons who give you the most trouble. Even after we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin' back with beards and wigs and fake noses. 
 (V.O.) You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet. Like this guy. He's bettin' lavender chips at five hundred each with only one little problem. He's always guessed right. If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot. But in the end, they're all greedy. 
 (V.O.) I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it. 
 (V.O.) He just wasn't protecting his hand. He was lifting his hole card way to high. 
. 
 (V.O.) Now, here's this guy... 
 (V.O.) ...reading the dealer's hole card... 
 (V.O.) ...and signaling his buddy [the WINNER] at this table. 
 (V.O.) And that's just what these hustlers look for. They cruise from casino to casino, lookin' for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope. 
 (O.S.) (From following scene) Operator? 
 This is Mr R. Get me Armstrong and Friday over at pit two right away. 
 (To ARMSTRONG) BJ nineteen, second base, the beard [Blackjack table number 19, second position, man with the beard] 
 (Picks up the phone again.) Operator... I need Mr Happy, loud. 
 (In unison) Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday, dear Jeff. Happy Birthday to you. 
 #1 Man down! 
 #1 Notify medical! We got a cardiac arrest here! 
 #2 He's fine, folks. Just give us some room, please! 
 (V.O.) Watch it now. 
 #1 (O.S.) Stand back! 
 (V.O.) They never know what hit them. And if and when... 
 (V.O.) ...they do find out they just got zapped by a cattle prod... 
 (V.O.) ...they wish they really did have a heart attack. 
 (V.O.) Turns out this guy and his fuckin' pals, they were knockin' this place dead for years. 
 #1 He's got a wire on him. 
 Hey, hey, what are you doin', man? 
 #2 (Exposing the device) There it is! On the table! 
 #1 Cheater's justice! 
 (In pain) Oh, God! Oh! 
 Hey, no! No! No! 
 (V.O.) We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over. 
 (To relieved SIGNALER) I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands? 
 No. 
 Can't do it with both hands? 
 No, Sir. 
 Can you do it with your left hand? 
 Well, I... I never tried. 
 So, you're a righty? 
 Ye-yeah. 
 Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand. 
 God! (He moans and sits back.) 
 (O.S.) (From following scene) It's a hundred... 
 ...a hundred ten. 
 Yes, it is. 
 I think. 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public. 
 Yeah. 
 (To CASHIER) Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh? 
 Yes. 
 A little privacy. And, by the way, send over a... nice bottle of champagne on ice, huh? 
 Sure will. 
 Real special.  Somethin'... (To WINNER.) By the way...  I'm Billy Sherbert, your casino manager. 
 Hi. 
 Having a good time? 
 Yes, uh... 
 You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need... 
 Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings? 
 Look what they did to my hand, man! 
 (Walks over to the 
) All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want? 
 I just wanna get out of here. 
 And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand? 
 I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake. 
 You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it? 
 Yeah. 
 Get out of here. 
 Thank you. 
 (To the GUARDS, referring to the 
) Throw him out in the alley.  And just tell the cops he got hit by a car. 
 (V.O.) Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot. 
 We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around? 
 What, are you trying to handicap me? 
 I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me? (GINGER looks doubtful.) I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family. 
 (Sighs, laughing) You got the wrong girl, Sam. 
 I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother. 
 You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know? 
 I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore. 
 You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't. 
 Yeah, I know all that. 
 I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you. 
 (Brushing cigarette ash off his dressing gown) I - I - I... 
 Understand? (Pause) I'm sorry. 
 No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that. 
 If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me? 
 You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine. 
 (Interrupts) What're you... what're you pitching me, here? 
 Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you. (Pause) Want to take a chance? 
 (V.O.) When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.' 
 (Over telephone) Can you feel my eyes on you? Can you feel me look into your heart?  Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach? Can you feel me in you? In your heart? 
 Don't make me come there. Answer me. 
 (Over telephone, sobbing) I love you. 
 (Into telephone) Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too? 
 (Over telephone) No, Lester. 
 (Into telephone) Do you know that? 
 (Over telephone) Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now. 
 (Into telephone) That's right. 
 (Over telephone) So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it? 
 (Sobbing, into telephone) Promise? 
 (Over telephone) God... I wish you... 
 (Into telephone) ...all the luck in the world. 
 (Over telephone) You do? 
 (Into telephone) Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas. 
 (Over telephone) Come on, this is great for us. You know I'm gonna be here for you. I ain't going no place. Huh?  I'm lookin' at you right now. I'm seein' you for the very first time, right this minute. I'm seein' you, and I can feel my heart click. I see you fourteen years old. I see you the first second I ever saw you. I see you, long-legged little colt - 
 - with stupid braces on your teeth. 
 (Into telephone, sniffing, trying to cut him off) Okay, then. 
 (Over telephone) Every time I ever see you, that's what I see. 
 (Into telephone) Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. (She hangs up the phone quickly.) 
 You all right? 
 (Drinking some champagne, wiping away tears) Yeah. 
 Why're you crying? 
 (Laughs) I'm not crying. (Sniffs.) 
 Maybe you shouldn't drink so much. 
 I'm okay. I just - (Sniffs) You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay? 
 It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right? 
 Yeah. 
 You're with me now. 
 Yeah. 
 Right? 
 Uh-huh. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Want to go? Let's go back in. 
 (Sniffs) Okay. 
 Oh... 
 (Sighing) It's great. 
 Oh, it's great. 
 (Running into the closet) Oh! It's all my stuff. Oh, my God. 
 You brought all my stuff. I can - 
 Try it on. It's yours. 
 (Whispering) You're kidding? My God. What is it? 
 It's chinchilla. 
 (Looking at herself in the mirror) Oh, it's so soft. 
 It's nice isn't it? 
 Oh... 
 No one's ever been so nice to me. 
 (Gasps) Oh, my God. 
 So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day? 
 You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises? 
 You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either. 
 The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank. 
 (Putting on a gold bracelet) Come on. Can I keep this one in the house? 
 Now look, (gently holding her face, gathering her total attention) pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important. 
 Okay. 
 All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. 
 (V.O.) With over a million in cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas only for Ginger, she was secure and happy. 
 (V.O.) She loved that shit. But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of pay-off cash around. 
 (V.O.) Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks. 
 Need a little help with that, Mr Collins? 
 (V.O.) So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money. 
 (V.O.) And, since I'd either be in jail or locked in a closet when I needed the money the most... 
 (V.O.) ...I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive. 
 Now this is just a signature card. 
 So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself? 
 That's right. 
 That's the way you wanted it, right? 
 (Quietly.) Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife. 
 (Quietly) Yeah, sure I do. Why? 
 No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't. 
 Well... 
 (V.O.) With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered, and to play it safe I switched job titles again and made myself, um, Food and Beverage Director. This way nobody would bother me about a license. I mean, Vegas was like a dream for me. Trouble was... 
 (V.O.) ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas. 
 (To MIKE) Don't make us come lookin' for you. 
 Oh, you won't have to look for me. I appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky. 
 (V.O.) It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy. 
 (Scratching his arm) I'm gonna open for five hundred. 
 Moosh, you open? (Taps his fingers on some chips before picking them up.) 
 (V.O.) Signaling back and forth. 
 I bet thirty-five hundred. 
 I've been losing for three days straight, non-stop. 
 Oh, why're you crying, with three loaves of bread under your arm? 
 (V.O.) Nicky thought nobody was watching him. But he was wrong. 
 (V.O.) And I didn't want any of those agents near my place. 
 (Getting up in disgust) Jesus Christ. I can't believe it. 
 If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck. I'm out of here, you understand? 
 (V.O.) I mean, I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost. 
 (V.O.) What am I gonna do? Go back home and start a war? 
 (V.O.) I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that. 
 (Whispering in NICKY's ear) Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place. 
 You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya. 
 (To SHERBERT, referring to COWBOY) I don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint? 
 Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table and putting your shoes on, please? 
 (Sighs) Yeah, I would mind. I'm havin' a bad night. 
 (Returning to ACE) Fuckin' asshole won't budge. 
 Call security. 
 How are you? 
 Good. How are you? 
 Good. You want to do me a favor? You want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on? 
 Fuck you. 
 (To GUARDS) I want you to exit this guy off the premises, and I want you to exit him off his feet and use his head to open the fuckin' door. 
 #1 Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside? 
 Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you! 
 #1 Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy! 
 Fuck you! Fuck you! 
 #1 Yeah? 
 You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?! 
 #1 Now move along. 
 (Screaming at ACE who follows him) You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with? 
 Leave me alone! 
 #1 Here we go! 
 (Grunting) You've gotta be kidding me! (Groans.) 
 (V.O.) (As COWBOY is thrown out the door) Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call. 
 (Into telephone) No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did? 
 (Over telephone) He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely... 
 (Into telephone) ...and he tells me to go fuck myself. 
 (Into telephone) Then he called me a faggot. 
 (Over telephone) So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out. 
 Nicky, I did - 
 I did - I didn't - 
 (Over telephone) Get up. 
 Get up. 
 (Into telephone) If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again. 
 (Over telephone) Okay. 
 Nicky, I'm sorry. 
 (To SHOWGIRL) You're still eight pounds over. (To MANAGER.) What's the reason for this? 
 Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension. 
 Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'. 
 Well, sir, I was just... 
 Why is she eight pounds over? 
 ...trying to offer you the respect that your... 
 I... 
 ...position... 
 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough. 
 Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows... 
 She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen... 
 ...and she doesn't always - 
 ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer. 
 But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired. 
 That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris. 
 It's always been our policy - 
 No. Just stop everything. 
 (To ACE) This woman's an institution. 
 I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy. 
 (V.O.) Between... 
 (V.O.) ...my innovations... 
 (V.O.) ...and Nicky's dedication to his job... 
 (V.O.) ...I soon had the best operation on the Strip. 
 You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already. 
 I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book. 
 Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you. 
 I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you. 
 #1 Mrs Rothstein, look straight ahead. Very nice. Thank you. 
 #2 Thank you. 
 #1 Yes, nice smile. 
 #3 Just look right at the camera. Hold that pose. 
 (V.O.) Back home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. But out here, they're givin' me awards. 
 (Into the microphone) It's with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation from the... 
 Thank you. 
 He worked so hard. 
 (V.O.) But my greatest pleasure was watchin' my wife, Ginger, work the room. 
 (V.O.) They all loved her. How could you not live her? 
 (To COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3) Hi. Nice to see you. 
 (V.O.) She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her. 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks. Yes, all right. 
 (V.O.) She made everybody feel good. 
 Congratulations, Sam. 
 (Shaking his hand) Oh, thanks. 
 Hello, Mrs Rothstein. 
 Hi. 
 How are you? 
 Oh. 
 You're one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. You're a lucky man Mr Rothstein. 
 Thank you. Thanks for that compliment. 
 (V.O.) He was a young kid from the casino... nice kid...  bright boy. What balls on this fuckin' kid! The next day I fired him. 
 (To AMY) Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much. (She places a gold bracelet on AMY's hand.) Put your arm in there. 
 (V.O.) But as much as they loved her... 
 (To AMY, wearing the bracelet) Oh, fabulous. 
 (V.O.) ...they didn't know what really moved her. 
 Look at this. Look at this. 
 (O.S.) (From the viewing room) Daddy gave me this pin when we were dating. 
 (V.O.) And with Ginger happy, I was able to concentrate on what I knew best. 
 Loose machines are right back over there. 
 What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there. 
 Okay, I'll - 
 What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden. 
 Well... 
 These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front. 
 All right, I will, I will. 
 Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand? 
 I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you. 
 Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this. 
 Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry. 
 (V.O.) So, I ended up workin' what? Eighteen- hour days?  Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas. 
 D' (To JENNIFER) Come with me, please. I have a better table for you.  Sorry. 
 (Sitting down next to 
) So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway? 
 (Smiling) I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein. 
 (Chuckles) Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it. 
 (V.O.) Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it. 
 (Smoking a cigarette) Yeah, I believe it. You got banned. 
 Nope, there's no way. 
 Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is. 
 In so many words, yes. 
 (V.O.) It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care. 
 This peter's a motherfucker. 
 (Grunting) It's workin'. Just keep workin' it. It's comin'. 
 (Over telephone) Listen... 
 (Talking quietly into telephone) ...they're in Penthouse K. 
 (Into telephone) They checked in alone. 
 (Into telephone) Yes, don't worry. 
 (V.O.) He had tipsters... 
 (V.O.) ...all over town. Bellmen. 
 (Into telephone) This one looks good. But you got to hurry. 
 (Over telephone) Yeah... 
 (Into telephone) ...yeah, okay. 
 (V.O.) Valet parkers. 
 (Into telephone) They're just checking in now. 
 (Into telephone, seated on a couch) Okay, I'll tell him. 
 (V.O.) Pit bosses. 
 (Into telephone) Yeah, room twelve-thirty, at the Sirocco. 
 (Into telephone) Twelve-thirty, right. 
 (V.O.) Secretaries. 
 (Into telephone) It's all in mint condition coins. 
 (Into telephone) Mint condition. All right. 
 (V.O.) And they all... 
 (V.O.) ...got a piece of the score. 
 (From inside the van, into a walkie-talkie) Car's comin'. 
 (V.O.) They were always very careful. And they always bypassed the alarms, or else... if not, they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer... 
 (V.O.) Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him. 
 (V.O.) For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fuckin' Wild West. 
 (Leading a detective to his showroom) I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel... 
 No, no, there's no flaws in it. 
 You better clean your fuckin' loupe. 'Cause there's no flaws in these diamonds. 
 What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds? 
 Forty thousand dollars, you can buy the whole package. 
 (To IRANIAN #2) All of a sudden he talks English, now. (To IRANIAN #1.) Let's talk turkey here, how 'bout twenty-five thousand? 
 (Referring to JENNIFER as they pass the kitchen) She asleep? 
 I took care of everybody. 
 Yeah, that works out. 
 You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss. 
 Yes. 
 (To COOK preparing sandwich) Is that the last one? 
 Yeah. 
 (Spits) Fuckers! 
 Here you go, guys. 
 #1 All right. Thanks, a lot. 
 Yeah... yeah, enjoy. 
 #2 Yeah. 
 Have a good time. (Muttering to himself.) Choke on it, ya motherfucker! 
 #1 (Passing DOMINICK on his way out) Hey, Dom. 
 Hey, how you doin'? 
 (V.O.) Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them. 
 (V.O.) In Vegas, he had The Leaning Tower. It was a very popular spot. He had politicians, showgirls and movies stars hangin' out all over the place. 
 By the way, Sammy said whenever you have a minute, give him a call. 
 (Laughs) I'll do anything for a buck. 
 (Chuckles) Thanks. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 (V.O.) But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky liked the most was the showgirls, naturally. I mean, to them, Nicky was the movie star. 
 Hey. This is Shelly. 
 (Pointing to STACY) And this is Stacy. 
 (To the SHOWGIRLS) This is Nick. 
 Hi, Nick. 
 We're gonna have dinner. Come on. 
 When I left here with the money... 
 ...I got muscled on the street. 
 A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did. 
 Yeah. 
 I didn't give 'em the m- 
 Thanks, Nick. 
 (V.O.) But around six-thirty in the morning when he finished his day - 
 (V.O.) - no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy. 
 Remo. 
 Hey, Frankie. 
 How are you? 
 Fine, fine. 
 Nicky sends his warmest regards. 
 Uh-huh. Good. 
 And how are things going down there? 
 Fine. Everything's goin' good. 
 (V.O.) (From his office) Frankie... 
 ...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand? 
 I'll take care of it, Remo. 
 E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!'] 
 (To NICKY) Yeah, thanks a lot. 
 (With what strength he as left) Fuck you! 
 Ch-Charlie M! 
 (Blood streaming out of his mouth) Charlie M. 
 (Pleading) Kill me, you fuck, kill me. 
 (V.O.) The word got around that finally... 
 (V.O.) ...there was a real gangster in town. Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas. 
 Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are? 
 Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more. 
 Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me? 
 Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you. 
 You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on? 
 Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam. 
 Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won! 
 Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes. 
 Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels. 
 The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win? 
 I really think you're - 
 (Interrupts) You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win? 
 I really think you're overreacting in this whole - 
 (Interrupts) Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here. 
 You're firin' me? 
 I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin' (mocking WARD) I'm firin' you, you - 
 You might regret this, Mr Rothstein. 
 I'll regret it even more if I keep you on. 
 This is not the way to treat people. 
 Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on. (To SHERBERT.) Let's go. 
 I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History. 
 So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it. 
 Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here. 
 Look at yours. 
 Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing. 
 It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done. 
 (Handing the BAKER the two muffins) From now on I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin. An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin. 
 You know how long that's going to take? 
 I don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin. 
 Come on, honey, just a little. That a girl, that a girl. Oh, boy, look. 
 (To AMY, who is sobbing and mumbling) Okay, want to go with Mommy? 
 What do you need? 
 (Giving AMY to the 
) You get her?  Okay. (To ACE.) Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual. 
 Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there. 
 Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand. 
 Twenty-five thousand? For yourself? 
 (Picking up an empty carton of milk) Yeah. 
 Why do you need that much? 
 Well, what's the difference? I just need it. 
 Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean... 
 I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal. (Getting up to the refrigerator.) Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself. 
 Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for. 
 Why can't you tell me what it's for? 
 Huh? (Pause) Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat? 
 No. 
 Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that? 
 Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this. 
 What are you talkin' a- ? 
 (Interrupting) Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad? 
 You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you? (She doesn't answer.) Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you? 
 (Quietly) You can trust me. 
 Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for. 
 What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean? 
 It means I got the money. 
 You got money. That's a - That's a good look. 
 How you doin', Les? It's Lester, right? Sam. 
 From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler... the pimp from Beverly Hills? 
 If I'm wrong, please correct me, 'cause I never knew you to be a heist man. (LESTER sighs.) But if you are, you know what... here, take mine too. 
 Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already have hers. 
 She's my wife. (To LESTER.) Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me. 
 Yeah, yeah. I know that. 
 You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here. 
 (Quietly) Okay. 
 You fuckin' piece of shit. 
 Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck? 
 You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he? 
 (Whispering) No, he didn't. 
 (Picks up the money) Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.' 
 Come here, I want to show you somethin'. 
 #1 You fuckin' shit. 
 No! No! No! Don't! 
 Make them stop it! (Sobbing.) No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's my fault! 
 (Sobbing) No! No! 
 (Falling into the front seat on his back.) Fuck! 
 Fuck you! 
 #2 You piece of shit. 
 (As ACE and GINGER drive off down the street) Couldn't do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker! 
 (Throwing the iron on the counter) He's such a prick. He had some guy from the hotel beat him up. He didn't want to do it himself. Oh, no, he didn't want to get his own hands dirty. 
 So, why'd he have to do that, huh? 
 Tell me. 
 (Interrupts) Yeah, no shit. 
 No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise. 
 Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what? 
 Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end. 
 Am I right? 
 So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry. 
 Mm, you want to steal it? (Cracking a smile.) 
 I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. (Sniffs.) 
 I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality. (Breaking down.) Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake. (Sniffs.) I mean it. 
 I do. 
 He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him. 
 He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about? 
 (Sighs, her voice starts to crack) He gives a fuck what I do? 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. (Walking over to him, smiling.) Thanks. 
 Thanks for puttin' up with me. 
 Oh, come on. 
 (Fidgeting with his jacket, then holding his face in her hands, smiling.) You're so nice. (She begins to cry.) 
 (Tenderly strokes his head) Thanks. 
 (Through tears) Thank you. 
 (Into telephone) Mr Rothstein? County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you. 
 (Over telephone) Okay... 
 (Into telephone) ...give me a minute. 
 (Over telephone) Okay. 
 (To WEBB) It'll just be a minute. 
 Mr Webb...  Can I get you anything? 
 Oh, no. (Cordially tipping his hat.) No, thank you, little lady. 
 (Into telephone) Okay, send him in and call me four minutes after. 
 Mr Rothstein... (With hand outstretched to ACE.) I'm Pat Webb. 
 How do you do? 
 Hey, it is my pleasure. 
 Yeah, I heard a lot about you. 
 Oh, thank you, sir. 
 Hey, house is doin' well. (Chuckling.) Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant. 
 No, that's quite all right. 
 Why don't you have a seat? 
 Hm? Oh. Thank you, sir. 
 Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired. 
 I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here. 
 Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges. 
 Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest. 
 Are, uh - (Clears throat.) - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro? 
 I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him. 
 (Chuckling) You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar. (Chuckles.) But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back. 
 I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that. 
 Well, could there be any position... further down the trough? 
 (Pause) I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted. 
 (Into telephone) Okay, thanks. (To WEBB.) Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry. 
 Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor. (Pause.) Thank you for your time. 
 No problem. (Getting up and shaking hands.) Sorry. 
 (Smiles slightly) You bet. 
 What happened to my pills? 
 Huh? 
 (Waving the pill bottle) Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too? 
 I didn't take your pills. 
 Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em? 
 (Sobbing) You didn't have to beat him up! 
 (Walking back to the bathroom) What? 
 (Sobbing) I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy! 
 Yeah, how do I know? 
 (Sobbing) You can't make me stop caring... 
 What? What?! 
 I said, you can't make me stop caring about people. 
 (Trying to calm her) Listen. (Stepping up to the bed.) Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think - 
 (Interrupts) You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here. (Crying.) I am. 
 (Walking around the bed to her) It's okay.  Look... (holding her face, gently) ...you gotta get a hold of yourself. 
 Okay. 
 If not for me, at least for Amy. 
 (Sobbing) Okay, okay. 
 (Gently) You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones. 
 I don't need one. 
 Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff. 
 That's all you care about. (Collapsing on the edge of the bed.) You don't care about me at all. 
 (Bending down to her) Yes, I - yes, I do. 
 No, you don't. 
 How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody. (Strokes her hair. Then, quietly:) You can do it. (Kissing her.) You can do it. 
 (Sobbing) Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try. 
 I'll try. I will. Don't be mad at me, okay... I will. 
 Aspett'. [Italian-American slang for 'Wait'] Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that the money we're robbing is bein' robbed? That somebody's robbing from us?  We go through all this fuckin' trouble, and somebody's robbin' us? 
 (To NANCE) Eh? 
 Like I said, you know, i-it's part of the business. I-it's considered leakage. 
 Leakage, my balls. I want the guy who's robbin' us. 
 What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed? Defeats the whole purpose of what we're doin' out there. 
 (To NANCE) Huh? 
 You know, they take this money because they're my guys. So you gotta give 'em some leeway. 
 What the hell have you been doin' out there? 
 I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.] 
 Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma? 
 What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.] 
 Artie, what the hell have you been doin' out there, Artie? 
 I'm out there more than I'm here. 
 You gotta go back there and talk to that guy. 
 Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip. 
 What expenses? 
 Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on? 
 You gotta go back out there. 
 Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records. 
 Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes? 
 Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here? 
 You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me. 
 (V.O.) No matter how many novenas you could make, nothin'... 
 (V.O.) ...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino. 
 We made a deal. You came to me, remember? 
 (V.O.) It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers... 
 Because you're wrong. 
 Yes, you are. 
 (V.O.) ...Green tried to stonewall her. 
 And you're not going to get away with this! I will see to it that you do not get away with this! 
 (V.O.) So... 
 (V.O.) ...she sued him in court. 
 The court will now hear the matter of the plaintiff, Anna Scott, against Tangiers Corporation and its president, Philip Green. 
 #1 Good morning, your Honor. John Momet on behalf of Mr Green. 
 #2 Mitchell Logan on behalf of Anna Scott, your Honor. 
 Mr Logan, you may proceed. 
 #2 Thank you, Judge. 
 I believe he was absolutely fair and I'm delighted with the decision. 
 (Into telephone) We got a problem. 
 HOME - DAY 
 (Over telephone) It didn't go too well. 
 (As GREEN and his lawyers walk past him, exiting the court-house) Green has to open up the books... has to show how he got the financing. And, hey, that's - that's not good. 
 HOME - DAY 
 Shit. 
 #1 Can you comment on the murder of Anna Scott? 
 #1 (O.S.) She was found last night, shot in the head. 
 #2 (O.S.) Was this just a real-estate partnership? 
 #3 (O.S.) Her lawyer said you were partners. 
 #1 Police are calling this a mob-style killing. 
 #2 Did you ever hear of the twenty-two- caliber killer? 
 (V.O.) Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky... 
 (V.O.) ...clean front man. So, I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew the casino was on the up and up. 
 So, actually, how often do you really fill in for him? 
 (to REPORTER, who looks his way.) Green's here about two or three times a month, and he's busy - (REPORTER glances back at ACE.) - with other real-estate deals and - and things, you know. 
 (To ACE) So, in Green's absence, then, you're the boss. 
 I serve at the pleasure of the chairman of the board and... my, uh, responsibilities are to run the day- to-day operations. 
 So, day-to-day, then, you're the boss? 
 Well, in a sense, you could say that... I am the boss, when Mr Green is away. You could say that. 
 (O.S.) Hm. Have you read this? 
 (O.S.) Hm? It's 'bout Mr Rothstein. 
 It says (Reading) 'The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties says that he is the real boss of the new hundred-million-dollar Tangiers Casino empire.' (To DUPREY and AUSTIN) You believe that? 
 Did he really say that? 
 Why, of course, he really said that. It's right here. Has that man even filed for his license yet? 
 I don't know. We'll have to check the files. 
 Well, without gettin' your shorts in a knot, would you do that? And kinda check closely, 'cause we may have to kick a kike's ass out of town.  Thank you. 
 (On television) A Gaming Control Board investigation of Tangiers executive Sam Rothstein's application for a (photo of ACE) gaming license is underway. Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers Casino operation and is a boyhood friend of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro, (photo of NICKY) Could lose his ability to work in the casino. 
 (Into telephone) Hello. 
 'I gotta meet Charlie the Banker right away at your house, okay?' 
 (Into telephone) No, you, you can't. You gotta make a reservation. 
 (Into telephone) It's all booked up. 
 'I don't want a meeting at my house.' 
 (Into telephone) It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's... 
 (Into telephone) ...very difficult to get in. 
 'I'll come in from the golf course side. See you at six.' 
 (Over telephone) Uh... 
 (Over telephone) ...all right. 
 (On television, from following scene) The battle between... 
 (On television) ...state gaming officials and Tangiers Casino boss Sam 'Ace' Rothstein is heating up. Tonight, an up-to-the- minute look at Ace Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing despite law enforcement allegations of Rothstein's organized crime connections. Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with alleged organized crime figure Nicky Santoro keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers Casino?  And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship? 
 (Quietly) Why don't you take it easy with that stuff? Huh?  Come on. Let me help you. Come on. We're talkin' about some stuff. 
 (On television) State officials say 'yes' when that relationship and those connections are with anyone as notorious as Nicky Santoro. 
 Tonight at six: 'Will a boyhood friendship unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers' Casino boss?' Exclusive on the KVVO Special News Report. (Reading commercial.) ...Promise to keep my money fears away? 
 (To GINGER) Just go downstairs.  Just... go downst- 
 (On television, continuing commercial) Promise to be financially secure? Money Time can help you keep those promises. 
 You can't let this concern you, Ace. Don't worry about that stuff. 
 (O.S.) It's just a political witch hunt. 
 Hey. 
 Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill? 
 Yeah, refill'd be great. 
 (Shaking hands) Hi. Good. 
 Well, I've been busy. (Chuckles.) 
 Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss. 
 (Chuckling) What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me? 
 (As he puts a notepad in his briefcase) You can't talk to me like... 
 (To ACE, panting) Sam? 
 (Walking to NICKY) What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the 
. 
 I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head? 
 Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand? 
 No, I don't wanna come - 
 I don't wanna come along with you. 
 I'll be honest with you. 
 I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about... 
 ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it. 
 That's all taken out of context. Okay. 
 I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened. 
 Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad. 
 Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad. 
 What happened to me? What happened to you? 
 You lost your control. 
 Yes, you lost your control. 
 All right. 
 All right. 
 Yeah. 
 My wife? 
 Now, what does she have to do with all this? 
 All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation? 
 Listen, I would - 
 I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you. 
 Please... 
 ...don't do it to me... 
 Okay? 
 Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that. 
 That's right, yeah. 
 Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy. 
 This guy is gonna run to the FBI. 
 (V.O.) I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it. 
 (V.O.) Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody. 
 (V.O.) Plus, he had stopped askin' permission from back home for every little thing. 
 (V.O.) A casino boss and his wife were killed. The bulls questioned Nicky. 
 (V.O.) A dealer from the Sirocco... they questioned Nicky. 
 (V.O.) A bunch of stool pigeons wound in the trunks of their cars... they questioned Nicky. 
 (V.O.) A lawyer... they questioned Nicky. 
 (V.O.) And when some guys who didn't pay their Shylocks began disappearing, Nicky's name was in every one of those newspapers. 
 (V.O.) Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses. 
 HOME - DAY 
. 
 (Ignoring the money) Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that? 
 Yeah, I heard, yeah. 
 Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it. 
 I know. 
 It's in all the papers. 
 What're you gonna do? 
 And I mean... that's no good. 
 I know. 
 You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better. 
 I'll tell him, Remo. 
 Yeah, but they're complaining. 
 It's up to you. 
 (V.O.) The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care. 
 (V.O.) I got my job... 
 (V.O.) ...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf. 
 (V.O.) And at the... 
 (V.O.) ...worst possible time for me. 
 A record of the arrests... 
 (V.O.) I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance. 
 That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches. 
 (V.O.) I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go? 
 You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission. 
 Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing. 
 Well, this kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing. 
 Good. 
 All right, well, we'll move on to - 
 (O.S.) (As he looks at the plane) I wanted to hear something about... Kansas City. 
 (V.O.) The Feds were watchin' Nicky play golf for so long, they ran out of gas. Just what I needed. Right in front on the Control Board. 
 (V.O.) (putting his sunglasses back on) And, as if things weren't bad enough... 
 (V.O.) ...in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss. He ran that little grocery store in Kansas City where they brought the suitcases. 
 They're fightin' over those suitcases again. You know what that means, right? You know what that means, right? That means I gotta take another trip out to Vegas, and it's gonna cost me another couple of grand. 
 (V.O.) He ran it with his brother-in-law, but mostly what he did was complain, complain about his trips to Vegas, to his brother-in-law and to his mother, all the time. 
 They're not gonna make a fool out of me. I write it all down in this book, (holding up a notepad) every fuckin' nickel that goes down. Right here, receipts... 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER (Chastising her son) Hey! Oh! 
 Oh, sorry - 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER What's the matter with you? 
 Receipts and bills and... everything's here. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER Since when do you talk like that? 
 I'm sorry. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER There's a lot of people here. 
 Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER Again! 
 I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER That's enough. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (V.O.) And what happens next? 
 (V.O.) You can't believe it. I mean, who the hell would believe that the FBI had a wire in the place lookin' for some information about some old homicide about some guy who was whacked-out, God knows when, over God knows what? 
 Plus, what's to prevent him with the suitcases, that he can take what he wants?  Fuckin' Nance, he brings us back two suitcases from the Tangiers, and what about three or four? 
 We got nobody in the room to watch. That's the law. You know, we can't even go into the count room to watch our money? Could you believe this cowboy bullshit? 
 And sure he's got his people in there. But how do you know? They could all be in on it together, those miserable fucks. 
 I'll find out and, if it's Green himself, I'll bury that bastard. 
 (Over transmitter) I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes... 
 ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER All right, take it easy now, take it easy. 
 Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right. (Knocking down some bottles of olive oil.) Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER (Tapping the counter) I know, but that's enough. 
 You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me? 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER I know it, I know it. 
 I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER Take it easy, though. 
 All right, all right. But I - I - 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER You'll get a heart attack like that. 
 You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this. 
 (V.O.) And the damn... 
 (V.O.) ...thing is, they go and hear all this stuff about Las Vegas and the casinos and the suitcases, and that's it. 
 (O.S.) If I have to start handlin' things the way I... 
 (Over transmitter) ...did years ago, start kickin' ass, I - I'll do it, and I'll use the goddamn shovel!  I mean, I... 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER (Over transmitter) You are right. 
 (Over transmitter) ...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER (Over transmitter) You are right. What can I... 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER (On tape recorder) ...tell you. 
 (V.O.) Would you believe that such a thing could happen? 
 (On tape recorder) I'm in this to make money, not to lose money.  And... 
 (V.O.) Every FBI man across the country had their ears open now. 
 (On tape recorder) Because... 
 (On tape recorder) ...if you want somethin'... 
 (On tape recorder) ...done right, you gotta do it yourself. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER (On tape recorder) Then do it the way you want. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER (On tape recorder) What can I tell you? 
 (V.O.) I mean... 
 (V.O.) ...Piscano, this guy basically... 
 ...sunk the whole world. 
 PISCANO'S MOTHER (On tape recorder) That's the way people are. There are some that are good and some that are bad. 
 Mr Chairman and members of the Commission. Mr Rothstein is pleased to be here today. 
 (V.O.) And when the day finally came, I was ready. I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case. 
 ...evidence... and we have documents, one of which is a report by retired FBI agents, which completely absolves (holding up a large file folder) Mr Rothstein from any wrongdoing. I'd like this marked, please, Mr Chairman. 
 (Into microphone) Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue... 
 No, I want to have this marked, Mr. - 
 (Into microphone) ...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application. 
 Denying? 
 (Into microphone) Do I hear a motion seconded? 
 Mr. Chairman - 
 (Into microphone) Do I have a vote on the motion? 
 Mr. Chairman - 
 (Into microphone) The ayes have it. This hearing is adjourned. 
 (Getting up) You guys have to be kidding. 
 Adjourned! What do you mean, adjourned? 
 Mr. Chairman, please. 
 Mr. Chairman... 
 Senator, you promised me a hearing. 
 You won't allow me a hearing? You didn't even look at the FBI reports. 
 When you were my guest, Mr. Chairman, Senator, at the Tangiers Hotel, did you not promise me that I would have a fair hearing - 
 (Interrupting, into microphone) I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers. 
 You were never my guest?! 
 (Into microphone) That's right. 
 I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?! 
 (Into microphone) Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time. 
 Liar. 
 (Into microphone) Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point. 
 He's lying. 
 The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein. 
 Was I at that dinner? Just tell me - 
 You were wandering around. 
 Was I at that dinner? 
 You were wandering around. 
 Was I at that dinner? 
 You were wandering around. 
 Was I at that dinner? 
 You were in the m- You were in the building. 
 I was in the building! 
 You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?! (Pause, looks at 
.) Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much. (Pause.) Give me that much at least! 
 (Hesitates) Yes, you were. 
 Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a 
 (V.O.) Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor. (On television.) What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam 
 (Overlapping) ...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption. 
 (Overlapping) What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for? 
 (V.O.) (Overlapping) ...and hypocrisy. 
 (Into two reporters' microphones) Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so - 
 - you could put 'em on your expense account? 
 (V.O.) In a (on television) Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license (voice-over, overlapping) denial, Rothstein followed several... 
 (With several reporters, overlapping) Bullshit! Bullshit! 
 (V.O.) ...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave. 
 (To COMMISSIONERS standing in the hallway, speaking into a TV news microphone) We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me. 
 (V.O.) (Overlapping) Long suspected of running the Tangiers without... 
 (Overlapping) ...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me - 
 - unsubstantiated truths on me. And if you look at your own lives you'd all be in jail.

 (V.O.) (Overlapping) ...a gaming license, yesterday's hearing was to determine whether someone with Rothstein's checkered personal history was qualified to officially hold the top gaming post. 
 (V.O.) (from previous scene continued) Fuckin' hypocrites! 
 What the hell's he gonna do now? 
 I don't know (Sighs.) 
 What's he doin'? He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours. What's the matter with him, making all this mess? 
 Maybe he could run things with another job title. Wouldn't be the best, but, uh, what are we gonna do? 
 However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office. Say he's the janitor, I don't give a shit. But, please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet. 
 
 (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, the Tangiers Hotel proudly presents the all-new Sam Rothstein Show, Aces High. 
 (O.S.) Tonight, taped live from the all-new sportsbook, we present the premiere showing of Aces High. With the... 
 (Into microphone) ...Sasha Semenoff Orchestra... 
 ...and the Sam Rothstein Dancers. 
 Mr Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best football handicapper... 
 ...in American, a man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the new... 
 ...Entertainment Director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino: Mr Sam Rothstein. 
 (Seated at a desk a la Johnny Carson) Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show. We're very happy to have you here this evening. The young lady to my left is Trudy, who is a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris. 
 Our first guest this evening... is Frankie Avalon. 
 Keep an eye on him. 
 (O.S.) ...Well, I've got a large family. 
 (Into microphone) How many kids do you have? 
 (Into microphone) Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children. 
 (Into microphone) Eight children! (He encourages the audience to applaud.) 
 (Into microphone) No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please. 
 (Into microphone, to audience) That's amazing. 
 (Into microphone) There was nothing to it. (Chuckles) It was my pleasure. 
 (O.S.) (From next scene) Let's not take County Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously. 
 (Into microphone) I recently challenged him to a debate on this program and he declined. What are you worried about, Pat? You don't have to send me any questions. You can ask me anything you want. 
 (O.S.) (From next scene) What the hell is he doin' on television, anyway? 
 HOME - DAY 
 He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this? (Chuckles.) He's out of his fuckin' mind. 
 (O.S.) (From next scene) It's a pity in this... 
 (Into microphone) ...state that we have such hypocrisy. Some people can do whatever they want. Other people have to pay through the nose. 
 HOME - DAY 
 (O.S.) (From previous scene) But such is life. 
 Andy, go see him. Tell him maybe it's time he should quit. 
 VEGAS - NIGHT 
 First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year. 
 These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from - 
 Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake? 
 The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run! 
 Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that? 
 What do you propose? 
 I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad? 
 They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere. 
 All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. 
 I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out. 
 (Sighs) I can't do that. 
 (V.O.) Of course... 
 (Into telephone) You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis. 
 (V.O.) ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car. 
 (Into telephone) Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera? 
 (V.O.) Next morning bright and early, I get the call. 
 (Over telephone) One o'clock? 
 (Over telephone) Great. 
 (Into telephone) You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go? 
 (Into telephone) Well, you know... 
 (V.O.) But just getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy anymore. Even the codes didn't work. So, we figured out another act. 
 (V.O.) You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in... 
 (V.O.) ...on the stuff involving crimes. So on... 
 (V.O.) ...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes. 
 (Over telephone) Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow. 
 (Into telephone) Yeah. 
 (Into telephone) What - what, Caesar's? 
 (Into telephone) Why? 
 (Into telephone) Suzy Creamcheese has the exact... 
 (Over telephone) ...same outfit. 
 (Chuckles, over telephone) But I saw something... 
 (Into telephone) ...something very... cute. 
 
. 
 (O.S.) (Into a radio) Okay, he, uh, he's out. It's the ant, uh, Brown unit. And he's with, uh, bogie. I think it's Frankie. 
 (V.O.) Nicky started out before me because it wasn't that easy... 
 INTO A RADIO. 
 (V.O.) ...for him to get around anymore. 
 (Into radio) Okay, pulled out... 
 (O.S.) (Into radio) ...pretty fast. He's headed upstream. 
 (V.O.) Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing... 
 (V.O.) ...cars at least six times before he could shake all his tails. 
 (V.O.) And because of all the planes, he had to use underground garages. 
 (V.O.) Meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous. 
 (V.O.) Normally, my prospects of comin' back alive from a meeting with Nicky were ninety-nine out of a hundred. But this time, when I heard him say, 'A couple a hundred yards down the road', I gave myself fifty-fifty. 
 What people? 
 I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick. 
 I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem. 
 Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass. 
 I - 
 What are you - 
 I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on. 
 Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right. 
 Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you. 
 No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told... 
 ...you? Do you remember what I told you? 
 (Interrupting) You never - ? 
 Well, we got company. 
 Yeah. Fuck him. 
 To Abraham Lincoln. 
 L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life'] 
 Here we go. Good luck. 
 Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you. 
 Mm. 
 They're havin' a good time too. 
 (Into telephone) Yeah? 
 (Quietly into telephone) Sam, we got a problem. 
 (Into telephone) What is it? 
 (Over telephone) The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we... 
 (Into telephone) ...all turned our heads and made out like we didn't know who he was. He's over at the twenty-one table with his... 
 ...nose wide open. He took the money out of his own kick. His nose is open for about ten thousand. 
 (O.S.) Now, he's really pissed. 
 (Into telephone) Oh, no. 
 (Into telephone) He wants a fifty-thousand marker. 
 (Into telephone) No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down. 
 (To NICKY) He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted. 
 ...give you ten thousand - 
 Look, take - 
) Yeah. Give yourself a hand right across your fuckin' mouth. 
 (To NICKY) He's here. 
 What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here! 
 Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both. 
 I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you. 
 Ten and that's it. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 I know, but everything's changed now. You're talking about a divorce. You're even asking for alimony payments and... child support... and now custody. 
 I just want what any divorced woman would get. 
 I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be? (To GINGER.) Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me. (To OSCAR.) Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I - 
 (To ACE) We had a deal. Remember that? (To OSCAR.) He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave. 
 (To GINGER, leaning closer to her) Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes. 
 You know me. Do you see anything in these eyes that makes you think I would ever let someone in your condition take my child away from me? (Pause.) Do you?  You know that won't happen. 
 (V.O.) And after all this time... and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted... 
 
 (V.O.) ...I could never reach her. I could never make her love me. I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life, a home and a kid. But that's not what happened. It just didn't work out that way. 
 (To the showgirls) Everything all right? 
 I mean, what could we do? After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other. You know, little separations. At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly Hills. She was gonna spend a week or so shopping. 
 (Over telephone) Yes, Mr Rothstein. 
 (Into telephone) Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, please. 
 (O.S.) Hello, Beverly Hotel. 
 (O.S.) Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please. 
 (O.S.) I'm sorry.  Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein have checked out already. 
 Hey. 
 (Into telephone) M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein? 
 (To AMY) Hey, little Dale Evans. 
 (O.S.) Yes, they both checked out. 
 (Into telephone) Thank you. (He hangs up.) 
 (Into telephone) Hello. 
 (Over telephone) Yeah. 
 (Into telephone, sighs) Uh, my wife is w-with an old friend of her i-in LA. 
 HOME - DAY 
 (Over telephone) Some low-life. A guy named Lester Diamond. 
 (Into telephone) My daughter's with 'em too and I think they're gonna try and kidnap her. Is there anybody you can send? 
 HOME - DAY 
 (Into telephone) We'll take care of it. 
 (Into telephone) Hello. 
 (Over telephone) Hello. 
 (Into telephone) Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam... 
 ...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone. 
 (Into telephone) She's not here, Sam. 
 (Over telephone) Lester... 
 (Into telephone) ...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately. 
 (Over telephone) I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me. 
 (Into telephone) Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't... 
 ...wouldn't do it. Yeah, no, I, I... 
 (Whispering to AMY) You shouldn't do this. 
 (Over telephone) You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone. 
 (Into telephone) Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay? 
 (Over telephone) So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes? 
 (Over telephone) 702 472 1862. 
 Mm-hm. (Pretending to write it down.) 1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b- 
 (Over telephone) Right away. 
 (Into telephone) I'll call you right back. 
 (Over telephone) Right back. 
 (Into telephone) You got it. (He hangs up; then to himself as he walks through a doorway to the living-room) Schmuck. (To GINGER.) All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick? 
 Hm?  Okay, you got, what, two million dollars in that box? 
 Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about. (He points to AMY.) Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl- 
 (Interrupts) I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man. 
 We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay? 
 (To AMY) We'll go later. 
 (To AMY) We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk. (To GINGER.) You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back? 
 I don't want to go to Europe. 
 (To AMY) Shut your mouth! 
 You know where she gets this from! 
 You shut up. 
 No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face. 
 Don't give me any of your shit! (To GINGER.) Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going. 
 Lester - he called you here. 
 Right. 
 Here. 
 He was just on the phone. 
 (Sniffs) He called you right here. 
 I just talked to him. 
 (Sighs) So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now. 
 Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I - 
 (Interrupting and getting up) That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's - 
 (Interrupting) He's sittin' by the phone - 
 (Yelling) What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house! 
 (Gathering AMY, hysterical) Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go! 
 It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know. 
 (Hysterical) Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now? 
 You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now? 
 (Grabbing her purse and rushing AMY out) Go! Go! Get in the car! Go! 
 (Mimicking GINGER) 'Go! Go! Go!' 
 (Over telephone) No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me. 
 (Over telephone) Yeah, uh-huh... Okay. 
 (Into telephone) So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right? 
 (Into telephone) Bye. 
 Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car. 
 She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here. 
 You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive. 
 No, I'm gonna drive. 
 (Stopping GINGER) No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy - 
 (Yelling) You're driving me nuts! 
 Get in the passenger's side! And I'm sendin' this kid to Bolivia in a fuckin' box. 
 (Polite, careful, smoking a cigarette) Yeah. 
 And what'd she want? 
 Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy. 
 Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out. 
 Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want? 
 (Sighing) I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know... (Pause.) She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy. 
 She's driving me fuckin' crazy. 
 (Over telephone) Hello. 
 (Sighs, into telephone) Hi, it's me. (Chuckling.) Just who you wanted to talk to, right? 
 (Over telephone) Listen... 
 (Into telephone) ...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away... 
 (Over telephone) ...please. That's all I'm askin' you. 
 (Into telephone) Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself. 
 (Sighs, into telephone) What do you mean? 
 (Into telephone, holding back tears) What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me? 
 (Into telephone) Uh, (sighs) I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know. 
 (Over telephone) Right. 
 (Into telephone) I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up. 
 (Into telephone) What about the money? Uh, where's the box? 
 (Over telephone) I gotta tell ya... 
 (Into telephone) ...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money. 
 (Over telephone) What's it... 
 (Into telephone) ...under? 
 (Over telephone) Pretty serious. 
 (Over telephone) How serious? 
 It's, uh, it's under twenty-five. 
 (Over telephone) It's under... 
 (Into telephone) ...twenty-five thousand? 
 (Over telephone) Yeah. 
 (Into telephone) And... 
 (Over telephone) ...the rest of the two million is still there? 
 (Into telephone) Yeah, yeah, I got the rest. 
 (Into telephone) Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five. (Sighs.) That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't. 
 (Into telephone) Okay? 
 (Over telephone) All right... 
 (Into telephone) ...all right. Where are you? I'll send a plane for you right away. 
 (Waving brightly) Hi, Sam. 
 So, what'd ya do with it? 
 With what? 
 With the money. 
 He needed some clothes. 
 (Sighs) Twenty-five thousand for clothes. 
 He wanted a watch, too. 
 Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Mm-hm. 
 D' (O.S.) (From following scene) Mr. R... 
 D' ...good evening. Signora. 
 Gino. 
 D' This way. 
 (V.O.) (as they are led to their table) The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense. 
 (Seated across from GINGER at a booth) First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much. 
 I bought him a watch too. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand? 
 Yeah. 
 At the most, which is impossible for him. 
 Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand? 
 (Staring down at her plate, trying to restrain herself) Would you knock it off, Sam? 
 I'm just tryin' to figure it out. 
 There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out. 
 Yeah, but I've been told that before, 'We're workin' it out.' You think that you're home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me? 
 (Pause) So, counting the watch, let's say another four thousand for expenses over the weekend... of which you must have had a good time. I know he did.  That's for sure. I know that... fuckin' piece of shit had a good fuckin' time. On my money. You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway. 
 You're lookin' at me a certain way. You - you're teary-eyed, huh? You're upset. You're a good actress, you know that?  Good fuckin' actress. You can fuckin' get that pity out of people. I'm not a john, you understand?  You always thought I was, but I'm not. And I'm not a sucker. That fuckin' pimp cocksucker. He's lucky I didn't kill him last time. Lucky he's fuckin' livin'. And if you would've stayed with Amy... and you would've ran away... you would've been fuckin' dead. 
 Both of you. Dead. Dead. 
 (O.S.) (Whispering into telephone) I cannot do it anymore. I can't fuckin' live like this. It's not right. 
 (O.S.) What are you? Yes, of course - He doesn't come home at night.  What is the big fuckin' deal? I go - Yes, and I just - I can't fuckin' take it. Why should I fucking take it? That wasn't the deal. He acts like... like I'm the only one around here with a fuckin' past. He'll never let me live it down.  Well... well, I mean, I tried. What the fuck do you think I came back here for? No, I'm not! 
 (Whispering into telephone) I want to have him killed. Yes, I want him killed.  I've fuckin' had it. 
 (Into telephone) So, are you with me on this? 
 You want to get rid of me? Here I am. Go ahead, get rid of me (ACE grabs the phone.) Hello. 
 (Grunting) Yes! I fuckin' hate you! I can't take it anymore! 
 Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts! 
 You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now. 
 Get off of me! Stop it! 
 Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here. 
 I want you out of here! I want you out of here! 
 (Starting to get up) Let go of me! Let go of me! 
 Take your (kicking the bag) fuckin' bag and get out of here! 
 I'll go, but I want my money right now! 
 You'll get your money! Don't worry. 
 The arrangement is over! 
 (Tossing clothes) No kidding. NO KIDDING! 
 And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street. 
 I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch! 
 Love you?! 
 How could I love you?! How can I love you?! You treat me like I'm your fucking dog! 
 You're lower than a dog! 
 Fuck you! 
 (Shoving the bundles of cash in her face) Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch. (Stuffing the money in her bag.) Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want. 
 I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too! 
 Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there! 
 And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it. 
 I guarantee you, I will not stop you. 
 Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase! 
 You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here. 
 Fine. (Sniffs, walking back.) I'm takin' Amy. 
 (Stopping her) You're not takin' Amy. 
 I am. I'm wakin' her up right now. 
 You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here. 
 I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you! 
 Get out of here! 
 Send my lawyers a letter. (Slamming the door behind her.) God-fuckin'-damn you! 
 (O.S.) (Through the doors as ACE walks away) You're not getting away with this! You're not gonna fuck me out of my end! 
 Fucker! (Sobs.) 
 (V.O.) The funny thing was, that after all that... I didn't want her to go. She was the mother of my kid. I loved her. And later... I realized I didn't want to give her the money, because if I did... I knew I'd never see her again. 
 (Affectionately) Oh. Have a good day at school. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? Okay, angel. 
 (Clears throat.) From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times. 
. 
 (Gently) Now, here's a beeper. I want you to keep it on you. It's very light.  So I can call you whenever I have to. 
 (Pause.) Okay? 
 (Smoking a cigarette) Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just - 
 Nothin'. 
 I don't - (Sighs.) 
 Yeah? 
 Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out. 
 Okay. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Yeah. 'Cause, you know, (leaning her head back) He's never gonna give me my jewelry. 
 He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass. 
 He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me. 
 (Quietly) I didn't. (Chuckles.) I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back. 
 Exactly. 
 (Playing with his jacket) I did what you told me to. 
 'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do. 
 Sure did. 
 NICKY/GINGER (In unison) Changed. 
 (Whispering) No, he's not. 
 (Holding back tears) Exactly. (Sighs.) He hates me. 
 He hates my fuckin' guts. 
 (Crying) I'm not as tough as you think I am. 
 (Sobbing) I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do. 
 (Softly, through tears) I need some help. I do. I need some help. (Strokes his chest.) You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky. 
 (Whispering) I do. I need a new sponsor. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 (Whispering) Nicky, please... 
 (Sobbing) Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Yeah. Uh-huh - 
 #1 (O.S.) You see that? 
 #1 That's Ace's wife. 
 #1 Fantastic! 
 #1 This is great for the boss. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. You didn't answer your beeper. 
 I threw it away. 
 You threw it away? 
 (As she puts some items away) Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore. (Stopping suddenly.) Where's Amy? 
 I put her to bed. 
 Oh. (Walking away towards their bedroom.) I got your cigarettes. 
 Oscar wants you to call him. 
 So, who'd you go to lunch with? 
 With Jennifer. 
 And where'd you go? 
 To the Riviera. 
 (Pause) What'd you have? 
 I had a... salad. 
 What did Jennifer have? 
 (Turning to ACE) She had the same. 
 (Pause) Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line. 
 Why do you want to do that? 
 You know why I want to do it. Just do it. 
 Fine. (Walking out and down the hall.) Just gonna get the bowl for my thing. 
 Mm. 
 The line's busy. There's nobody there. 
 (Over telephone) Hello. 
 (Into telephone) Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam - 
 All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer. 
 (Hanging up) Who were you with? 
 (Quietly) I was with somebody. 
 I know you were with somebody. Who was it? (Pause.) I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be. (Sighs, then whispers:) I just hope it's not them. 
 (V.O.) (Quietly) I knew she fucked around. (Sighing.) You know... 
 (V.O.) ...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done. 
 What if he won't stop? 
 (V.O.) I mean, it could get us both killed. 
 I can back him off. 
 (V.O.) She was very convincing... 
 (V.O.) ...when she wanted to be. 
. 
 (V.O.) And... this... this is how she backed him off. 
 I know. You don't have to tell me that. What do you think, (chuckling) I'm stupid? 
 (V.O.) By this... 
 (V.O.) ...time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets, that every time Marino went back home, the... 
 (V.O.) ...packages got smaller and smaller. It got... 
 (V.O.) ...to the point when he walked into the place... he didn't know whether he was gonna be kissed or killed. 
 (O.S.) Frankie, I want to ask you something. 
 It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth. 
 Of course, Remo. 
 I want you to tell me the truth, mind you. 
 I always tell you the truth, Remo. 
 Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem. 
 (V.O.) What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed. 
 (V.O.) Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business. 
 (V.O.) So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too. 
 (To GAGGI) No. I ain't see anything like that. 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know? 
 Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky. 
 Hm. 
 I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay. 
 He's good. He's fine. 
 I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me. 
 No problem. 
 You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand? 
 I understand. 
 Okay. (Pause.) Frankie, you're a good boy. 
 Thanks, Remo. 
 (V.O.) By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom. I mean, Vegas really got to him. 
 (V.O.) The booze, the coke, the broads... I mean, he got sloppy.  He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore. 
 (To NICKY) You must have drunk too much. 
 (V.O.) I heard one night he had to belt a guy three times before he finally went down. 
 (V.O.) In the old days, Nicky would've decked him with one shot. 
 (V.O.) You add this into the mix... 
. 
 (V.O.) ...to all of us. And his crew followed him right over the edge. 
 (V.O.) They were all tuned up half the time on coke. I mean, they started doin'... 
 (V.O.) ...stupid things. 
 #1 Watch it, partner, watch it! 
 (V.O.) The worst was Blue. 
 (Belligerent) Hey, what do you guys want out of my life, huh? 
 #1 Police! Stay in the fuckin' car! 
 (V.O.) He never knew when to keep his fuckin' mouth shut. 
 #2 He has a gun! 
 #1 Drop your gun or I'll -! 
 Hey, fuck you! 
 #1 Drop the gun! 
 (V.O.) The cops shot him. They shot Blue... 
 (V.O.) ...because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun! 
 (V.O.) You know, they could have... 
 (V.O.) ...been right, but who knows? 
 #1 Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here. 
 #2 What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil. 
 #1 Pitch-black?! It - 
 #2 It looked like a fuckin' gun! 
 #1 You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you... 
 #2 Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry. 
 #1 ...fuckin' jerk-off. 
 (V.O.) And to make matters worse, to get even, Nicky's crew got stoned one night and they started shootin' up the cops' houses. 
 (V.O.) I mean, it got to the point where they couldn't even talk in the Gold Rush anymore because the Feds put a wire in the wall. 
 
 (V.O.) And even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths because... 
 LIP-READER (Lowering his binoculars) Jeez, he's coverin' up again. 
 (V.O.) ...the Feds brought in lip-readers. 
 (V.O.) Nicky found out about it from a teller who owed him money.  This guy worked... 
 He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. 
 He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. 
 I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up. 
 Nah. You would've heard somethin'. 
 I know. I know. 
 Yeah, but they keep askin' about it. 
 What? 
 Oh, he ain't nobody. 
 Angelo and Buster. 
 They'll do it. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about? 
 Don't know. 
 Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint. 
 (Getting up from the table) Be right back. I'll be right back. 
 Rudy, any calls for me, just give 'em to Mr Sherbert. I'll be right back. 
 Sure, Mr Rothstein. You'll be back...? 
 I'm going home for a few seconds. I'll be right back. 
 (Into telephone) He's on his way home. 
 (Over telephone) Yeah, he just left. 
 (Looking around the house) Hello? Hello! Ginger. 
 (Faintly, from her bedroom) Help, Daddy! 
 (Knocking, turning the doorknob) Amy! Amy, open the door! 
 (O.S.) (From her room) I can't! I'm tied! 
 Wh-wh - 
 Dad! 
 What happened? What happened? Who did this to you? 
 Mommy. 
 I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll - 
 (Panting) Oh, no, please, please. 
 (Bending down, kisses her) Okay, I'll be right back. 
 When did this happen, honey? 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave? 
 I don't know. 
 (Comforting AMY as she moans) Ohhh... 
 (Into telephone) Hello. 
 (Into telephone) Yeah, uh, who's this? 
 (Into telephone) Nick? 
 (Over telephone) No, I'm not okay. 
 (Into telephone) How'd you know I was here? 
 (Over telephone) Well... 
 (Into telephone) ...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is. 
 (Into telephone) She's there with you? (Getting angry.) She's there with you? 
 (Into telephone) I'll be right there. 
 Great! 
 I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch. 
 Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch. 
 (Stoned, smoking a cigarette) Hi, Sam. 
 (Quietly) I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are... 
 Oh... 
 ...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind? 
 It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there. 
 I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again, (pointing his finger at her) I'll f-, I'll f- 
 She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while. 
 I should have - 
 I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up. 
 Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. (Pounding his fist on the table.) Listen, you fuckin' cunt. 
 Oh, sh- 
 Listen to me. 
 Fuck you. 
 (Knocking her drink over) Let me tell you something. (Pointing.) Listen to me. 
 I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up. 
 You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch. 
 (Leaning in to him) Why don't you just let me go, Sam? 
 You fuckin' whore! 
 I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay? 
 You understand? What? Let you go? 
 I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go. 
 You want your jewelry? 
 I want you to let me go. 
 And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house... 
 Right now. Get up and - 
 Get - Get up! Get up! 
 I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you. 
 Get - get up! 
 I wouldn't do that... 
 Get up! Get going! (Pushing the table.) Get up! 
 I wouldn't - 
 Get the fu- (Shaking the table.) You threatening me? (Making a fist.) I'll fuckin' kill you in this place! (Pointing to her.) Get up and go home right now. 
 (Barking) I'm going. I'm going, you -! 
 Now you need approval from him to go home? 
 So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh? 
 (Disgusted) You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker. 
 Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! (Opening the door.) Fuck you! 
 (Into telephone) Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on. 
 (Over telephone) Who's this? 
 (Into telephone) Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away. 
 (Into telephone) Okay. Just take it easy. 
 (Over telephone) Right away. Okay? 
 (Into telephone) I-I'll do it. 
 (Into telephone) Okay. (He hangs up.) 
 (To VALET PARKER) Leave it where it is. 
 Where is he? Goddamn it! I want that Jew bastard killed! I have fuckin' had it! 
 Calm down, calm down. Shh! 
 There's no reason to hide my car. He already knows! (Walking up the stairs.) He threw it in my face! The second I get out of here, I - 
 Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no. 
 If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him? 
 (Interrupting) Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with. 
 What about my money? 
 Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole! 
 (O.S.) (From bottom of stairway) Whoa. Calm down. 
 (O.S.) Take it easy! 
 You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy. 
 (Sobbing, getting up) I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money! 
 I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore! 
 You fucked with me for the last time! 
 Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right? 
 (V.O.) I already left the kid with neighbors and I had about a million in cash and jewels that I gave to Sherbert to lock up in the hotel. 
 (O.S.) (From following scene) Put this in the... 
 ...hotel safe, then I want you to come right back. 
 She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's. 
 (O.S.) (Screaming) You get down here! 
 (To SHERBERT as he walks around the bar with the gun) Just wait there for me! 
 (From driveway) Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker! 
 (From her car) I mean it! 
 You come down here right now! Come down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out here!  I'm gonna drive this fucking car through the living-room! 
 (Getting out of the car to confront ACE) You fucking coward! You motherfucker! 
 You come out here and talk to me, you fucker! 
 (From the porch) Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna - 
 I am not! 
 (Pointing to her) You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that. 
 Don't you threaten me! 
 You'll wake the whole neighborhood! 
 (Kicking the hedges) Don't you threaten me! 
 (O.S.) You are not threatening me anymore! 
 (O.S.) I'm not - 
 You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you! 
 I am fuckin' Nicky Santoro! I am! He's my new sponsor! 
 (To ACE) What about that, you fuckhead?! (To neighbors.) What are you looking at? Fuck off! 
 #1 Hey! 
 #2 Hey! 
 (To neighbors) Go back inside! This is none of your business! (To ACE.) I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore. 
 #1 Hey. 
 I'll to the FBI! 
 #2 Mrs. Rothstein, hey. 
 I will go to the police! I am not (kicking hedge) Protecting you anymore, you fuck! 
 #1 Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh! 
 He won't... 
 (O.S.) ...let me inside! 
 (O.S.) He won't let me in my own house! 
 #1 Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise. 
 I'm just trying to get in my house! 
 #1 I understand. 
 He won't let me go in my house! 
 I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm - 
 Not gonna let me in? 
 Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you - 
 What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal! 
 #1 All right. Okay, okay. 
 #2 Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway. 
 I'm afraid to let her in the house. 
 Oh, you are... 
 I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff. 
 (Kicking, pulling up plants and throwing them at ACE) Let me in the house! Fucker! 
 Fucker! 
 #1 Please. 
 Should I let her in like - ? 
 You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me! 
 #1 Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house. 
 #2 If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair. 
 If she calms down, I will let her in the house. 
 (Pants, yelling) I am calm! 
 If she calms down... 
 #1 (To GINGER) No, you're not calm. 
 ...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I - 
 (To COP #1) Can I go in? 
 #1 That's not a problem, that's not a p- 
 Can I go in? 
 #1 Jeff, would you go in with her? 
 #2 We can do that. Absolutely. Yes. Absolutely. 
 Yes, fine!  Fine! (In ACE's face as she brushes past him.) Fuck you! 
 (O.S.) (From following scene) You wouldn't believe how mean he's been to me. He's locked up... 
 ...most of my important stuff, all my papers and things. And I have to get 'em. 
 So don't let him come in here 'cause I know they're in here in the desk and he's - 
 Fuck! (Going through a couple of drawers.) Just pay attention. He could come up here at any time. (Pants.) 
 (Then, to COP #2) Are you watching for him? 
 Got 'em. 
 (Smoking, checking his watch) Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes. 
 #1 No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this? 
 Fine, fine. How's your family? 
 #1 Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again. 
 Oh, good. 
 #1 Yeah. 
 Congratulations. 
 #1 Thanks, yeah... I'm kind of happy about this, you know. 
 (Kneeling, to COP #2) I just have to get this one more thing and then we'll be - We can go. (She picks up an empty shoe box.) Shit! (Gets up, picking up a pair of ACE's shoes and tossing them on the floor.) God, fuck! Shit! God! (She runs out, taking a fur coat off a hangar. Then, grunting) Really pisses me off... (To COP #2.) Don't worry about it. 
 (To the COPS but looking at ACE) And it would be great if you guys could follow me out of here, because he's been threatening me. 
 #2 (To #1) Come on. I'm sorry. 
 #1 Okay. 
 (to COP #1, shaking hands) Okay, Randy. Thank you. 
 #1 All right, take care. 
. 
 (To herself, panting) I can't believe this. (Sighs.) 
 (To COPS, rushing inside) I just need to pick up a little cash inside.  Could you come with me? 
 (Into telephone, throwing the scissors into the open drawer) Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her! 
 (Over telephone) I-I'm sorry, Sam. 
 (Into telephone) You've got to stop her. 
 (Over telephone) What can I do? 
 (Into telephone) She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders- 
 (Over telephone) She has... 
 (Into telephone) ...the keys, and it's still in both your names. 
 (Carrying the box, slipping but catching herself) Whoa. 
 (Into telephone) I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. I'd like to help... 
 (Over telephone) ...but I can't. 
 (Into telephone) Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff. 
 (Over telephone) No, Ace. 
 (Into telephone) Half of everything is mine. 
 (Over telephone) Ace, listen to me. 
 (Into telephone) Half - I'm comin' down. (He hangs up.) 
 Shit! Oh, goddamn it! 
 (Then, to COPS who are watching) Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay? 
 #1 (To #2) Go get a bag, man. 
 (Looking up, offering COP #1 some cash) And here. Here. 
 #1 Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca- 
 No, you can, you can. (Sobbing.) You've been so nice to me. 
 #1 (Taking the money) I can't. 
 #2 (To GINGER) Like this? 
 (Struggling with two handfuls of cash) Yeah, just hold the top open, all right, and I can - 
 Oh, God. It's him. (To COPS.) You have to stop him. You have to - 'Cause he said he was going to kill me. 
 You just - Just stop him. 
 #1 Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' - 
 Stop - 
 #1 Wait, hold on a second. 
 Hey! 
 #1 Hold on a second. 
 #1 Nothin' we can do about it. Nothin' we can do. There's nothin' we can do. 
 Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing. 
 #1 Speeding? 
 #2 We're talkin' to you right now. 
 #2 There's nothing we can do. She had the key. 
 #1 She's on the account. There's nothing we can do. 
 #1 Let's pull her over at that Citgo Station. 
 #2 (Driving) Okay, let's do it. 
 #2 We're - we're placing you under arrest for - 
 (Sobbing) For what? 
 #2 We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting - 
 (Through tears) What? 
 #2 We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a - 
 (Crying) But I'm just trying to leave. 
 (V.O.) After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway. 
 (Sobbing) But it was just mine. 
 (V.O.) They had all the pieces they needed. 
 #1 Come on. 
 But I didn't do anything. 
 (V.O.) And everybody... 
 (V.O.) ...began to tumble. 
 #3 FBI! We have a warrant! 
 (V.O.) ...one after the other... just like dominoes. Between Piscano complaining on a wire. 
 (V.O.) Between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license... paradise... we managed to really fuck it all up. 
 (O.S.) (Into telephone) Yeah, well, someone's at the fuckin' door now. 
 #4 FBI. We have a federal search warrant. 
 #4 (To JENNIFER, showing his badge) My name is Marc Caspar, Special Agent, 
. 
 (Defensive) Yeah, well, (grabbing the phone and walking away) Can I make a fuckin' phone call? 
 #4 (Blocking her way as she tries to get by him) Hey, ho-hold it for a minute. You can make a phone call, but you don't have to talk to us like that. 
 (Slamming the phone down on a table) Hey - 
 #5 FBI! Don't be alarmed. 
 #5 This area is seized. 
 Grab everything in sight. 
 #6 Right. 
 (Walking through a door into the cage) Get the master account list! 
 I want all those papers seized, regardless of what they are. 
 I want this area off-limits to everybody. 
 (Holding the book) Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey. 
 (V.O.) Green? 
 (V.O.) Don't even ask. 
 #8 Thirty thousand dollars... 
 #9 Oh, this is good. Bingo! 
 #9 (Crossing the room to 
) Look at this! That you so much, Mr Piscano. How considerate of you. Appreciate it. 
 Those are my m- those are my mother's books. 
 #10 You're under arrest. 
 What are you guys doin'?! 
 #10 Take it easy, Artie. We just want to talk to you. 
 PISCANO'S WIFE (Screaming) Artie, are you okay? Sweetheart? Honey? Wait a minute! He's sick! Artie! Oh, God! 
 #10 (To PISCANO's wife) Move back! Come on! 
 #9 Dave! 
 PISCANO'S WIFE He's sick! It's his heart! 
 #9 CPR! Now! 
 PISCANO'S WIFE Oh, God, is he breathing? He's not breathing! 
 (V.O.) Poor Artie. He got so upset he had a heart attack and dropped dead right there in front of his wife. 
 PISCANO'S WIFE Artie! 
 #10 Calm down! Calm down! 
 PISCANO'S WIFE No, I won't calm down! He's my husband! 
 #10 Stay out of the way! 
 PISCANO'S WIFE Artie! Artie! 
 #10 We can't help him if - 
 (V.O.) (Quietly) And at the end of the day, they finally came to see me with the pictures. 
 #1 (Pointing to the pictures) Why protect a friend who betrayed you like that? 
 (V.O.) But I didn't want to look at 'em. I didn't want to look at the guys who brought 'em either. 
 Your Honor, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm. Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk. They are no danger to the community and they pose no flight risk. 
 And Pre-trial Services recommends that bail remain as presently set. 
 (Calling a recess) We're going to take a ten-minute recess. 
 (Putting down his oxygen mask once the door behind him is shut) He won't talk. Stone is a good kid. Stand-up guy, just like his old man. That's the way I see it. 
 I agree. He's solid. A fuckin' Marine. 
 (Holding his oxygen mask) He's okay. He always was. Remo, what do you think? 
 (Pause) Look... why take a chance? At least, that's the way I feel about it. 
 You call Artie... and you tell him I don't care what, he's gotta be in my office Thursday morning before eleven o'clock. 
 It's done. 
 (O.S.) It's done. 
 (To himself) It's terribly important. I gotta have a conversation with this guy. That's all. 
 (O.S.) (Gasping) Oh! Oh, no!  No... 
 (V.O.) After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody. She found some pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers in LA. And in a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels. 
 (V.O.) After they found her body... I had a private doctor do another autopsy. He said they gave her... a hot dose. In the end... all she had left was thirty-six hundred in mint-condition coins. 
 (V.O.) No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing... 
 (V.O.) ...it was amateur night, and you could tell. Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life. 
 (V.O.) The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse. 
 (O.S.) Hey, Nicky. 
 (V.O.) And so did the power that be. 
 How you doin'? 
 Huh? Come on, you fuckin' rat. 
 Fuck!  You... 
 (To MARINO) ...rat motherfucker! You rat mother- 
 Tough guy! You and your f- (he strikes DOMINICK's chest) Fuckin' brother! 
 Oh, you - ! 
 No more! 
 Get him, Marino! 
 (Hitting DOMINICK across the neck) You fuckin' scumbag! 
 (Lunging the bat into DOMINICK's stomach) No more. 
 (Looking at NICKY as he strikes DOMINICK) No more! You see? Watch! 
 Fuck you, you motherfuck! 
 No more fuckin' dirty work! 
 (To HARDY and BEEPER) Take him out! Take this motherfucker out! 
 All right. Strip him. 
 Come on, come on. Bury 'em. 
 (V.O.) The word was out. The bosses had had enough of Nicky. They had enough. How much were they gonna take? So, they made an example of him and his brother. They buried them while they were still breathing. 
 #1 Mister, you all right? 
 #2 Watch out, the -! 
 #2 Mister, you all right? 
 (Dazed) Yeah. 
 (V.O.) They had other ideas for me. 
 (As ACE is wheeled into the rear of the ambulance) You sure are lucky, mister. 
 (V.O.) The town will never be the same. After the... 
 (V.O.) ...Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over. Today it looks like... 
 (V.O.) ...Disneyland. 
 (V.O.) And while the kids play cardboard pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money... 
 (V.O.) ...on the poker slots. 
 (V.O.) In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played. Today, it's like checkin' into an airport. And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday. 
 (V.O.) Today, it's all gone. You get a whale show up with four million in a...

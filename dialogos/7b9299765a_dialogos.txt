 (O.S.) And they're off! 
 Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry. 
 Why? What's wrong? 
 (personal emotion mixed in) You are a valued customer, as you know. 
 But what's wrong? 
 I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see. 
 What is? 
 (holding up bracelet) This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry. 
 But they must be! They cut glass! 
 (wry) Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased? 
 It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all? 
 (warm, encouraging) Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars. 
 All right. 
 (rising) I'll get you a check. 
 I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry. 
 It's not your fault. 
 You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in... 
 I have only one thing now. Are you interested? 
 Well, I'd have to see it, of course. 
 You are seeing it. You're looking right at it. 
 I see. 
 You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A bracelet like that very rarely happens. A fine setting and workmanship usually mean precious stones. It always hurts me when I find they're not. I always hope -- (faint sad friendly smile) -- I'm mistaken. 
 Thank you. For everything you felt you could do. 
 Sir? Everything all right? 
 Getting better. A bad shrimp, I think. 
 Want us to take you to a doctor? 
 No no, I'm fine now, thanks, anyway. Still got a lot of clients to see. 
 Take it easy, now. 
 Oh, I will. 
 Put it this way, now. Say I rent to a woman, well, she has to have a room with a bath. I insist on it, because otherwise she's got the hall bath tied up all the time, washing her goddamn hair and her clothes and everything she can think of. 
 Now, your minimum for a room with bath is three hundred a month, just for a place to sleep and no cooking allowed. And just how many of these tootsies make that kind of money and have to eat in restaurants and buy clothes and -- 
 Mr. Simms. 
 (fawning) Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at-- 
 (uninterested) Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by. 
 I'll send her right up. 
 I had my first hotel thirty-seven years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas, and that's where I began to learn about women. They just don't make the money, you see, not regular they don't, and there's only one way they can get it. 
 Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's the fine type of person I have in mind for here. Like yourself, I have no doubt. He's a salesman, regular as clockwork, has a suite here. Fine man. Now, about these women. At first, you know, they just go out and do it now and then, just enough to make ends meet. But pretty soon they got that bank open twenty-four hours a day, and then you've got trouble. Hookers and hotellin' just don't mix. You'd think the cops'd be too busy catching real criminals, not snooping around after working girls, but that's the way the gravy stains, as the saying is, and I don't fight it. An ounce of prevention is my motto. 
 Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up there, he's expecting you. 
 If you keep out the women in the first place, see, you keep out the hookers, and then you keep out the cops, and that's how you have a clean place. 
 (O.S.) Roy? 
 Your medicine is here. 
 (amused by clothing) Well, well. In a real hurry, are we? 
 Always, for you, baby. 
 You aren't taking me for granted, are you? 
 Taking you for granite? 
 That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all. 
 (playing along) Are you sure? 
 (pulling her close) Let's find out. 
 Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar. 
 Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo. 
 Take two, three days. Call when you get there. 
 Roy? 
 Mm? 
 Look at me. 
 Oh, I am, baby, believe me. 
 Roy? It this all we have? 
 All? It ain't bad. 
 No more than this? 
 What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage? 
 I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material. 
 What's that? 
 Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game? 
 (laughing) No, baby. Come to Mama. 
 Wore you out, did I? It's a good woman you can't keep down, baby. 
 Have a good sleep, baby. Call you tomorrow. 
 Wait'll next year. 
 Damn that guy. 
 Smack. 
 Heads. 
 Heads. 
 Tails. 
 Tails. 
 (whispered) How much can I bet? 
 That's between you two. I got nothing at stake here, I'm just dealing. 
 What if we both guess wrong? You aren't gonna take... 
 We got him now! Put down that big bill you got. 
 (whispered) The fifty or the hundred? 
 The hundred! Hurry! 
 (doubtful) The ace is what I want? 
 Sure it is! 
 Is that okay? 
 You're damn right that's okay. 
 (picks up the cards) Whoever finds the ace, wins. 
 (whispered) Dark in here. 
 Too dark. I just can't see. 
 Let me borrow these, will you? 
 Now, that's better. 
 I didn't teach you that. 
 (whispered) You taught me a lot. Then I invented. 
 Let me see how you did that one. 
 Scram. Go home. 
 I can't. I just left home. 
 You're too young. You should be in school. 
 I am in school. 
 Where's the five? 
 In your other hand. 
 Myra? 
 Lilly? 
 Go away, Lilly. Go away. 
 (lugubrious) The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do. 
 Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside. 
 His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital. 
 Yes, yes, but that's -- 
. 
 (handing key) Your kid's in the back here. He's crying. 
 (sympathetic to Roy) The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different. 
 Roy, your mother's here. 
 They twisted my arm. 
 They knocked out my tooth! 
 You always say that! 
 (there's no food) Hah. 
 (O.S.) No, really, you're Roy's mother? That's impossible! 
 (O.S.) I'm Roy's friend. 
 Oh, of course, now that I see you in the light, you're plenty old enough to be Roy's mother. 
 (very weak, but amused) Play nice. Don't fight. 
 Darling! 
 Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years? 
 (cold) Nice to see you. (turns to Myra) What am I doing in here? 
 You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had? 
 You called the doctor, huh? 
 (reluctant) Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you. 
 (tossing It away) Oh, yeah? (very casual, to Lilly) Thanks. (back to Myra) How long do they say I'm in here? 
 Roy... Your mom saved your life. 
 Yeah? Only one life? 
 I was kind of... inconvenient... for Lilly. 
 (reluctant, but it's necessary) Thanks, uh, Lilly. 
 I guess I owe you my life. 
 "Down to the track?" 
 Her job. 
 (bright smile) I want to know everything about you. 
 (easy grin) You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts. 
 (angry, but defensive) You heard the shower, didn't you? 
 I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent. 
 Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more -- 
 It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money. 
 Joe, you know you'll -- 
 Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink? 
 My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting. 
 I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten? 
 (trying to be determined) This time... 
 We'll work something out, Joe. 
 I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me. 
 I just do what the doctor says, babe. 
 You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you. 
 (truly astonished) Mama! 
 Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you. 
 (insulted) I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that. 
 I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks. 
 That's just Lilly's way. 
 And you never defend me. You're afraid of her. 
 Oh, don't be stupid. 
 You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth. 
 Are you kid --? I hadn't even seen her in seven years! 
 (surly) They might as well. 
 Get well soon. 
 (easy) Every day in every way. 
 I'll see you when you get home. 
 What happened to your hand? 
 I can take care of my own bills, Lilly. 
 What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what? 
 (spreads hands; it's obvious) It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself. 
 I like those. 
 (defensive) You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob. 
 How come? 
 Not as tough as you, huh? 
 Up to you. 
 Sure. 
 Bluebell came in? 
 Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit? 
 You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando. 
 Bluebell. 
 How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that? 
 You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me? 
 One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth? 
 Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off! 
 You wanna talk to me straight up? 
 Your what? 
 What the fuck are you doin with a son? 
 (utter scorn) Motherhood. 
 You expect me to buy this? 
 I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this. 
 It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it. 
 You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes? 
 (doesn't matter) I'll loan you a raincoat. 
 (to the thugs) Take a walk. 
 BOBO (CONT'D) Get me a bath towel. 
 BOBO (CONT'D) You ever hear about the oranges? 
 Tell me about the oranges, Lilly. 
 BOBO (CONT'D) While you put those in the towel. 
 And if you do it wrong? 
 (impatient) What's that, Lilly? 
 You'll never shit right again. 
 BOBO (CONT'D) (hard, impatient) Bring me the towel. 
 BOBO (CONT'D) Go clean yourself up. 
 BOBO (CONT'D) The raincoat's on the bed. 
 Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door. 
 You want a drink? 
 See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly. 
 On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much? 
 Not skimming a thing, Lilly? 
 (honest approval) That's right. Take a little, leave a little. 
 (this is his creed) You're a thousand percent right! 
 You know it, Lilly. 
 (delighted) Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing. 
 Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me. 
 Lucky? You call that lucky? 
 You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that! 
 I tripped over a chair. 
 Why? 
 (his back turned) That's right. 
  (V.O.) (filtered; little-girl flirtatious) Myra here. Sorry you missed me. Tell me how to reach you and I will, just as soon as I can. 
 Babe, I'm gettin out of here, and that's it. Let's take some time out this weekend, go down to LaJolla, hit the beach, have some fun. Forget all this other stuff, huh? 
 Your difference between your folded towel and your clean towel is a trip to the laundry. When you're cleaning those bathrooms, what you do, you pick up the towel, you give it a good shake and a good look, and you say to yourself, 'Would I dry myself on this towel?' If the answer's yes, fold it. 
 What if it's wet? 
 Mr. Dillon! Welcome back! You look fine, just fine. 
 Thanks, Mr. Simms, I'm feeling fine. 
 (shy) I'm glad you're better. 
 You're well liked around here, Mr. Dillon. The entire staff will be pleased to see you're back. 
 Well, thank you. And thank them. 
 Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon. 
 That's true, Mr. Simms. 
 We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves. 
 Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush. 
 Happy to see you looking so good. 
 SIMMS (CONT'D) That fellow could be a congressman. (turns to maid) If it's wet, you don't fold it. You shake it, and hang it neatly on the rod provided. 
 Yes, sir. 
 (cheerful, confident) Whadaya say? 
 (uptight, minimal) Hello. 
 Roy! Welcome back. 
 (approaching him) What's going on? This is usually coffee break time. 
 Not since Kaggs showed up. 
 (happily basking) Hey, yeah, I'm fine, everything's great. What's this Kaggs? Sounds like a disease. 
 Troubleshooter from the main office. Came out here right after you went into the hospital, and he ain't had a kind word for anybody yet. 
 He chopped off half a dozen salesmen; won't wholesale to them any more. 
 (unworried) You think he'll chop me? 
 If he does, he's crazy. 
 Kaggs. Home office. 
 (taking his hand) Roy Dillon. 
 (keeping Roy's hand) I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon. 
 KAGGS (CONT'D) What's up? 
 That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman. 
 (brisk) You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you. 
 Lead on. 
 Take a seat. 
 When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally. 
 (dry) So I heard. 
 Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen? 
 Just myself. 
 That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think? 
 Sounds like a good Idea. 
 I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent. 
 What? Me? 
 That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say? 
 Well, uh... No. 
 (astonished) No? 
 I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody -- 
 I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week? 
 But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to -- 
 I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer. 
 (trapped) Well... 
 See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy? 
 (rising) Oh, sure. Fine. 
 And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid. 
 (distracted) Perk. 
 This really is it. Union Station. 
 I don't see why we have to take the train. 
 Because it's comfortable. 
 What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there? 
 We'll rent a car. 
 Big spender. 
 You ain't seen nothin. 
 Stretch my legs. Come along? 
 No. 
 (unruffled) See you soon. 
 Oh! Ow, I'm sorry! Oh, look, I spilled your drinks! 
 That's okay, don't worry about it. 
 2 You okay, pal? 
 Let me buy you a new round. 
 Hey, no, no problem. 
 3 You didn't like spill much at all. 
 What are those, bloody Marys? Watch this, I'll be back. 
 3 (to Soldier 2) Yeah, but it was you like told the sergeant your grandmother was dead. 
 (laughing) Again! 
 2 (to Soldier 3) And you jumped right in. (broad imitation) I'll drive him, Sarge, he's too distraught. 
 4 (astonished) Distraught? You said distraught? 
 Boy! You guys could've got in a lot of trouble. 
 3 Nah. Old Sarge, he's slowing down. 
 I don't know. I wouldn't take a chance like that. (looks at floor) What's that? 
 ROY (CONT'D) One of you fellows drop this? 
 2 You can't buy every round! 
 3 Like our turn! 
 Tell you what. We'll roll for it. Low number buys. 
 Go ahead. You roll for the four of you. 
 2 Here goes. 
 3 That's a four! 
 Told you I'd buy. 
 It just doesn't seem fair, Tom. 
 Tell you what. Give me a chance to get even when I come back. 
 Pretty woman like you shouldn't eat alone. Whadaya wanna eat alone for? 
 Right away. 
 We could have coffee together. My name's Kenny. 
 Let him find his own pretty woman. 
 This fellow bothering you, Ma'am? 
 (to the drunk) Why don't you go sit down? 
 I'll sit here. Move over. 
 You didn't have to do that. 
 (mumbled) Outta here. 
 It won't happen again, Ma'am, I promise. Dinner's on the house. More chili? Dessert? We have lovely pecan pie, my husband makes it himself. 
 You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more. 
 (purring) I'll sign that affidavit. 
 Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work. 
 You already went back to work. 
 (confused) What? 
 (indulgent smile) I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys. 
 (elaborate innocence) Working the what? 
 Oh, come on, Roy. 
 The tap. What you do for a living. 
 I'm a salesman. 
 You're on the grift. Same as me. 
 (demonstrating patience) Myra, I'm not following this. 
 (demonstrating exasperation) Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square. 
 You talk the lingo. What's your pitch? 
 The long end. Big con. 
 (shaking his head) Nobody does that single-o. 
 I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley. 
 I've heard the name. 
 It was beautiful. And getting better all the time. 
 (skeptical) Is that right? 
 (enthusiasm building) It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game. 
 (V.O.) All over the southwest, you've got these businessmen, they were making money when everybody was making money, they think that means they're smart. 
 (V.O.) And now they're hurting. Everything they had was because of oil. 
 (V.O.) They still got money, but they need more money, and that's just the kind of guy Cole and me like. 
 (V.O.) When the oil money was good, they put up all these office buildings, and now they're half empty. 
  (V.O.) They'll give you anything to move in; first two months free, redecoration, whatever you want. 
 (V.O.) They help you set up the store! 
 (V.O.) I'm the roper, I go out and find them and bring them in. Cole ran the store, and he was the best. 
 Mary Beth! As beautiful as ever. 
 (gentle disapproval) I see you brought a friend. 
 Mister Hebbing is my bodyguard, my strong right arm. Gloucester Hebbing, may I present my fine stockbroker, Henry Fellowes. 
 (to Myra; gentle warning) Mary Beth, what we have here, uh... 
 (gaily innocent) Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients! 
 (alarmed) Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely. 
 Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything. (to Hebbing; suggestive) Wouldn't I, darling? 
 Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money. 
 (innocent avarice) Goody! 
 Isn't that just beautiful? 
 Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing -- 
 (shocked) Mary Beth! This has never been anything but -- 
 Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has-- (to Hebbing) -- you don't mind my telling him, darling -- (to Cole) -- suffered reverses. If he could... 
 Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already... 
 (girlish laugh) So here we are! 
 (solemn) Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken. 
 (still serious) And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks. 
 Loose talk is the one thing I worry about. 
 Okay, then. Sit down, sit down. 
 The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing? 
 You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means? 
 Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in. 
 We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately. 
 These machines -- They're in here. 
 Want a look? 
 Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring. 
 Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer. 
 (O.S.) We're not really interested, Henry. 
 It's quite a sight. You sure? 
 Henry, don't try Mister Hebbing's patience. He knows what machines look like. 
 Well, if you're sure. 
 (V.O.) Cole liked to take risks, huh? 
 He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark. 
 And when he got serious? 
 He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker! 
 I thought these people were broke. 
 No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole. 
 And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run. 
 No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off. 
 Yeah? How? 
  (V.O.) Three or four days after Cole got the money, he'd phone the sucker, tell him he'd made the move. 
 (V.O.) Our buy was in the computer, we were rich, he should come collect. 
 Here you are! Two rich people! 
 You brought a case? Good. 
 Hold it right there! 
 (cool outrage) What? This is a private office! 
 FBI! Stock fraud, tampering with Exchange communications -- 
 Oh, my God! No! The scandal! 
 Your name? 
 (screams at Myra) You! You and your goddamn big mouth! 
 (terrified) Henry, no, I -- 
 Who did you tell? Who? 
 Just one or two of the girls, just, they wouldn't -- 
 Don't move! 
 Mister Fellowes, that isn't going to do you any good. Put that down, and -- 
 You ruined me! You destroyed me! 
 Henry, no! 
 Get back! Get back! 
 I'll kill the first one that follows me! 
 Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year. 
 What happened to Cole? 
 (suddenly evasive) He retired. 
 Where? 
 Upstate. 
 Upstate where? 
 Atascadero. 
 That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it? 
 No, baby. Not again. 
 It's hollow. You'll fall through. 
 Cole, it'll be all right. Honey? 
 (frightened but determined) Can't move. 
 It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation. 
 It's all hollow. Nothing behind it. 
 Cole, you scare me when this happens. One of these times... 
 Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon! 
 (heartbroken) Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you? 
 He retired, and that's it. But I didn't. I'm still the best long-con roper you'll ever see. 
 I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me. 
 (pushing enthusiasm) Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... (shrug) 
 Take a hike, you mean? 
 I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole. 
 (dubious) I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them. 
 Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand? 
 Think about it. Okay? 
 (easy to promise) Sure. 
 (coy, sexy) See you later. 
 I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through? 
 Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over. 
 (nevertheless grumpy) Things a man isn't supposed to know. 
 (soothing) You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out. 
 Sure. I'm pretty tired myself. 
 Long con. I'm the one's been conned. Who needs this? 
 Yeah? 
 (V.O.) (filtered) Open your door. 
 What? (grins; gets it) What for? 
 (V.O.) (filtered) Open it and find out. 
 MYRA (CONT'D) Gangway! 
 (coquettish) I hope you don't mind, sir. I just washed my clothes, and I couldn't do a thing with them. 
 You -- I don't know. 
 (sudden burst of laughter) ) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah! 
 Oh, come here. 
 (entering) Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend. 
 We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants. 
 Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough? 
 I pay my debts. 
 Expecting visitors? 
 You ought to put a bandage on that. 
 No. 
 I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh? 
 Well... nice to see you again, Lilly. 
 Here he comes. 
 I see him. 
 MYRA (CONT'D) Wait. Hold it. 
 That's the guy we're following. 
 Just wait. 
 MYRA (CONT'D) Ah. 
 MYRA (CONT'D) Now we follow her. 
 You're the boss. 
 You stay down real good. 
 One of my talents. 
 (pointing upward) Your mother's calling. 
 Naughty. 
 (O.S.) Roy! You drown in there? 
 Be right out! 
 You were gone for a while. 
 (casual) I went out to Delmar. 
 (suddenly wary) ) The track? Did you run into Lilly? 
 I saw her. 
 She didn't see you, in other words. 
 I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is. 
 (dry) You must have some very knowledgeable friends. 
 I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us. 
 Running your broker scam, you mean. 
 (enthusiastic) You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy. 
 Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard. 
 But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back? 
 Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out. 
 You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds. 
 (shrug) Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay? 
 Whatever you say, darling. 
 Yeah? 
 (V.O.) Roy Dillon, Mr. Kaggs. 
 Good! Send him in. 
 Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at -- 
 Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry. 
 (keen) You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy. 
 I guess I'm just not a leader of men. 
 Oh, come on, Roy. 
 The truth is, Mr. Kaggs -- 
 Perk, remember? 
 Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities... 
 A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about. 
 Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet. 
 (deep sigh) Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you. (forced laugh) Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too. 
 Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was. 
 That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough? 
 Fair enough. 
 Darling, guess what? I had to tell you right away. 
 (grinning) And hello to you, too. 
 I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position -- 
 Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners? 
 (bewildered) What? 
 The last I looked, we were just talking things over. 
 But the setup's there. It's there now. 
 I don't think I need it. 
 You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day. 
 Maybe I like it where I am. 
 Well, maybe I don't! I had ten good years with Cole, and I want them back! I gotta have a partner! I looked and I looked and believe me, brother, I kissed a lot of fucking frogs, and you're my prince! 
 Don't I get any say in this? 
 No! Because I -- 
 (pointing at her) That's what I say. 
 (thrown off course) What? 
 What I say is, no. We don't do partners. 
 MYRA (CONT'D) (raging) For Christ's sake, why not? 
 Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever. 
 Bullshit! 
 No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you. 
 What is it? What's going on? 
 I'm happy the way I am. 
 By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly. 
 (doesn't get it) ) What? 
 Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other. 
 What's that? 
 Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh? 
 You watch that mouth. 
 I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like -- 
 How do you like this? 
 
!! 
 That's not like me. I don't do violence. 
 That's why we wouldn't work together. You're disgusting. Your mind's so filthy, it's hard even to look at you. 
 Goodbye, Myra. 
 And you don't even know it. 
 Mama. It's Mama. She's the one. 
 You'll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes. 
 Lilly, I've got a couple things to think about. Well, kind of job offers, kind of. Different ways to go. I'd kind of like to talk them out, you know? Maybe just hear myself talk. 
 (kidding) Well, that's good news. 
 Well? Who's a boy gonna talk to, if not his mother? 
 Lilly, listen, it's Irv. You were always decent with me, I'm taking a hell of a chance here. Somebody blew you out with Bobo. The car full of money. He's -- Lilly? 
 Damn. 
 Somebody spooked her. 
 White Chrysler. 
 Full of cash. 
 (disgusted) Thanks a lot, Lilly. 
 Evening. Welcome to Phoenix. 
 Oh, everything's the same size, same price. 
 (sympathetic) Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean. 
 I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert. 
 Right in front of the room. 
 No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn. (confidential) It's his kidneys. 
 Something wrong? (embarrassed) I'm sorry. I thought you were the other lady. 
 No. I'm me. 
 I'll give you one oh seven. That's a very nice room, very handy, in the front, right by the pool. 
 Oh, don't you have something around back, where it's quieter? 
 Everybody wants the back tonight. 
 I guess everybody wants privacy. 
 Roy Dillon? 
 Yes? 
 Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here. 
 Thank you. 
 I realize this is a shock. 
 Well, mostly, I don't believe it. 
 That's natural. 
 No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out. 
 I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even. 
 Gun? 
 I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon. 
 It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide. 
 (interested) Do you have any particular reason to say that? 
 My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day. 
 (thoughtful) A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me. 
 Not that it matters. (looks out) This is the morgue? 
 You up to it now? 
 Sure. Let's get it over. 
 One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound... 
 (impatient) Yes, I know, I know. 
 (reluctant) Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun. 
 (not understanding) What? 
 I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here. 
 (low; getting it) Ate the gun. Oh. 
 Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock. 
 (opening the door) Well, let's get the shock over with. 
 Not many laughs in this room, eh? 
 Not many. 
 PIERSON (CONT'D) (to the attendant) Remove that. We'll want a full, uh, identification. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 No question, huh? 
 No, its -- Why did she--? 
  (O.S.) That's that, then. 
 (starting to grin) Oh, yeah. That's that. 
 ROY (CONT'D) (laughing quietly) Mom. 
 The last modern thing I liked was the miniskirt. Your technology, now, nobody understands it, and that's the simple fact of the situation. 
 (calling) ) Evening, Mizz Langley! 
 New things come in here all the time, how do they work? You can ask your Ph.Ds, your highly educated, intelligent, professional people, you can say to them, how does that work, and you know what they'll tell you? You plug it in. And that's the way the donut dunks. 
 (O.S.) Hello, Lilly. 
 Going somewhere? 
 I just came back from Phoenix. 
 Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it. 
 You're dead, Lilly, it worked. 
 Why should they? The cops are satisfied. 
 Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down. 
 Myra followed you, huh? 
 (isn't worth discussing) No. 
 I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it. 
 (cold grin) That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix? 
 This way's perfect. 
 You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though. 
 Don't be sorry. You're not taking it. 
 You must have some money. 
 And Myra's stuff? 
 Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over. 
 You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job. 
 Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you. 
 Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself. 
 I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now -- 
 I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you -- 
 I know you do, so that's why -- 
 No. 
 I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either. 
 Yeah, sure, that sounds nice. 
 You wouldn't do that. 
 (easy) Oh, you'll live, Lilly. 
 Oh? I didn't know anything was. 
 (full laugh) Not very good! 
 (closed against her) Uh-huh. 
 (not worth discussing) Never. 
 What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself. 
 For God's sake, Lilly! 
 (not worth discussing) No. 
 That's right. 
 (amused) I don't? 
 I don't see why not. 
 Well, uh... 
 Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out. 
 (full laugh) Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly. 
 Lilly. 
 If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it? 
 That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes... 
 (stonewalling) Just trying to help, Lilly. 
 (bewildered) What? 
 (hoarse) What's that all about? Of course you're my mother. Of course you are. 
 There's nothing more to talk about. 
 Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?

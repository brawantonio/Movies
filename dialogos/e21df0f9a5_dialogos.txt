 I received a formal request for marriage today for Anne. (a beat) From the Carey family. 
 But that's wonderful. 
 I turned it down. 
 And offered them Mary instead. 
 Fnne's too good for William Carey. She can do (better than a merchant's son. 
 You underestimate Mary. 
 Not true. I think she's..the kinder of the two. Quite possibly the fairer. 
 But to get ahead in this world, you need more than fair looks and a kind heart. 
 (applauding his favourite) Bravo! Anne! 
 May we come in..? 
 Look at you..! Younger than me. More beautiful than me. Married before me. (a beat) I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other Boleyn Girl.' 
 Hardly. 
 No, is this it? This is the end of the unholy trinity? 
 No, George. Never. I'll be married, that's all.. (a beat) Apart from that - it won't change a thing. 
 Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in nobis.. 
 Are you happy? 
 Very. 
 You don't secretly wish you'd married someone grander? With a title? 
 No. I want a husband who loves me. And who thinks it first thing every morning. And last thing at night. 
 Then you've found the right man. 
 Who is that? He was staring at me in church? 
 That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of Northumberland. Richest landowner in England. 
 But don't get your hopes up. He is already betrothed. 
 Betrothed is not married, brother George. A lot can happen before you reach the altar. 
 Thomas.. 
 I think I have managed to persuade the King to come and stay with you on progress. A week-end's hunting in late summer. 
 But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank you so much.. (he turns to ELIZABETH) Did you hear that, Elizabeth? 
 (hates the idea) Yes. 
 Finally we can present George, and with luck, get him a position at court. 
 These are difficult times. I have it on good authority that the Queen no longer bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir is still not resolved. a beat) It cannot be long before the King is forced to look outside the marriage. 
 What? And make a bastard King of England? 
 A legitimized bastard. What choice does he have? (a beat) Obviously, I've given it thought, and wondered which Howard girl I could put under his nose. Imagine the influence that would give us. To be blood family of the next King of England. Equally, imagine if another family were to achieve the same? 
 What about Anne? 
 I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not officially a `Howard', but as your sister's daughter.. 
 But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't you prefer her to have a nice, uncomplicated, respectable marriage? Like Mary? 
 If Anne were an uncomplicated, respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say `yes'. But she's not. 
 She's anything but. 
 don't like it. It would cost a fortune to make our house fit for a royal visit. Money we don't have. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 And what if you were to look on the bright side? Just once? 
 Risk nothing, you gain nothing. 
 hen was it that people stopped thinking of ambition as a sin, and started thinking of it as a virtue? 
 Easy for you to say. You've had power and wealth all your life. 
 Until I married you, Thomas. And I was happy to give it up. 
 You asked to see me father? 
 Yes. Come in. 
 o - the King himself is coming to Hever. I'm so happy for George. 
 Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems he has ambitions for me, too. (a beat) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 What? What are you saying..? 
 It's known the King has a wandering eye. Imagine...if he were to like me? 
 But...you could never be more than his mistress. And that's no substitute for a husband. 
 But as the King's mistress the least I'd get after he finished with me would be an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And gave him what his wife has failed to? a beat) Quite apart from the money, it'd be a Duke at least. 
 But what about your happiness? Your future? 
 I could be a happy Duchess. 
 Are you nervous? 
 A little. 
 You'll tell me everything in the morning? 
 I promise. 
 No details spared? 
 Hold me a moment? 
 I am the luckiest man in the world. 
 There he is! 
 You think he will like me? 
 Of course, sister. How could he not? 
 Your Majesty, you are most welcome. 
 Sir Thomas. kisses hand) Lady Elizabeth.. 
 May I present my son, George. 
 (while staring at MARY) Your Uncle tells me I should have you at court. Should I? 
 It would be a great honour, Sir. 
 And our daughter, Anne. 
 No one said anything of a daughter. 
 Had we known, we might have come sooner. 
 Your Majesty.. 
 Perhaps you'll allow Anne to show you around our modest house? 
 A pleasure. 
 Here is the library. 
 Charming. 
 And through here, the observatory.. 
 Lovely.. 
 What's that? 
 falcon, your Grace. 
 I can see that. But what's it doing there? More to the point.. (turns 360) ..not just there, but in every corner in the house? 
 I have no idea. Ask my father. a beat) Perhaps because falcons are vaguely associative with field sports - field sports with aristocracy - and in the absence of a genuine coat of arms.. (shrugs) ...a man with ambition will do the strangest things. 
 That's a sharp tongue you have. a beat) I wonder what it might say about me behind my back? 
 Oh, his Majesty has nothing to fear from me. Unless he fears an excess of compliments. 
 Really? And what would they be..? 
 Bravo, Anne! The King was quite smitten! Told me so himself. And has requested you sit beside him at dinner. 
 My girl. My dear, remarkable girl. I knew you would up to the task. 
 Well played! And, may I say.. (a modest smile) ..an excellent choice of music too! 
 Sir Thomas, Lady Elizabeth, dear Anne. Your health. H ENRY raises his glass. Cheers and applause from the COURTIERS. A beaming SIR THOMAS raises his glass. 
 ..I had it from the lips of the Spanish ambassador himself. That our musicians are the envy of all Europe. 
 ..then he was flattering you, your Grace. 
 Our Universities and philosophers, too. 
 ...another lie. That honour would have to go to the Germans. 
 What of our painters, then? 
 Years behind their Italian counterparts. The truth is far from leading the world, we're a provincial outpost, lagging far behind. 
 What? Is no one proud to be English? (turns to ANNE) Anne? What say you? 
 Me, my Lord? clears throat) I know little of such matters, but I've not heard mention of our armies. Undefeated, I believe, in a generation. 
 Well said. 
 Or our navy? The finest in the world. 
 It's true. 
 The universities in Spain and the philosophers in Germany may be strong, but are they really the equal of Oxford and Thomas More? 
 Never! 
 I doubt there is a country that is fairer in Government, or better protected by nature from her enemies, whose people are happier or more prosperous.. 
 She's right, by God! She's right! 
 You did well tonight. Very well. Quite enough to be invited to court, I am sure of it. 
 Now go to bed. Get a good night's sleep. Because there's still the hunt tomorrow. a beat) You must excel at that. 
 Good morning, Anne. 
 Good morning, your Grace. 
 ho will you be riding with? 
 On my own your Grace. 
 Your own..? 
 They have invented a new saddle which allows ladies to ride on their own. 
 ut with no man to hold onto? How will you stay on the horse? 
 Why? The same way you hold onto yours, your Grace. 
 We'll see. 
 Let's away! 
 (kicking his horse) Hah! 
 (kicking his horse) Hah..! 
 We've lost him. He's in the forest. 
 Then we must follow. 
 Hah! 
 he King of England defeated by a humble fawn. 
 (suddenly kicking horse) Hah! 
 Please, your Majesty. It's not safe. 
 It's a miracle, Majesty, you have no broken bones.. 
 My daughter Anne is here. Would like to apologise. 
 (recoils, his pride hurt) No! Get her away from me! 
 And who are you? 
 Mary, your Grace. Anne's younger sister. 
 You've been here all week-end? 
 Yes, your Grace. 
 Really? How could I have overlooked you? 
 Next to Anne, it's easy to do. 
 Nonsense. 
 Yes, your Grace. To William Carey. 
 From Wolsey's office? 
 Yes, your Grace. 
 Then why haven't I seen you at court? 
 Because I have persuaded him to spend a year or two here first. We have a small manor and some land. Nothing much. But enough to start a family. 
 A charmed life in the country? Away from it all? 
 Yes. 
 Everything I would have wished for myself. But then my brother died. a beat) And duty called. 
 You don't think he'll miss court? a beat) A young, ambitious man? 
 He says not, your Majesty. 
 But, if he ever changed his mind, I would always support him. 
 Well said. 
 Thank you again, Lady Elizabeth. We'll take good care of your boy.. (kissing her hand) And Thomas.. 
 You'll take care of that matter? 
 Consider it done, your Majesty. 
 Your Father wishes to see you. 
 Just Mary. 
 Mary, I don't know what you said or did - but you obviously made a deep impression on the King. exchanges a look with SIR 
) And he has requested you come to court with immediate effect. 
 What?!? 
 ou're to pack and leave first thing in the morning. 
 The King himself has secured you a position in the Queen's household. 
 ut I don't want to go to court. Nor does my husband. 
 ell her. 
 The King has also offered me a position. As Gentleman of the Privy Council. 
 What? 
 Y'hear that? Gentleman of the Privy Council! Attending to the private and personal needs of his Majesty himself! That's the inner sanctum! 
 But what about our future? Here in the country? 
 Put it out of your mind. From now on your home is at court. 
 William, please! Don't you understand what this means? 
 They will separate us. Put me in different accommodation. Where the King can always...find me. 
 Happily your husband understands the value of such an opportunity. (a beat) For us all. 
 What about Anne? Couldn't she go instead? 
 The way that girl behaved this week-end, she can count herself lucky she still has a home. 
 How could he DO this to me? My own father. a beat) What if we just refused? 
 We would be cut off. He made that clear. 
 But would that be so bad? 
 Position means nothing to me. Nor wealth. We could find somewhere. A small farm. Away from everything. 
 You say that now - but when you're older? And our children are grown up? (comforting her) This won't last long. A year. Maybe two. And at the end of that - we'll we have everything we want. (a beat) It's for our FUTURE. 
 ut can't you see? Do this, and we might not HAVE a future. 
 I'm so sorry.. 
 What for? You think I want the King? Or to be used and abused by him? (puts on brave smile) No! You're welcome to him. I have my own plans, which don't involve becoming a rag that will one day be discarded. 
 Mary Carey, Ma'am. 
 Who? 
 The new Lady in Waiting. 
 Really? But I was not expecting anyone. 
 Appointed by...his Majesty the King. 
 By my husband? Really? 
 Well, then she must be some kind of gift. He must have seen in her some special talent that would please me. Tell me. What special talent is it that you have? with icy contempt) Apart from your obvious youth and beauty? T errified, MARY stammers.. 
 I...I.. 
 oetry, perhaps? 
 N-no.. 
 Or dressmaking? 
 I..I.. 
 Music! That's it! You compose? Or sing? 
 ..I'm afraid not. Your Majesty. 
 Come, you're too modest. turns to a MUSICIAN) Signor Vasquez. 
 No..really..I beg you, your Majesty. 
 (barks, suddenly terrifying) I command you to SING!!! 
 Bravo! A nightingale! (the cruel satisfaction of victory) Welcome at court! 
 WOMAN'S VOICE ait! Mary! Stop! 
 I know that must have been agony, but put yourself in her shoes. She knows the only reason the King has asked you here is because he desires you. For a wife that must be very difficult. a beat) She's a good woman. Trust me. 
 Mary Carey. 
 You have a brother, don't you? George? 
 Yes. 
 I've seen him a few times at court. And like him...very well. (a beat) But I don't think he has noticed me. 
 I can't imagine. (a beat) Should I mention you to him? 
 Would you? 
 Of course. Happily. 
 Not noticed her? Jane Parker? Of course I have. How could I not? She looks like a goat. 
 Well, she likes you, and asked me to give you this..to remember her by. 
 Ugh. Well say you haven't seen me. Or that you forgot. 
 And our sister? Any word? 
 ANNE? You know she took being upstaged by you very badly. 
 Yes, I know. 
 And no amount of interventions on my behalf would make her believe you hadn't done it intentionally. 
 But you KNOW I would never do anything like that. 
 I know. 
 (O.S.) Please, don't be alarmed. 
 I wanted to find somewhere we could be alone so I might say a few words to you in person. 
 I hope your accommodation is comfortable. I realise it's no substitute for the life you had in mind in the country.. (a beat) But please, give me the opportunity to try to make you happy here.. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 (tailing off) What are you..? 
 I am sorry. (delicately putting her clothes back on MARY) You obviously misunderstand me. 
 What? If all the King wanted was coition, he could fetch in a woman from the bath house. a beat) What he wants is YOU. a beat) To woo you. And be wooed in return. (a beat) And could'nt you look just a little happier? There isn't a girl in the Kingdom that wouldn't wish to be in your shoes. 
 Your opinion, Uncle. 
 Mine is that it's the greatest insult of all. 
 What? 
 Asking a whore to have feelings, too. 
 Are you there? 
 No one saw you? 
 No. 
 You brought the money. 
 And the groom? Is he here? 
 Good. Then let us begin. 
 George? It's the middle of the night. 
 t's Anne. 
 hat? 
 he's married Henry Percy! 
 (horrified) What? 
 In secret. Without telling anyone! 
 Oh, no...! 
 tailing off) You don't look pleased. 
 Why would I be pleased? 
 It would make her the future Duchess of Northumberland. Our sister! 
 But they'll never allow it, don't you see? He's already precontracted to Mary Talbot, and if word of the consummation gets out her reputation will be ruined.. 
 ...I have to tell Father. Before it's too late.. 
 What? 
 Mary..! Wait! Come back! 
 What were you thinking? The marriage of a senior noble is a matter of state. Something only the King can decide.. 
 Who knows about this? 
 No one. 
 Then that is how it shall remain. Forever. 
 But you cannot undo what has been done before God. (defiant stare) And consummated too. 
 WHAT? 
 (struggling to contain his anger) There have been improper intimacies, too? 
 I have lain with my husband. There is nothing improper about it.. 
 SILENCE! My God, if you were my daughter I'd thrash you within an inch of your life.. 
 The boy will return to Northumberland - where he will marry the Talbot girl. As arranged. 
 As for you. You will go to France and stay there until you have learned your lesson. 
 What? 
 How could you do this to your sister? You know full well her friendship with the King is at an extremely delicate stage. Any scandal or black mark against Mary's name now could be fatal. 
 You will join the court of the French Queen. And stay there until your father has forgiven you. 
 ou told them, didn't you? a beat) How COULD you? 
 Because you would never have got away with it. And it would have ruined your prospects forever. (a beat) Believe me. I did it for your good. 
 Really? For MY good? I'll try to remind myself of that. While I'm in exile. And you're here, in the King's bed, and unchallenged for our father's affection. a beat) That it was for MY good. Not yours. 
 ANNE, wait..! 
 Why look so glum, Mary? 
 What reason have I to be happy? 
 ou have two men, the King of England and I, both fighting for your love. 
 Do I know you? 
 You know me, Mary - but not half as well as I know you. I know you better than anyone here. And love you better than anyone here, too. And if God had made ME your husband instead of William Carey, one thing I know.. (a beat) I would never have let you go. 
 Wait! Who ARE you? 
 #2 Ah! Who have we here?!? 
 My name is Kindness. 
 #2 wonder, will you be kind to me? 
 What is it you desire? 
 #2 our love, fair Lady. 
 You demand a great deal. 
 #2 No more than I would give in return. 
 It is easy for a man to declare love from behind a mask. 
 #2 ut if I remove it, you might reject me. 
 If your feelings were sincere, I would never reject you. 
 #2 But you do not know who I am? I could be ugly. Or poor. 
 o matter how you looked. Or who you were. 
 #2 Really? Then I shall hold you to your word. And unmask..! 
 Your Majesty..! 
 he faints! Quick! Take her to my rooms! Call my physicians..! 
 Go! Leave us! Go! 
 Thank you, your Grace. 
 `Henry', please. The first rule of this room, is to leave `Your Grace's' and `Your Majesty's' outside. 
 Is there anything I can bring you? 
 No. 
 Nothing to increase your comfort or well- being? 
 You might ask your servants to bring me some water. 
 There. There ARE no servants. 
 So, this is it? This is where the King of England sleeps? 
 And reads. And writes. And finds a few moments each day... (gestures) ...for himself. 
 I am. I suppose it's more.. 
 ..simple than I imagined. 
 There's no need for show. I am only ever here alone. 
 And yet you invite me here? 
 Because I trust you. 
 You hardly know me. 
 A man in my position develops an instinct. a beat) You would never lie, could never lie to me. 
 No. 
 I also sense...that you might relish an opportunity to be yourself, too. 
 Yes. 
 Well, here you only say what you like, do what you like. M 
 Very well. 
 I'd like an apple, please.. (can't believe she's saying this) ..Henry. 
 Now it's your turn. 
 What? 
 To say something, or do something you couldn't outside. 
 There are many things I cannot admit to in public. Sadness, for example. And loneliness. 
 But when you are loved as much as you are? How can you be lonely? 
 Do you not know what it is to be lonely in a marriage? 
 Yes. I do now. 
 married my brother's widow because my father ordered it. As a duty. To keep the alliance with Spain. And she is a remarkable woman. And wife. 
 But I never looked at her or longed for her the way I do you. 
 Imagine how different it might have been. For both of us..had we been able to chose for ourselves.. 
 Good morning. S jumps to his feet. Waking rapidly.. 
 I have orders to bring you to your father. 
 My father..? a beat) Well, we'd better not keep him waiting. 
 Well..? 
 Did he have you? 
 Yes. 
 More than once? 
 You'd better get used to talking about it. Once you sleep with the king, it's not a private matter any more. 
 Yes. More than once. 
 So he was satisfied? 
 I believe so, Uncle. 
 ood. This is where our work begins. It's one thing to catch the king. Quite another to keep him. 
 I want you to keep her spotless, hair washed every day. She must read all the latest books and be able to venture and defend an interesting opinion. She must know her music, must be energetic and entertaining - in company and in bed. That's how he likes his women. And if ever she's in any doubt as to how to conduct herself, or what to do next - she should simply watch the Queen. That woman kept him from straying for eleven years. And the effort almost killed her. 
 The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty- two guns and two hundred feet long, and with your permission Thomas.. (We notice SIR THOMAS's clothes have become more expensive, grander) ..I'd like to name her after your daughter. The "Mary Boleyn". 
 Majesty! I'm...I'm speechless.. 
 onsense. She's an angel. It's the least she deserves. And if there's anything else I can do for YOU, my friend..as an expression of my gratitude..let me know. 
 s it happens..there is one thing. 
 Name it. 
 ur son, George. He's of an age now.. 
 You want me to make him a match? 
 Yes, your Majesty. 
 Do you have anyone in mind? 
 There is one lady, Sir.. 
 Go on.. 
 Who I fear is too high-born for us. And following the unfortunate matter between Anne and Henry Percy, I didn't want my children to overreach themselves again.. 
 verreach themselves? 
 One is currently in the King's bed. If they are good enough for me, I suggest they're good enough for anyone else. So.. (gestures) Who is it? 
 (O.S.) Jane Parker..? 
 I beg you, Father. No. 
 She's well connected, her father is cousin to the King. And there's money, too. 
 But must I actually...marry her? 
 thought you had ambitions for this family.      G 
 I do. 
 And that you wish to make a contribution yourself. Not just stand back and watch your sisters. 
 Then my advice would be to start behaving like a man. A real man. Do I make myself clear? 
 (quiet) Yes, Sir. 
 For God's sake, it's the wedding of our youngest child attended by the King of England and the greatest Lords in the Land. Would a smile be too much to ask? 
 What's to smile about? I'm a mother with one child on his wedding day looking like he's been condemned to death. 
 Another banished abroad, in disgrace. And a third whoring in public with an adulterer. 
 For the moment she's happy. 
 But will she be happy when he leaves her? Because you know that's how it will end. 
 Only God knows how anything will end. 
 God..? He turned his back on all this a long time ago. 
 You're in love with him, aren't you? 
 illiam, you're drunk. 
 How is it? With him? 
 He pleases me. Is that what you want to hear? 
 What does he do to you? Tell me. I want to know.. 
 I know you look at me with contempt. But I had no choice. Your father insisted I stand aside. What was I expected to do? 
 Say `no', husband. (a beat) That was all you had to do. 
 Are you certain? 
 Yes. 
 n that case...I suppose...someone should tell the King. 
 (O.S.) Keep them shut...still shut.. 
 Now open! 
 There's more. Thanks to you, I am to become an Earl. Your brother a Viscount. 
) So our debts are paid off. 
 Just be aware. These `gifts', this `favour' can go as swiftly as it comes. These rooms belonged to the Duke of Buckingham. Once the King's closest friend. Now his head rots on a spike.. 
 Because he committed treason. 
 But what is `treason'? It's anything the King or his lawyers decide it to be. Anything that offends him, or causes him displeasure. a beat) And can you assure me we'll never do that? 
 Pay her no heed.. 
 Happily, the baby lives. She's not miscarried. S SIR THOMAS's face. Overcome with relief.. 
 But the placenta is weak. For the sake of the child.. 
 She must begin her lying-in immediately. 
 (horrified) What? 
 But I'm only three months.. 
 ou poor girl. All alone in here. But the time will fly by. 
 Will it? It's six months? 
 I know. But the most important thing is a healthy child. 
 For the moment he's still visiting Mary. But for how long? The Queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little Spanish things. Not to mention the Seymours with that girl of theirs. 
 What we need is someone from OUR family who will keep the King focused on Mary, reminding him of her while she is absent. 
 What? Speak.. 
 It's just...I was going to suggest Anne. 
 You couldn't control that girl last time. What makes you think it would be any different now? 
 I've had favourable reports from the Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is quite changed. 
 Why? 
 I suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough. 
 But the King visits me every day. There's no need for her. Or anyone else. 
 They just want to protect you. Leave nothing to chance. 
 But in who's interests do they imagine Anne will act? Certainly not mine. 
 Don't worry. She's had three years to forgive you. And she's not going to risk being sent away again. She'll do as she's told, I'm sure. (a beat) Besides, the most important thing is.. 
 The three of us will be together again. 
 What's the noise? I can hardly hear myself think! 
 It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her stories about life at the French court. They are particularly amusing. 
 I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and she is lying-in with a certain child in her belly! 
 It's my elder daughter, Anne, your Majesty. She has returned to court. 
 What? That awful girl, Thomas? The one that almost killed me? (a beat) You allowed her back? 
 The time abroad has done her good, your Majesty. I'm certain you'd find her much improved. 
 Really..? 
 Well, come on. Where are you, other Boleyn girl? Show your face. 
 So? What is so amusing, Anne? Perhaps we might hear and judge for ourselves? 
 I was just giving my thoughts on the new French King. 
 Which are..? 
 That for someone with such great wealth, and power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man. 
 Hah! 
 And is SO consumed by one particular rivalry he can barely think. 
 eally? And who is this rival? 
 A neighbouring King, who's name one is forbidden to mention at court. Whose reputation haunts him in his thoughts and dreams. 
 Whose armies and navy thwart his every endeavour. Whose physical and intellectual endowments are known far and wide. 
 In order to restore his confidence, this French King spends a fortune on anything that glitters, on building of castles with large towers.. 
 But these symbols of wealth and virility fail to convince. Talk among the ladies at court in France suggests.. A stops herself... 
 What? 
 That in this department too, the King has his shortcomings. 
 You should have seen the Seymours! Their faces! 
 They must have thought that with you out of the way, they had a real opportunity with that pale-faced thing of theirs, Jane... 
 Or HER, you mean. 
 What? 
 'm wary of any suggestion that Anne would serve anyone but herself. France can't have changed her THAT much. 
 n this occasion I am quite satisfied she was being loyal to you. 
 Really? 
 You're a fortunate man, George. To be blessed with G two such sisters. 
 Yes, my Lord. 
 Tell me. Are they as different in temper as they are in looks? 
 Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite distinct virtues. Mary for example.. 
 I'm familiar with Mary's. Tell me about Anne's. 
 Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say `difficult'. 
 Headstrong. With a fiery temper. 
 But with it comes great passion, too. It's both the best and the worst thing about her. a beat) There are no half measures with Anne. 
 Careful, you'll make me think I chose the wrong Boleyn girl. 
 Oh, no. I'm certain Mary is the   right choice. You will have a serene,   happy, life with her. The risk is with   Anne, it might be like being caught in a   wild summer storm. 
 Is that so..? 
 storm, you say..? 
 From the King, madam. 
 Open it. 
 I said `open it.' 
 Now close it again. And send it back. 
 She did what? 
 Sent it back, your Grace. 
 Sent it back? 
 What? Again? 
 Your Majesty. 
 Your daughter. Where is she? 
 Mary..? 
 Anne! 
 Anne..       A 
 (hurriedly dressing) Your Grace? 
 You received my gifts? 
 Yes. 
 And? They did not please you? 
 On the contrary, my Lord. They pleased me greatly. 
 Then why did you return them? 
 ecause my sister lies in bed with your child. If you wish to please me, Sir, then send her the gifts you send me. 
 I have shown Mary enough kindness and generosity. It's you I want, Anne. 
 beg you, my Lord, do not do this. What has changed so? 
 YOU. Don't you see? YOU have changed. 
 But Mary is still the mother of your child. And even if she weren't.. 
 What? 
 How could I forget that you chose her above me when we first met? You liked her better. 
 Not true.. 
 Either way, I could never betray my own sister.. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 You see! The same pain as mine! It proves you feel the same way! 
 Perhaps. But since it can never come to anything.. 
 Let me decide that. For now, you have given me hope. H ENRY goes on bended knee, kisses her hand, and goes. ANNE is left alone. She breathes out. Then looks down at her hands. 
 Sir Thomas! It's Mary..! 
 Does the King know? 
 He's on his way. 
 Any moment, your Grace. 
 Anne.. 
 Anne, I love you.. 
 Your Grace, this is not the time.. 
 I love you Anne. I cannot stop thinking about you. I cannot eat, I cannot sleep.. 
 But how could I ever TRUST you? 
 When I have seen how you have betrayed first your wife. And now my sister. 
 I vow from this moment forth I will never lie with my wife, or speak to your sister again. I will do anything you ask.. 
 Then don't acknowledge the child. 
 What? 
 A boy! 
 It's a boy, your Majesty. A strong, healthy boy. 
 What my sister has given you, I could, too. 
 Very well. 
 (a dagger in her heart) Henry..? 
 Damn you! Three years we've been working on this! Not a single detail was left to chance! And now, in the moment of our greatest glory.. 
 All I can say is you'd better have a plan. And it had better work. 
 Or what...Uncle? 
 Stop it! Both of you. What shall we do about Mary? And the child? Or have we forgotten them already? 
 Mary should go back to her husband. 
 She has been inconvenienced long enough by this family. 
 Fine. Then you can be the one to tell her. 
 I think you've earned that privilege. 
 How can you show your face in here? 
 I understand you're angry - but be assured. I did nothing, except remind him of you. 
 Oh, spare me. You did this deliberately. As revenge. (a beat) And now you have what you wanted you probably think justice has been done. 
 Well, hasn't it? 
 Be careful, that's my advice. Learn from my experience. Because he'll only do to you what he has done to me. 
 Never. I'll make sure he understands I'm a greater thing by far. That he can never have me until he makes me a far greater offer. 
 You'll never get Henry Percy back, if that's what you mean. 
 That's not what I mean. 
 And don't you ever mention his name to me again. I'll never forget how you betrayed me. 
 If that's what you think, fine. Tell yourself that. 
 I did, sister. Every day for three years. 
 Have you christened the child? 
 Henry. 
 I see. 
 And is he to take my name? Or is he to be a Fitzroy or some other sign that he is a royal bast... 
 He is to be Henry Carey. 
 I see. 
 Well, then, here we are. 
 I could pretend none of this ever happened. Start again. (a beat) If you could. 
 Well, I have done what you asked. Will you give yourself to me, now? 
 As what? 
 My one true mistress. To whom I am loyal above all others? 
 But it's not true. You are loyal to the QUEEN above all others. 
 My wife? I barely see her. 
 But she sits on a throne beside you. Accompanies you to every state function. 
 For appearance sakes only. In every other regard, our marriage is a sham. 
 Still, she is your WIFE. And ever present. And I feel her eyes on me. And those of her spies. 
 And look at us. Forever reduced to meeting in secret like this. Speaking in whispers. a beat) Hardly conducive to passion? 
 Well, what would you have me do? 
 Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for the Queen to be sent to a nunnery. 
 She will protest, of course. She won't go quietly, but she knows she has failed to give me a son, and deserves her exile. kisses ANNE) Which leaves you all alone at court.. 
 ...queen in all but name. Mother to any future heir. 
 So, is this assurance enough? Will you give yourself to me now? 
 I'd like to. But I'm afraid I find the insult too much to bear. 
 What insult? 
 Because as long as we remain unmarried, any child I gave you would forever be daubed `bastard' and I a `whore'. 
 ut what alternative is there? throws hands up in exasperation) My love for the Queen may have died, but even you must concede, she is still very much alive. A 
 Katherine of Aragon is alive. That woman is not worthy of the title `Queen'. 
 Oh, Anne. 
 I really do not know why we waste time talking of convents when you could annul the marriage. 
 Annul it? 
 That woman married two brothers and therefore sinned against God. 
 But she never consummated the marriage with my brother. 
 They were married six months. 
 Arthur was a sick man. 
 And Katherine is a shrewd woman who knew that her position as Queen would never be safe until she bedded your brother. (a beat) Talk to your advisers. They will tell you as much. 
 Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen? 
 But that's wonderful. 
 Why do you look sad? 
 Because she will contest it. Which means putting her on trial. And hearing these delicate matters in public. 
 es. But any court made up of YOUR Bishops will surely find in YOUR favour. And declare the marriage invalid. 
 hen you, my sweet Lord, will be free to remarry. (sensing his arousal) Then I can give myself to you fully. kissing him lower, lower..) And give you everything you.. (a beat) ..desire. 
 She's beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 I brought gifts from your family. A night-dress from your mother. (to YOUNG HENRY) This from your Uncle George. 
 Please be sure to thank them - though one wonders what's kept them so busy that not a single one of them found time to visit the new baby. 
 It's Anne. She's turning this country on its head. She has persuaded the king to test the validity of his marriage, and put the QueenM on trial. 
 What? 
 She continues to hold out. Expertly witholding her favours until... 
 ..until what? 
 Until he makes her the ultimate offer. 
 High stakes indeed. 
 And my brother George? 
 Continues to be promoted. As does your Father. I lost track of their latest titles. 
 ow is your husband? I heard he was unwell. 
 He is. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (O.S.) Mary..! 
 (pulling horse up) Whoa.. 
 The Queen has insisted a Papal representative be present at the trial. But Wolsey has assured me the trial will proceed for appearance sake only. We have our verdict. 
 Then what troubles you? 
 One or two friends have refused to lend their support. Among them, Thomas More. (a beat) And then there's the small matter of my conscience. 
 Why? You have justice on your side. 
 Do I? 
 `Mary Talbot'. 
 Who? 
 Mary Talbot!! The girl that married Henry Percy. It seems she has petitioned the King, demanding a divorce from her husband( on the grounds.. he can hardly bring himself to say the words) ...that his prior betrothal to you was actually.. (his knuckles whiten) ..consummated. 
 I knew this would come back to haunt us! 
 I must go to the King. 
 No! He doesn't want to see you! Or hear a word from your lips! He's far too angry. a beat) It seems the only Boleyn he will speak to, the only person who's testimony he will trust in this matter.. (a beat) ...is Mary. 
 Mary? 
 Mary. 
 We're so sorry. clears throat) About your husband.. 
 uch beautiful hair. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 I hate how this matter has come between us. I wanted to come to see you after your daughter was born, and again when your husband died, but.. 
 It's fine. 
 Leave me. Please..? 
 I'm frightened, Mary. What have I done? 
 Ah! Mary! Come in. 
 Closer.. (beckons) Into the light. 
 The Other Boleyn Girl. I'd forgotten how beautiful you were. 
 ou asked to see me, your Grace? 
 And..? 1 
 Mama? What's the matter? 
 (putting brave face on) Nothing. 
 (with difficulty) I am forever in your debt. 
 You owe me nothing, sister. I did it that we may finally draw a line beneath everything that has happened between us. 
 hen let it be exactly that. A new start between us. Here at court. 
 Thank you. But I'd rather go back to our home in the country. 
 What? That damp old ruin? With no food? Or warmth? a beat) Why don't you let your family look after you? Your children would have the best of everything here. They would grow up safe and secure. 
 ho's that? 
 The Papal Legate. Sent by the Pope to preside over the Queen's trial. 
 So, it's true. It's really happening? 
 Yes, it is. Stay with me, please? I need my sister by me side. 
 The crowds are with her. 
 The crowds have no vote. a beat) And the bishops that do are in Wolsey's pocket. 
 So..the Boleyn whores. Two former ladies of mine. Hiding in shadows. (a beat) What did I do to upset you, that you should turn against me like this? 
 You failed to give England an heir. 
 And that upsets you so? 
 What upsets the King upsets me. 
 How dare you! 
 (calling out) Katherine, Queen of England, come into court..! 
 ou want me to creep away and become a nun? Well, I shall not. You want me to lie before God and admit my first marriage was consummated? Well, it was not. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 My Lord, how have I offended you? For twenty years, I have been a true, obedient wife. I have loved all those whom you loved, and given you children though it has pleased God to take them away. If there is any just cause that you can allege against me, I will happily depart to my shame and dishonour, but I tell you, as God is my witness, there is none. 
 (defiant) You are. 
 ..then let it be in a proper court and by the only authority I recognise. His holiness himself. 
 Since it has pleased the Queen to absent herself from the court, the trial will simply proceed without her. 
 Wolsey promised the King his verdict. Instead he has humiliated him. 
 But they are continuing with the trial. And the Bishops will still find in the King's favour. 
 Yes. But without the Pope's blessing, the result will seem hollow. a frustrated gesture) If only the King would take matters into his own hands. 
 And do what? His only option would be to reject the Catholic Church? And his faith would never allow it. 
 Nor his good sense. Breaking with Rome would isolate England politically. Leave us at the mercy of the Protestants. 
 But the alternative is leaving this country without an heir. Failing in his duty as a King. And risking civil war. 
 (becoming suspicious) What? 
 Who's this? 
 Go, on.. 
 My name is Henry. 
 Is it, now? A fine name. (raises eyebrow) And how old are you? 
 Four, Sir. 
 I think so. Would you like to see it? 
 Now, `on guard'. 
.. 
 How dare you! (struggling) Take your hands off me.. 
 Now you will give yourself to me. 
 I thought I had made myself clear. Until we are married, there is no questi.. 
 Silence! Enough of your GAMES! (tearing at her dress) I have torn apart this country for you, gone against every principle in my heart, I've endured the doubts and counsel of good men and silenced them with the axe...just to be with you.. 
 Now prove to me it was worth the sacrifice. 
 Stop, you are hurting me..! 
 How was he with you? As a lover? 
 Tender. a beat) Surprisingly so. a beat) Why? 
 No reason. 
 (in LATIN, we see sub-titles) Do you, Henry Tudor, take Anne Boleyn as your lawful wedded wife..? 
 I do. 
 Did you hear? On the way to the church? They were calling me a witch. 
 All that will die down as soon as they get to know you. 
 But what if it doesn't? What if they hate me forever? 
 They won't. They will see how much the King loves you, and follow. 
 (haunted, hollow) How much the King loves me? 
 ister, I wonder if you've given any thought..to the matter of my returning to the country. With the children. 
 What? No! I need you here more than ever. Besides, as the Queen's sister, you can't live alone out there like some gypsy. We need to make you a proper match. 
 What about the Duke of Suffolk? 
 All the ladies at court are mad for him. Or Lord Fardingly. indicates an OLD courtier, in his 60's) Marry him and you'd own half Scotland.. 
 Wait! Mary.. 
 I couldn't help overhearing. And before you agree to any of your sister's matches, let me just say.. 
 ..I have saved money...not a lot...but enough. I've my eye on a place in the West...Tatton...near where I grew up.. 
 hat? (surely this is a joke) Stafford? 
 Mary...I love you. There..I've said it. From the moment I joined your family.. 
 Wait.. 
 It was you, wasn't it? At the masked ball? 
 Yes. 
 Oh, Stafford.. 
 Mary..I have watched how your family has treated you. (MORE) 
 But it's impossible. You know that. Now Anne's Queen, my family would never allow it. 
 And you would CARE? What THEY think? After everything they have done to you? 
 God, I look hideous. 
 Does it hurt? 
 Little nips and stabs. 
 Just imagine. It it's a boy. The unholy trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt to the next King of England. 
 But if it isn't? The King will take that as evidence of God's displeasure. And will turn further against me. He's already become so cold. 
 They say you can tell by the shape of the stomach. Mary, what do you say? Boy or girl? 
 What's the matter with her? 
 You've been like this for days. 
 What? 
 Mooning. You're not in love, are you? 
 What? (blushing) Certainly not.. 
 (flustered) In love! 
 And again, one more.. 
 It's done, your Majesty..! 
 Well done... 
 And..? 
 It's a girl! 
 A beautiful, healthy girl. 
 A girl? 
 She has named her Elizabeth. After your mother. 
 Is the child healthy? 
 Perfectly, Sir. 
 Well, if we can have a healthy daughter, we can have a healthy son. 
 Who is it? 
 Lady Somerset, I believe. 
 Yesterday it was the wife of the French Ambassador. The day before with the Countess of Salisbury. (a frustrated gesture) How could he DO that to me? So SOON? 
 Now I know how it must have been for you. 
 (O.S.) You can't ignore me like this. I am your wife! Why don't you just admit it! 
 (O.S.) ecause it's not true! 
 (O.S.) Liar! I can smell the whore on you! Get away from me! You disgust me! 
 I struck him today. What am I doing? I am destroying this all on my own.. 
 I can't sleep at night! And without sleep I cannot think! 
 Oh, Anne.. 
 nd it's getting more and more difficult to arouse him. Some nights he cannot do it...at all. I have to resort to ever more disgusting...then he hates himself in the morning...hates me even more for what I made him do... 
 It's slipping away, Mary. I can feel it. 
 And..? 
 And so, it's come to this. Our sister is with child, and all England's fate is in the balance. 
 The King will have to move swiftly to silence his enemies. He will claim innocence. That he was corrupted. Anne will swiftly be replaced as Queen, by someone more `acceptable'. (a beat) And we Boleyns will never be able to show our faces at court again. 
 That's no bad thing. 
 Anyone with any sense would have run away from this hell-hole already. As far as they could go. 
 ike the wise William Stafford. 
 What? 
 You didn't know? Sold up and went. Left for the country. Just like that. Gone to live in some place called.. 
 (under her breath) ..Tatton. 
 Where he grew up, apparently. Did you know he came from a better stable than all of us? His grandmother was a Beaufort, cousin to the King. And he never mentioned it. (shrugs) Who'd have guessed? 
 I'm fine, thank you. (visibly paranoid) Just a bad dream. 
 (flinches as she speaks) But fetch my brother and sister, will you? 
 I lost it. Almost without pain. And so fast it was over in a moment. 
 (heart cracks) Oh, Anne.. 
 ou have to get rid of it. Bury it. Get rid of it somehow. No one must know. 
 It's not the first. Miscarriage. 
 They will take it as proof that I cannot bear children. That I am cursed by God. And should be dispensed with. 
 Why? There's still time. You could sleep with the King, and fall pregnant again. No one would know.. 
 he King would never lie with me now, and risk damaging the `child' he believes I'm carrying.. a beat) Besides, he is barely capable anymore. And I couldn't go through that again. 
 No, if I am to survive..I have to take matters into my own hands. 
 I..I don't understand. 
 I need a baby, Mary. rolling eyes) Must I spell it out? 
 You mean lying with another man? 
 Of course. 
 But that would be treason. 
 esides, where would you find someone you could trust? 
 Obviously, it would have to be someone close. Very close.. 
 What..? horrified) No..! 
 Stop it, Anne! It's madness.. 
 Don't you see? This affects all of us. If I go down, so do all of you. The only way to save ourselves..is to do this.. (a beat) And pray it's a boy. 
 I can't listen to this.. (feeling nauseous) ...this is monstrous.. 
 Mary, sit down.. 
 No, Anne! I understand you have had a shock tonight. A terrible shock. But there is no need for this.. 
 Come, George.. 
 George is staying. He understands this involves the whole family.. 
 No. Come, George.. 
 George, is STAYING! 
 (her heart cracking) I pray for you both. 
 Mary! Come back! 
 Come on, darling wake up. 
 Where are we going? 
 Away from here. Far, far away. 
 Who lives here, Mother? 
 Someone. (clears throat) A friend. 
 William? 
 Mama, I'm hungry. 
 Me, too. 
 I'm sorry. a beat) I just didn't know where else to go. 
. 
 Do you, Mary, take William as your lawful wedded husband? 
 I do. 
..           M 
 What is it? 
 News from court. 
 hat? It's Anne. Tell me.. (fearing the worst) She miscarried the child? 
: 
 They say it was deformed...monstrous. She is charged with incest and of summoning the devil. Your brother, too. He has already been sentenced. Anne is in the Tower, awaiting trial. 
: 
 I must go. 
 And do what? George is doomed. For Anne it's only a matter of time. 
 I can petition the King.. 
 ou think he will listen? It's his own neck he's saving by getting rid of them, can't you see? 
 Fine, go. But if you do, you might as well kiss your children goodbye. You are Anne's sister. That alone makes you her accomplice and co-conspirator. 
 I have no choice. Anne and George are my family. I cannot desert them. 
 And what of your new family? Your 
? 
 Henry and Catherine have you. Anne and George have no one. (a beat) I'm sorry.. 
 It is a sad day for England when the nobles do not rise for their Queen. 
 And even sadder when that same Queen is charged with adultery and incest. 
 Charged is different to convicted, Uncle. Or is it not? In this court? 
 Master Cromwell, read out the indictment.. 
 The charge is that in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of our Sovereign Henry, King of England, his wife, the Queen, being seduced by the Devil, did knowingly commit adultery, high treason and offences against God. 
 How do you plead? 
 Not guilty, my Lord. 
 My noble Lords..the love I have for my brother is the love any sister would have for someone with whom she has grown up in the same house, nursed when sick, played games as children, shared life's celebrations. 
 That is the love I have for him. Not what you suggest. 
 (V/O) Judge me, my Lords, as you see fit. But never forget that your verdicts will be judged again by God, in the greatest court of all.. 
 (V/O) My Lords, the time has come to cast your vote. 
 (unflinching) Guilty. 
 In which case, the burden falls on me to pass sentence. 
. 
 ho was it? 
 Mary..? 
 Leave us. 
 ALL of you! 
 Your Majesty.. (falling into a deep curtsey as HENRY closes the door ensuring their privacy) I understand my family has offended you. But having taken my brother today, I beg you to spare my sister. 
 Oh, Mary... 
 I realise you must replace Anne as Queen. (a beat) But must she die, too? 
 She has been tried and found guilty. 
 You could send her away. 
 I am bound by the law. 
 You could send her to a nunnery. No one would know. 
 Anne? To a nunnery? 
 There is precedent, my Lord. Louis of France did it, too. When his wife could not conceive. 
 The French Queen was a blameless woman. Your sister a witch. 
 I understand Anne has offended you. I ask only that if there is any regret you might..feel yourself. 
 What? 
 For your part in the matter.. 
 ..does not unduly colour your thinking. Killing Anne will not make it go away. (a beat) It would only make it worse. 
 How could I have made that mistake? 
 o. I will reflect on the matter. 
 Oh, Anne.. 
 How has it come to this? 
 Ssshhhhh. 
 They're letting the crowds in. 
 It's all right. You will be spared. The King as good as gave me his word. 
 The King saw you? 
 Yes. 
 We all made a mess of that, didn't we? We all underestimated little Mary. 
 I don't think he ever stopped loving you. 
 That's not true. 
 It is. He never loved me in the same way. And deep down you know it. 
 You should have been Queen. You even gave him a son. But instead all this has happened because.. (a beat) Because I couldn't bear to be the Other Boleyn Girl. 
 And now look? 
 Hold me.. 
 You'll look after Elizabeth? 
 It will be all right. Trust me. 
 he couldn't ask for a better moth... (breaks down, composes herself) 
 e will spare you. I am sure of it. 
 I...I come here to die...a loyal subject.. 
.. 
 Come on.. 
 ..I..I do not blame the King. Never was there a more just or goodly Lord.. 
 ..I beg God's forgiveness and his mercy.. 
 (V.O.) "Madam..." 
 (V.O.) ..the King has spared you because of his respect and affection for you and because you are the mother of his son." 
 (V.O.) "But you risked your life coming to court and you are advised you not to do so again. You will not be shown the same clemency a second time. Your sister Anne was tried and found guilty, her crimes were high treason and she deserves to die. Cromwell."

 
 Leif, let's do the deed before another night falls. The crew's near mutiny. 
 Know this! The first man to turn will taste my steel in his guts. 
 But we've surely gone far enough. 
 That accursed box must be thrown off the edge of the world. We will go until we can go no more... 
 ...Land ho. 
'S P.O.V. 
 
 (GASPS) By Odin's beard... 
. 
 Be quick, Witch. Let the deed be done. 
 Oh Loki, ancient one. Thy mischief dwell now in waters, base and bland. And in waves and sand thy magic forever sleep... 
 look about fearfully. 
 ERICSON (CONT.) Back to the ship men, hurry. 
 Captain, you've discovered a new world. It is your right to name it. 
 Leave that to the Italians. We're never coming back here. Never. This land is now cursed. 
 Look at those clouds rollin' in, man. Freaky weather. 
 Hey Charlie, can you go over these stats? We're supposed to have a complete report before lunch. 
 Woah. Sorry Stanley, I just had my weave tightened and my head is killing me. Be a pal and take those over to Hinkleman, will ya? 
 Hi guys. Did you have any luck with those concert tickets Stanley? 
 I sure did. Friday night, just like you wanted. 
 Oh, Stanley, that's wonderful. 
 What time should I pick you up? 
 Gee, I don't know. My best girlfriend just got into town and I know she'd love to go. Can we get an extra ticket for her? 
 Well... uh, actually it's sold out. I was kinda lucky to get these. 
 She's only going to be in town a couple of days and I just can't let her sit at home all alone. Are you sure there isn't something we can do? 
 You know what? Here. You two go. 
 Oh Stanley, I couldn't do that. 
 No really. Go ahead. It's okay. I hate concerts anyway. All that, you know... music floating around. 
 That is so sweet. Sheila's just going to love this. 
 So maybe you and I can get together over the weekend? 
 I'm not sure what's going on, but just give me a call. You know I like to be spontaneous. 
 Oh, sure. Me too. 
 Stanley Ipkiss, you are the nicest guy. 
 That's it. 
 What? 
 The kiss of death. As soon as they use the "N" word it's all over. 
 So maybe I am a nice guy. So what? 
 You are a rug. I am talking astro-turf here. You're letting these women sharpen their cleats on you. 
 Hey, I'm a gentleman. If they can't appreciate that, it's their problem. 
 You spend too much time being "nice" to a girl, you'll wind up sittin' around listening to her complain about the son of a bitch she really loves. 
 Charlie, you are a very sick puppy. 
 Wake up, Stanley! These are the nineties. We're dealing with an entire generation of dysfunctional love junkies. You can't romance 'em. You gotta confuse 'em. It's the only thing that gets their attention. 
 (PAUSES) Let me demonstrate. You see that girl over there? 
 CHARLIE (CONT.) Hi Lisa. 
 (forgets his name) Oh, hi... 
 Charlie. 
 That's right. Sorry. 
 Lisa, this may seem a little odd, but my friend over there and I were having this discusion and I thought maybe you could settle it for us. 
 I'll help out if I can. 
 (SHEEPISHLY) Actually, I don't know... this is kind of a personal question. 
 That's okay. Go ahead. 
 Alright. Just for the sake of argument, if I wasn't a happily married man... am I the kind of guy you'd go out with? 
 Oh, um... I don't know. 
 (PAUSES) Well... yeah. I guess I would. 
 Lisa, I have terrific news for you. 
 What? 
 I'm not married! Is this perfect or what? Listen, there's not a lot of women willing to come right out like that and admit they're attracted to a guy, but... 
 CHARLIE (CONT.) Jeez... make up your mind. 
 Okay. Bad example. Some of these women got so much baggage they need an emotional sky cap. I'll tell you what Stanley, tonight I'm gonna take you on a love safari, deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle. 
 And where's that? 
 The Monkey's Paw. Hottest new club in town. It's a guaranteed skirt alert and no dead beats allowed. 
 So how are we gonna get in? 
 Woah, do I detect a little self-image problem there, buddy? You just leave everything to me. This, my friend is going to be the perfect night on the town. 
 Hold the phone. Killer at three o'clock. 
'S P.O.V. 
 (hushed reverence) Oh my god... A perfect dime. The dame of dames. The Moby of my dick. 
 Easy Charlie. You'll sprain your eyes. 
 Excuse me, where can I open a new account? 
 You've come to the right place, ma'am. Just step right this way and pull up a chair... 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a complete wreck. Will you hold this please? 
 Here, let me take that for you. 
 Thanks. 
 So, uh, what kind of account did you have in mind? 
 (smiles sweetly) Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm just terrible with things like that. That's an interesting tie Mr...? 
 Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss... 
 Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet you. 
 The, uh... pleasure's all mine. 
 May I? I'm such a mess. 
 Oh... of course. 
 As I was saying about that tie. It's like one of those, what do you call them, ink blot tests. 
 A Rorschach test. 
 That's it. It looks like... um. A young woman riding bareback. You know, like a Lady Godiva or something. 
 Really? I don't think I can... 
 Or... if that's not a horse it could be two lovers. A man and a woman. That would be the woman on top, of course. 
 (MESMERIZED) ...Of course. 
 What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss? 
 I don't know. ...Bold colors. It's a power tie, y'know? They're supposed to make you feel... powerful. 
 Does it work? 
 Sort of. It's just a tie. Now, about that account.

 DORIAN (CONT.) Hey, will you guys keep it down back there? 
 DR. FREEZE That's cool, man. Freeze it right there. 
 DR. FREEZE Layout's not bad. We got us a sweet little Perkins/Jenning time lock. But them motion detectors are putting the chill on my thrill. 
 DR. FREEZE Hey, you're talkin' with the Doctah, man. It's all about time and money. 
 DR. FREEZE Not cool. What about the coin? 
 DR. FREEZE What you talkin' about, man? 
 DR. FREEZE Yeah? Then I'm chump number one, man. 
 DORIAN (CONT.) The Valhalla Casino. Twenty mil of glass, neon, booze and dice. World class sucker bait. The grand opening is Saturday night and it will drive this two bit club of mine out of existence. But I say if you can't beat 'em, take 'em over. 
 DR. FREEZE Yeah? That's Arnie the Swede's place, man and he is one ice cold meatball eatin' motha fucker. 
 
 Hold it up right here, please. 
 riddled partition as the cab continues to barrel through traffic. 
 Hold up?! No hold up! I keel you very well! I splatter your guts big time, Mr. Cowboy Man! 
 No! No! He only wants you to stop the cab! 
 (now totally calm) Hokay. Pardon you very much. 
 It's alright, Stanley. 
 (SOFTLY) I hate this town. I really hate this town. 
 Why are you getting out here? 
 I gotta pick up my car. 
 Fine. Now don't forget. Ten o'clock at the Monkey's Paw. I've already got us lined up with a couple of authentic dimes. 
 Charlie, please. The last time you said that you showed up with two lesbian mud-wrestlers. 
 Well, I can't promise we'll get that lucky again... Later! 
 ...Hello? 
 Hang on. Hong on. Don't get your panties in a twist. 
 (examining part) Hey Irv, what the hell is this? 
 (eyes it carefully) Ohh... I dunno. About seven hundred bucks. 
 Now what can I do for you, Bub? 
 I'm here for the Civic. 
 Japanese car, right? Kind of a nasty pea soup green? 
 Well, they call it Emeral Forest, actually... 
 Burt! Pea green Civic! 
 Green Civic... Green Civic. Oh yeah! Brake drums are still on order and I'm only halfway through rebuilding the trans. 
 But I just brought it in for an oil change! 
 Yeah? Well you're lucky we caught those other problems before they caused some serious trouble. 
 Alright. Alright. When will it be ready? 
 Come back tomorro... (Burt shakes his head "no".) ...First thing next wee... (Burt shakes again) ...next month? (Burt shakes an enthusiastic "yes".) Yeah, first thing next month. That's if we can get the parts. 
 What am I going to do in the meantime? I can't afford to keep taking cabs all over town. 
 Oh, hell... we can take care of that! (to Burt archly) Hey Burt, bring around the loaner. (to Stanley) And for you little buddy, only ten bucks a day. 
 It's a classic. 
 Hey, Stanley. Nice wheels. What is that, a Rolls Canardley? 
 A what? 
 You know, a Rolls Canardley. Rolls down one hill canardley roll up the next. (he cracks up) 
 We are not discussing the car, okay? 
 Whatever you say, man. 
 What do you think? Pretty terrific, huh? This place make Sodom and Gomorrah look like Mayberry. 
 Hey, isn't that... 
 Right. The wet dream from the bank. 
 (PAUSES) Hold on... I think I see my future ex-wife. 
 Hey Charlie! Charlie! 
 
 (WAVES) We're in luck. It's Barbie and Pebbles. 
 Doesn't it bother you that all the women you know are named after cartoon characters? 
 We've been waiting out here for hours. Can you get us in? 
 No, problemo. Ladies, this is my pal Stanley Ipkiss. (leans closer) Stanley's very influential in the banking business. 
 Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What's happening man? 
 CHARLIE (CONT.) (to the girls) This will just take a second. (to the other bouncer) Yo Nick! It's me... Charlie! 
 Forget it, Charlie. I refuse to stand here waiting to be judged by these power-mad steroid jockeys. 
 How much cash you got on you? 
 What? 
 You heard me. How much you got? 
 I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks. 
 Hand it over. 
 No way. 
 Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only carrying plastic. C'mon man, you want to stand out here all night? 
 (subtly flashing bills) Hey Bobby! 
 Charlie, how you doin' man? Long time no see. 
 Hey, wait a minute! Charlie! 
 STANLEY (CONT.) I'm with them! Hey, Bobby! 
 Hey! Leggo... awk! 
 
 (SMILES) Oh... Stanley. Hi. 
 TINA (CONT.) Are you okay?

 Hey, you! What are you doing down there? 
 I was just looking for... (holds up Mask) My mask. 
 Thanks Reno, you're the greatest. 
 G'night, doll. 
 Yeah, well don't get used to it. I'm not going to start running cons for you again, Dorian. I'm a singer now and that's it. 
 Who latched on to who? 
 (downs a shot) Don't push me, Nicky. I might just take a walk I should have taken a long time ago. 
 (CHUCKLES) Easy, baby. Easy. (to his men) I love it when she gets pissed. 
 DORIAN (CONT.) C'mere. You take a hike and who's gonna kiss you like Dorian Tyrel. 
 DORIAN (CONT.) C'mon. Who? 
 Nobody. 
 Sorry. I never get personal in front of the help. 
 DR. FREEZE She just might, man. The bitch is trouble. 
 Okay, Mr. Ipkiss. Try to be a little more careful next time. 
 Thanks Officer. 
 Hey, mister... 
 DEATH'S HEAD You a cop or something? 
 AS-FASHION oddments. 
 Uh... no. They just gave me a lift. 
 DEATH'S HEAD A cop chauffeur? I never seen that before. How about you boys? 
 Alright, you guys. It's been a tough night. I haven't got any money. I haven't got a car. All I have is this and you're welcome to it. 
 DEATH'S HEAD Hey, man. You got us all wrong. We don't want any trouble. I was just going to ask you for the time. That's all. You got the time? 
 Uh... yeah. 
 DEATH'S HEAD (holding up his prize) See, I only wanted the time! Heh, he, heh... 
 APARTMENT "A" - MANAGER 
 MRS. PEENMAN Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what time it is? 
 Actually, no. 
 MRS. PEENMAN It's three o'clock in the morning! First, you wake up the entire building laughing it up with your pals. Then, you come in and start squeak - (sees puddles) My new carpet! Just look at that! This is coming out of your cleaning deposit Ipkiss! 
 (SOFTLY) Are you done? 
 MRS. PEENMAN ...Yes. 
 I think I'll be going to bed now. 
 Hello, Milo. 
 STANLEY (CONT.) Easy, buddy. I missed you too. 
 
 STANLEY (CONT.) C'mon, Milo. I'm beat. (to the dog YIPS) Okay, okay. One throw. 
 Easy. This is the best part. 
 STANLEY (CONT.) (calls out) Sorry Mrs. Peenman. 
 T.V. 
 DR. NEUMAN That's correct. The truth is we all wear masks, metaphorically speaking. We repress the Id... our darkest desires and hide behind a more socially acceptable image of ourselves in order to cope with the frustrations of our day to day lives. 
 Think I'm repressed, Milo? 
 STANLEY (CONT.) 
 (HALF-HEARTEDLY) Nah. 
 T.V. 
 The book is "The Masks We Wear," by Dr. Arthur Neuman. Thank you Dr. Neuman. 
 No thank you, Dr. Neuman. 
 SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly hops off the bed. 
 STANLEY (CONT.) Whoa. 
 STANLEY (CONT.) Naw...

 Hey mister... 
 DEATH'S HEAD #1 (grins evilly) ...You got the time? 
 (wiggles eyebrows) Why of course, Cubbie. I got all the time in the world! 
 London, Paris, Rome, standard, substandard and no standards at all! And for our English friends we have... Big Ben! 
 DEATH'S HEAD #1 Big Ben? 
 DEATH'S HEAD #2 Get him! 
 And for my next trick...

 MASK (CONT.) A few more twists of the wrist and for you, Cubbie.

 MASK (CONT.) Wait a minute. This is incredible! Why, with these powers I could be a superhero! I could fight crime... Work for world peace... 
 MASK (CONT.) But first!... 
 Now these are serious chili dogs. 
 I know. Here's the proof... (lets out a long BUUURP) Aaah. Even tastier the second time around. 
 Hey Burt, pull on my finger. 
 No way, man. 
 No, really. Go ahead. 
 Irv, don't... 
 (PROUDLY) That, my friend is the sweet smell of success. 
 
 (SHRUGS) No style. I give it a five tops. 
 Okay, how about... Soprano. 
 Fine muscle control. 
 And now for my grand finale, THX... The audience is listening! 
 Hey, 40 watt... we're closed! Nobody's here. 
 Ah... but you're here. 
 What I mean is... 
 Nobody's here that wants to help you. 
 But I'm here to help you. 
! 
 Sounds like you have a little exhaust problem there! 
 MASK (CONT.) We better do a few touch ups before you have some serious trouble. 
 out of bed with a start. 
 A dream... It was only a dream. 
 LT. KELLAWAY Nice PJ's pal. 
 Can I help you? 
 LT. KELLAWAY You're Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss? 
 That's right. 
 LT. KELLAWAY Some kind of prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman. 
 (swallows hard) Really? I didn't hear a thing. 
 LT. KELLAWAY Then you must be a pretty sound sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she unloaded a couple rounds of 20 ott buckshot five feet from your door. 
 
 
 (GASPS) That's... impossible! 
 LT. KELLAWAY Excuse me? 
 That's... a, possible. See, I have this inner ear problem. (wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously) Sometimes I can't hear a thing. 
 (SKEPTICAL) Is that a fact? 
 What? 
 Forget it. 
 KELLAWAY (CONT.) Here. You remember anything unusual about last night, anything at all, call me. 
 Sure... thanks. 
 STANLEY (CONT.) Milo, it was real! How could it all be... real? 
 STANLEY (CONT.) Oh my god. I'm late! 
 Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta admit your description is pretty tough to swallow. 
 MRS. PEENMAN Then you can choke on it for all I care. I saw what I saw. 
 Right. (refers to notes) A green head the size of a pumpkin, purple zoot suit and spats. That's a pretty serious fashion risk for any self-respecting second story man. 
 Lt., we just got an emergency call from a mechanic on 67th Street. 
 What? 
 Some kind of assault and battery. Sound pretty bad. 
 
 (SIGHS) Alright. Dont' worry Mrs. Peenman, we'll find this guy for you. Officer Deluca here has a few forms you'll have to fill out. 
 Milo! Keys! Keys! 
 Good boy. 
 #3 I want a proctologist standing by! Yeah, you heard me! The best one you can find. 
 We were able to get a description Lt., but it's pretty weird. 
 
 (SIGHS) Let me guess... Big green head. Zoot suit. 
 How did you... 
 Whoever this guy is, he's a world class twisto. 
 Excuse me, Lt., I'm with the Evening Star. Can you tell me what happened here? 
 Sorry. Too early to comment. 
 It looks like some kind of mob scare tactic. 
 I said no comment. Now break it up. This is a crime scene. 
 What happened to you last night? The girls and I were looking all over for you. 
 I uh, didn't feel so good. I decided to go home early. 
 As a matter of fact, you don't look so good. You got to take better care of yourself, man. 
 How was the club? 
 Are you kidding? It was hotter than a pistol. Did you see the paper? 
 No. 
 Your girlfriend got a great review. 
 "Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey's Paw." 
 Ipkiss! You're forty minutes late! Every time you do that you're robbing this bank of its time and money! 
 Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won't happen again. 
 (snatches newspaper) If you weren't so busy ogling girlie pictures you'd get some work done around here. 
 Ah... She's a prospective client of Stanley's, sir. 
 (sudden attitude change) She is? Well... Next time she comes in see that you send her directly to my office. 
 Yes sir, Mr. Dickey. 
 Look at that little creep. If it wasn't for his daddy he'd be out somewhere shakin' down school kids for lunch money. 
 You think she ever will come back, Charlie? 
 Who knows? Forget about her, Stanley. A dame like that is always looking for the B.B.D. The bigger better deal. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar. 
 You don't know that. She's an artist. Maybe she's sensitive. 
 Yeah. She can sense a guy's credit line at two hundred yards. Stanley, you need a girl you can depend on. Someone a little more down to earth... someone like... 
 Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find Stanley Ipkiss? 
 Like her! Someone like her. (straightens tie) As a matter of fact I could use someone like her myself. (rises as Peggy approaches) Hel-lo there. May I be of some assistance? 
 Stanley Ipkiss? 
 PEGGY (CONT.) Hi. I'm Peggy Brandt. I'm with the Evening Star. 
 Oh, hi. I already have a subscription, thanks. 
 Oh no, actually I just wanted to ask you a few questions. 
 Really? About what? 
 Ripley Auto Finishing. You're a customer of theirs aren't you? 
 I... uh. No. I think you must have made a mistake. 
 Isn't this a form of theirs you filled out? 
 (nervous chuckle) Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess I have stopped in there once or twice, Miss... what did you say your name was? 
 Peggy Brandt. 
 Wait a minute... Peggy Brandt of "Ask Peggy"? 
 That's right. 
 (brightens up) You printed my letter last year, remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last." 
 You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do you realize how much mail we got about that letter? There's hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like you. 
 Are you serious? 
 Of course. DO you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town? Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood. 
 Why are you covering this story? 
 They cut my salary. I just can't make it by on "Dear Peggy" anymore. The truth is, I want to be a real reporter and if I can break this story I know they'll let me. (sits closer) Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto is a crooked operation. They may even have had ties to the Mob. I'm not out to get you. I just want the truth. 
 I wish I knew the truth, Peggy. I really do. 
 inside. 
 Cut the crap. Dorian. What's so important that I had to come here in person? 
 That's impossible. He was approved six months ago. 
 
 (CHUCKLES) I owe you nothing, you little piece of shit. I got your liquor license when nobody else would touch... 
 DORIAN (CONT.) Nice. Hey, Eddy... call my florist. Two dozen pink carnations to Mrs. Snell with my regrets over her husband's untimely accident. 
 (GASPING) No... please. I can do it. I can make it happen. 
 DORIAN (CONT.) Shut the Swede down, Snell. We'll buy him out cheap with a little collateral the bank is about to provide us. (looks at his men) And Gentlemen... we are going to be in the casino business. 
 Or it could be two lovers. That would be the woman on top, of course... 
 Forget her, Stanley. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar. 
 Every time you're late Ipkiss, you're robbing this bank! 
 DR. NEUMAN We must repress our Id... our deepest darkest desires. 
 Hey, are you okay. 
 I am now. C'mere, baby. 
 
 (SWOONS) Oh, Stanley!

 (COUGH) Tell Scarlet I do give a damn... 
 I... I...! 
 Drop it, Tyrel! 
 I got probable cause. A couple of your boys were spotted knocking over Edge City Bank. 
 One of them was wearin' some kind of big green mask. 
 This isn't harassment. You want to see some harassment? (to his men) Search the place, boys. 
 Well what d'ya know? I guess they gave you one too. 
 Lt., we got a stiff upstairs. One of the guys from the heist. 
 (cuffs him) Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours, Tyrel. You're comin' downtown. 
 Then just think of this as the city's way of showing you a little hospitality. (pats him on the cheek) I'll stop by to tuck you in myself. 
 
 You're on your own, boys. 
 Don't worry, Lt. If he's in there, well get him. 
 And if he's not, I got a feeling I know where to find him. 
 LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.) Police. Open up. 
 Oh my god! 
 LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.) Ipkiss! I know you're in there. 
 All right, I'm coming! 
 Lieutenant, what a surprise! What can I do for you? 
 LT. KELLAWAY You can answer a few questions. 
 I've got to get ready for work. 
 LT. KELLAWAY Trust me. Your bank's opening late today. 
 Here... mostly. Is something wrong? 
 LT. KELLAWAY Maybe, yes. Maybe, no. Maybe it's all just a crazy coincidence that this so called "Mask" character always seems to be wherever you are. 
 Mask -- who? 
 LT. KELLAWAY Don't insult my intelligence, Ipkiss. First, he's spotted in your building, then the bank where you work and now I find this at the Monkey's Paw. 
 Milo. No! (moves the dog away) Okay, so I went out on the town last night. A guy's got to have a little fun. 
 LT. KELLAWAY In your jammies? 
 Naw, I just took 'em with me in case I didn't make it home. I don't know about you, Lieutenant. But I've got a pretty good track record with the ladies. 
 LT. KELLAWAY Wait a second... you smell that? 
 What? 
 
 (SNIFFS) Bullshit. I hate the smell of bullshit. Don't even think about leaving town, Ipkiss. I'll be in touch. 
 What are we gonna do, Milo? What are we gonna do? 
 C.U. - 
 
 I don't know, boss. That's one helluva rubber mask. 
 LT. KELLAWAY Where's the lab report? 
 We got fingerprints on some of the currency, but nothing matches Tyrel's men. Looks like this guy beat 'em to the punch. 
 LT. KELLAWAY Get the bank's employee files and run down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss. 
 You figure it was an inside job? 
 LT. KELLAWAY Yeah, and all I need is a couple of prints to lock this wack job up 'till doomsday. 
 You. You're losing it Dorian. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 C'mon, did it look to you like I had a choice? 
 MR. DICKEY Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our hands here and you stroll in over an hour late. If I have to put up with your slovenly... 
 
 (EXPLODES) Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell your daddy how you're running this branch like it's your own personal piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed! 
 MR. DICKEY That will be all, Ipkiss. 
 Woah! What side of who's bed did you wake up on? 
 I'm not sure. 
 (TWITCHES) I haven't exactly been myself lately. 
 (WARILY) Yeah, well you look like you could use a little R and R there buddy... and as a matter of fact I've got just the ticket. Or should I say tickets? 
 I'm afraid to ask. 
 Saturday night. Grand opening of the Valhalla Casino. Serious skirt alert. Everybody who's anybody will be there. What do you say? 
 STANLEY (CONT.) Excuse me a second. 
 Tina... What are you doing here? 
 I heard about the robbery. I guess I just wanted to make sure you were okay. 
 Oh, don't worry about me. 
 (TWITCHES) I'm fine. 
 Are you sure? You look a little... 
 I'm just having a little trouble sleeping is all. 
 (BEAT) I guess you won't want to open that account after all this... 
 I'm not so sure I'll have much to open an account with anymore. 
 What about the nightclub? I thought you were doing great. 
 I don't know how much longer I can stay there Stanley. Things are getting a little intense. 
 Well, there must be plenty of other places you could sing. Maybe even get a record deal... 
 I wish it was that easy. There's thousands of girls out there just like me who... 
 Not just like you. You've got a voice like... like an angel. 
 (lights a cigarette) An angel huh? That's the first time I've heard that one. 
 No, I mean it. You really do. 
 I can vamp my way through a tune. But that's not really singing. 
 What is it with you, Tina? Why don't you believe in yourself? 
 
 (SIGHS) I guess I've just heard a lot of promises from a lot of guys. In the end they all wanted the same thing and it wasn't a song. 
 So maybe you've been singing for the wrong guys. 
 I'm not so sure there's any other kind. Not for me, anyway. 
 (RISES) Well, I'm glad nobody got hurt. 
 Yeah. 
 What about this guy, the Mask? Do the cops have a line on him? 
 I'm not sure. Why are you interested? 
 Promise you won't say anything? 
 Sure. 
 He came to the club last night and he was just so... well, different. I haven't been able to get him off my mind. 
 Really? They say he's pretty weird looking. 
 Yeah. He's ugly... but he's kinda cool... y'know, like Mick Jagger. 
 You really think so? 
 Yeah. If you hear anything about him, would you call me at the club? 
 Actually... I sort of know the guy. 
 What? 
 The Mask. We're - old college buddies him and I. 
 Are you serious? 
 Oh yeah. To tell you the truth, I'm sorta covering for him on this bank thing. He's not such a bad guy, really. He just gets a little carried away. 
 I'll say. Do you think you could give him a message? 
 I suppose so. 
 Tell him I want to see him again 
 When? I mean, I'd need to tell him exactly. 
 How about seven o'clock tonight at Peninsula Park. 
 I'll be... I mean, I'll make sure he's there. 
 Sorry, doll. I had the locks changed this afternoon. 
 You what? You can't do that! 
 You've known we're going condo for six months, Peggy. I can't stall the owner a minute longer. Either you pony up the downpayment or you're out. 
 Just a couple more days, Phil. The paper's ready to give me a full time job. 
 I've heard that one before. 
 C'mon, at least let me get a few of my things. 
 Don't make me regret this. We get a certified check by noon tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort you out of here. 
 Thanks Phil. You're a sweetheart. 
 Who... Who are you? 
 You give me something worth printing and I'll get you your money. What's this about? 
 The guy they call the Mask and why Dorian Tyrel's willing to pay fifty large to get him. 
 How do I find this Tyrel? 
 Careful, sweet meat. You break this story and he just might find you. 
 
 Dorian... thanks for coming by, kid. 
 That? It was nothing. He was a pain in my ass anyway. Here, sit down, sit down. 
 Thanks, but it might be a little early to celebrate. As a matter of fact that's why I asked you to stop by. 
 Here... have a little something to eat. That's Svenska meatballs, kid. The real thing. 
 So, I tell you Dorian, it's a terrible shame. I put all my hard work into this beautiful casino and what do you think? All the sudden I got all kinda problems with the city. Big problems. The whole deal could fold. 
 What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy a sweetheart? Thanks for the offer Dorian, but I think maybe I can solve this myself. 
 That's right. You know that Councilman you got in your pocket? 
 SWEDE (CONT.) Well now you've got 'im in your mouth. How you like that? 
 SWEDE (CONT.) (to Dorian) Now listen close scumbag! You want to bw in business with me? Okay, we're partners now. I'm takin' fifty per cent off the Monkey's Paw. You screw with me again and I'll send you straight down to Hell with your scumbag councilman. You can apologize for eatin' him for lunch. 
 Good. Now get out of my sight. 
 Oh Dorian, here's a couple tickets to my grand opening. Stop by. And try to dress up nice. It's good for business.

 DR. NEUMAN This is extremely unusual, Mr. Ipkiss. Barging in without an appointment or... 
 Look, you're the big expert on masks, right? Well, I've got an emergency here! (his face TWITCHES) 
 DR. NEUMAN Try to calm yourself. Now this woman you were telling me about, I'm not sure I understand the problem. 
 STANELY (CONT.) It's this thing! 
 DR. NEUMAN (takes the mask) Very interesting... looks like tenth or eleventh century Scandinavian. Where did you get this? 
 (snatches it back) I found it... or it found me. I'm not sure. The problem is it's ruining my life! 
 DR. NEUMAN So you believe this actually changes you into a different person? 
 Yes! (face twitches) It's turning me into some kind of lunatic! (briefly CONTORTS into a Mask expression) 
 DR. NEUMAN Mr. Ipkiss, please. This is just obsessional dellusion. What you have here is nothing more than a piece of wood. 
 DR. NEUMAN My book uses masks as a metaphor for our complex personalities. The masks we must present to the outside world... to suppress the id. To protect our innermost desires. 
 DR. NEUMAN You're going to have to be willing to work on this delusion or... 
 It's not a delusion! Alright, I'll prove it to you if I have to, but I won't be responsible for the consequences. 
 DR. NEUMAN Mr. Ipkiss please! There is no such thing as a magical mask. 
 (holds up mask) Last chance to hide all dangerous objects. 
 DR. NEUMAN Alright then, go on. You're not going to frighten me. 
 Whooooooooaaaaa... 
 DR. NEUMAN Whoa, what? 
 It didn't work? 
 DR. NEUMAN Does that surprise you? The mask is nothing but a reflection of you - the inner you. 
 It worked last night. And the night before. Maybe it only works at night... What kind of mask did you say this was. 
 DR. NEUMAN Scandinavian. It looks like a representation of Loki, the Norse God of Mischief. He supposedly caused so much trouble that Odin banished him from Valhalla forever. 
 
 (GASPS) What if he banished him... into a mask? 
 DR. NEUMAN 
 (SIGHS) I'm sorry, Mr. Ipkiss, we're out of time. 
 But what should I do about my date? 
 DR. NEUMAN Your date? 
 You know. Tonight. The park. Tina. Do I go as myself of the Mask? 
 DR. NEUMAN Mr. Ipkiss, please. Haven't you been listening to anything I've been saying? Go as yourself. And as the Mask. (a beat) Because they are the one and the same, beautiful person 
 LT. KELLAWAY Yeah? 
 (V.O.) I've got that cross-check from the bank files. 
 LT. KELLAWAY And? 
 (V.O.) It's Ipkiss, Alright. Stanley Ipkiss. 
 
 (V.O.) You want us to pick him up? 
 LT. KELLAWAY Don't do a thing until I tell you. Just keep the SWAT team standing by. If this guy's half as bad as he's supposed to be we'll need all the help we can get. 
 LT. KELLAWAY 
 Stanley, what are you doing here? 
 Oh, Tina... Hi. You're early. 
 A little. 
 I just... wanted to make sure you two got together okay. 
 That's nice. (sits down) You know, I hardly ever stop by here. It's hard to believe it was just a garbage heap. 
 (looking at the sky) It's always beautiful at sunset. Those methane emissions really pick up the colors. 
 Wow. They really do. All those pinks and greens. 
 Well... I'm sure my cousin will be along any minute. He never shows up anywhere 'till after sundown. He's sort of strange that way. 
 (RISES) I guess I'll get going. 
 No, Stanley. Stay for a second. I was thinking about what you said and I, uh, I want you to know I appreciate it. Maybe you're right. If I believed in myself a little more I wouldn't rely on guys like Dorian. 
 Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel? 
 Yeah. He's sort of my manager. 
 Tina, you've got to be careful of that guy. He's a dangerous criminal. 
 You really mean that, don't you? 
 Absolutely. You ought to hear the stories... 
 No, I mean, you're really worried about me. That's... real sweet, Stanley. 
 C'mon, Tina this is serious. How involved are you with this guy? 
 I can take care of myself, Stanley. I always have. 
 Oh, really? People close to Tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead, or haven't you noticed? 
 Look, this may sound a little cold but I do what I have to do to get by, okay? I'm nobody in this town without Dorian. 
 And who are you with him Tina? I'm not exactly sure who I am anymore but at least I'm trying to find out. If you really had any faith in yourself, you wouldn't be hanging on to some kind of free ride. 
 STANLEY (CONT.) 
 (SIGHS) I'm sorry Tina. I guess I better get going. 
 
 (RISES) Stanley... wait! 
 This is Kellaway. I need back up and I need it now! Every available man down to Peninsula Park. 
 Looks like it's gonna be a long night. My wife is gonna kill me. 
 What is it, Murray? 
 The cops got your pal Ipkiss staked out at Peninsula Park. We just picked it up over the police band. 
 Let me cover it, Murray! You go on home to Claire. 
 I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey said... 
 (grabs her coat) I'll take care of Ramsey. Thanks a million. I owe you one. 
 he smokes them all down to gray ash. 
 Freeze! 
 KELLAWAY (CONT.) Put your hands up! 
 Alright, alright. Unfreeze! You're under arrest! 
 (TEARS) I was so young! So foolish! So full of life! 
 Sorry, son. That's not my department. Search him! 
 Comb - Flintstones vitamins - Sousaphone - Bazooka - 
 (PAUSE) picture of Kellaway's wife... 
 What the --? 
 (PAUSE) Margaret! 
 You son of a bitch -- ! 
 STANLEY/MASK Jeez, I figured you had a sense of humor! 
 (PAUSE) After all, you married her! 
 Get him! 
'S P.O.V. 
 It's all over! Put your hands over your head or we'll open fire. 
 STANLEY/MASK Hit it! 
 They rave about Sloppy Joe - the Latin lothario - but Havana - has a new sensation. 
 STANLEY/MASK ("Latin" voice) They call me Cuban Pete - I'm King of the Rumba beat - every time I play the maracas I go chick chick chickie boom! 
 Hey, he's not bad. 
 STANLEY/MASK 
 STANLEY/MASK (still singing) Yessir, I'm Cuban Pete! The craze of my native street! When I start to dance everything goes chick chick chickie boom! 
 STANLEY/MASK The senoritas they sing, and how they sling their sombreros --! (It's very nice! So full of 
--) (dip!) And when they're dancing they bring a happy ring to their vaqueros - they sing their song, all the day loonnnggg - 
 You go out there and I'll blow your brains out! 
 line, looking confused. 
 
 KELLAWAY (CONT.) This way! 
 
 
 Halt! Halt or we'll shoot! 
 A 
 A 
 
 Stanley! Get in! 
 Thanks. Where are we going? 
 Someplace where we'll be safe. 
 I saw it. I saw the whole thing. What's happening to you, Stanley? 
 It's crazy... I've lost all control. When I put on this mask I can do anything... be anything, but it's ruining my life. 
 Stanley, I don't know what's happening to you, but I do know this. That letter you sent my column was from a guy with more guts and heart than any of the creeps I've met in Edge City. Whatever this mask is, you don't need it. You... Stanley Ipkiss, are already all you ever need to be. 
 Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean that? 
 
 (PAUSES) Actually... no. 
 What? 
 
 (RISES) What took you guys so long? I've been vamping here for twenty minutes. 
 You have the fifty thou? 
 PEGGY (CONT.) Right. When he puts on the mask he becomes that green thingamajig. 
 (still dumbfounded) Peggy, what are you doing? 
 Sorry, Stanley. You really are a great guy, but I just can't lose my condo. You know how hard it is to find an apartment in this city. 
 My aparment. It's in my apartment! 
 Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt him! 
 I don't know... You just put it on! 
 Better be careful, boss. 
 C.U. DORIAN/MASK 
 Rex's under eyes that glow green with wicked power. His voice is a deep inhuman RUMBLE. 
 Whoa, boss... are you okay? 
 DORIAN/MASK I'm better than ever, you idiot. Now stop the presses. There'll be a new headline tonight. 
 But what about him? 
 DORIAN/MASK DO AS I SAY! I have other plans for Ipkiss. Everything's become so clear to me now! 
 Ah... excuse me. If you don't mind, I'll just take my money and be going. You guys make yourselves at home. 
 DORIAN/MASK Must you go? What a shame. You and I could make beautiful headlines together. 
 Thanks, anyway. That wasn't part of the deal. 
 DORIAN/MASK Of course. You only want what's coming to you, don't you? 
 Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't born yesterday. 
 DORIAN/MASK Ah... But you might die today! 
 What do we do with Ipkiss? 
 DORIAN/MASK The police are looking for the Mask. We shall give them the Mask. And Eddy... 
 Yeah, Dorian? 
 DORIAN/MASK Get the boys ready. The Swedes' expecting us at the casino opening tomorrow night. We wouldn't want to disappoint him, would we? 
 and elbows the other thugs to join in. 
 That money better be where you said it was, Ipkiss or you can Ipkiss your ass goodbye. 
'S P.O.V. 
 
 LT. KELLAWAY I still can't believe it. Hardened cops dancin' in the streets... and broadcast all over the ten o'clock news. 
 The SWAT team got an offer to open for Wayne Newton. 
 LT. KELLAWAY I'm history. The Captain's going to have my badge for breakfast. With a little pension on top. 
 C'mon Lieutenant, it wasn't your fault. Something will turn up. 
 LT. KELLAWAY Sure. Stanley Ipkiss is going to fall right into my lap... 
 LT. KELLAWAY ...Ipkiss! 
 I can explain everything... 
 Don't bother. 
 LT. KELLAWAY You have the right to remain silent, you freakin' Looney Tune. Anymore of your half-baked wisecracks can and will be used against you by me, personally... 
 You've got to listen to me! 
'S P.O.V.: 
 Go find yourself a new home, Milo. It looks like I'm going to be here for a long long time... 
 Wake up. You gotta visitor. 
 About time you found me a lawyer... (a beat) ...Tina? 
 Hello, Stanley. 
 What's wrong? Your boyfriend kick you out for not delivering me on schedule? 
 Is that what you think - that I set you up? 
 I don't know. But I've got plenty of time to figure it out. 
 You're just going to have to trust me on this. 
 Now is not the best time for me on trusting women. 
 I ran out on Dorian last night, Stanley. I just came to tell you I'm sorry. Sorry about everything. 
 You ran out on him? 
 That magic mask of yours turned him into some kind of monster... 
 He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa in the first place. 
 He's going to the casino opening tonight and he's planning to do something terrible. 
 A real change of pace for him. 
 Half this town will be there Stanley. I tried to tell the cops, but they wouldn't listen to me. 
 As long as he's got the mask, there's nothing they can do to stop him anyway. There's nothing anyone can do. 
 There must be some way. How does it work? 
 
 (PAUSES) It's like it brings you innermost desires to life. If deep down inside you're a little repressed and... a hopeless romantic, you become sort of a love-crazy wild man. 
 And if you've got a black heart? 
 Then the world's going to be a very dark place. And if I were you, I'd get out of town. Fast. 
 Thanks. 
 For what? 
 Lots of things. For really believing in me when I couldn't. For sharing a sunset with me. For being the first guy to treat me like I was a person instead of a slab of meat. (a beat) And for being any kind of romantic. Even a hopeless one. 
 (SOFTENING) You're welcome. 
 You know, that night at the club I knew I met someone special. Someone like nobody I'd ever met before. 
 The Mask. 
 No... the guy that was inside the Mask all the time. You. Stanley Ip - 
 TINA (CONT.) --kiss. 
 KEY-GUARD Time's up, lady. 
 I've got to disappear for awhile Stanley. I'm not sure where I'll go but I'll let you know as soon as I can. 
 A 
 (to the Key-Guard) Hey! A girl's being kidnapped out there! Do something! 
 I just went out for a little while Dorian. 
 (CHOKING) No... 
 DORIAN (CONT.) We're going to make a big splash at that opening. One this town will never forget. 
 peers down the hall and sees 
 
 (stage whisper) Milo! 
 Come on, boy! 
 STANLEY (CONT.) Come on, Milo! 
 
 Keys, Milo. Get the keys! 
 Good boy... 
 STANLEY (CONT.) I said "keys" not "cheese"! Keys. K-E-Y-S... keys! 
 
 Atta boy, Milo. Now let's see if we can get out of here. 
 applaudes and flashbulbs POP. 
 DORIAN (CONT.) I wouldn't do that, Sweetie. We don't want to start the celebration early. 
 DORIAN (CONT.) Now sit back and try to relax. I've got to change for the party. 
 
 
 Come on. 
 Ipkiss! 
 Hold it! I warn you! I'm seriously stressed out here! 
 Easy, Ipkiss. Don't be an idiot. You're in the middle of a police station. There's no way you're just going to walk out of here. 
 
 (PAUSES) You're right. 
 Now what are you doing? 
 Putting myself in your custody. 
 You are certifiable. 
 Milo! 
 STANLEY (CONT.) Okay. Now we have to hurry or we'll miss the party. 
 Of course. We wouldn't want to keep Alice and the white rabbit waiting. 
. 
 Now move. 
 CLOSER - LIMO 
 DORIAN/MASK Don't be shy, Tina. I know how you like to make an entrance. 
 DORIAN/MASK And I must say, that's a dress to die for. Or should I say in? 
 Hi Lieutenant. Where are you taking Ipkiss? 
 Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay... ouch! 
 What did you say? 
 DOYLE (CONT.) ...See ya. 
 of the room. The gaming floor is packed with happy PARTY GOERS. 
 Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful. One look at you and I know how your hat feels. 
 MRS. PEENMAN Out of my way, Buster. Mama feels lucky tonight. 
 DORIAN/MASK Now... let the games begin! 
 Ipkiss, I'll have you locked up for this so long sex will be safe again! 
 We scored over half a mil from the safe! 
 DORIAN/MASK You can come out now, Orlando. I think he got the point. 
 Let me go you bastard! 
 DORIAN/MASK What's wrong darling? This is your big production number. You of all people know how important it is to go out with a bang. 
 All set boss. 
 DORIAN/MASK Excellent. The real party starts now and ends in... (sets timer) Thirty minutes. 
 Okay. When I push the red button the safety is off, right? 
 I'm not helping you, Ipkiss. 
 Alright, suit yourself. (to Milo) You stay and be a good boy. 
 Hey, watch it! Oh, Arnie... 
 DORIAN/MASK Swede... my dear, dear business partner. And Mayor Tilton! What a surprise. We have just enough time left to play my favorite game! 
 C.U. - 
'S P.O.V. 
 Whoaaaaa! 
 
 Pssst. You guys. Over here. 
 Stanley! What are you doing here? 
 Start sneaking people out the back. Watch out for the oil. 
 Let me offa this thing, you lousy scumbag! 
 DORIAN/MASK Sorry Swede. I've got an ax to grind with you. In fact I got a couple and I'm afraid they may give you a splitting headache! 
 Stanley! 
 Hang on, Tina. 
 Stanley, look out! 
 C.U. - 
 DORIAN/MASK How touching! The two love birds. Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I'm going to let you spend the rest of your lives together. 
 You've got it all wrong! I could care less about this creep. Nobody could replace you, Dorian. Nobody! 
 DORIAN/MASK If you think a line like that's going to save your life, you're dumber than he is. 
 (SOFTLY) Okay. Maybe it's too late. Then all I want is... a kiss. 
 DORIAN/MASK A kiss? 
 One last kiss. 
 DORIAN/MASK (a beat) Sure, why not... 
 No! From the real Dorian. The guy I used to love. 
 (BREATHY) Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian Tyrel. 
 No time, boss. This building's going down any minute... 
 DORIAN/MASK I make the decisions! And I've decided... 
 
 
 DORIAN (CONT.) Whoa! 
 DORIAN (CONT.) Don't let it get away! 
 
 DOG/MASK 
 Get him off me! 
 C'mon! We've got the money. Let's get the hell out of here! 
 
 DOG/MASK 
 
 (kissing him) You did it... 
 C.U. - 
 Milo! Milo, come! 
 Stanley... we made it. We're alive! 
 Hold it right there or you'll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor. 
 You can have it. But she gets to go. 
 Go where? 
 Swimming. We're still close to shore. 
 Go ahead. Hurry... 
 (sees fire) Stanley! The dynamite! 
 ...Stanley? 
 DORIAN/MASK 
 DORIAN/MASK What a BLAST! This mask makes me a god! 
 Back to jail, Lieutenant? 
 LT. KELLAWAY Ipkiss, I'd like to lock you up for the rest of my life. But the mayor and a hundred other witnesses say Dorian Tyrel's the bad guy and you're the good guy. So no jail. Just a downtown parade at noon. (RESIGNED) And I've got to be your escort. 
 
 Valkyrie change girl. 
 So I deck this thug, grab his gun and tell Stanley, "Take cover, Buddy. I'll get these folks out sae and sound." Y'know we should go back to my place so I can tell you the rest of the story. 
 MRS. PEENMAN Just look at this mess... 
 So what do you say, sweetheart? Let's you and me go back to my place and scramble some eggs. 
 (TERRIFIED) Yah! Put me down! 
 PANS with Mrs. Peenman as she RICOCHETS after him hooting laughter. We ENDFRAME on Stanley and Tina as they watch the

 MR. BURROUGHS (playful) Fix -A-flat? Road flares? Sunblock? Mace? 
 (O.S.) Condoms, handcuffs, lube? 
 Just kidding, Mr. B. Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her. 
 MR. BURROUGHS (sarcastic) Oh, that makes me feel a lot better. 
 MR. BURROUGHS I know, honey. I just -- 
 MR. BURROUGHS Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this... 
 (O.S.) Hello, the guys are waiting! 
 MR. BURROUGHS Buckle up! 
 (O.S.) Watch it! 
 Want me to drive? 
 Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother? 
 Blo w me. 
 
 Pile up!    Pile up! Pile up! 
 Christ, is this tribute to Princess Di Day or what? 
 (laughs) Calm down, Kimmy.   It's not drugs, just weed. 
 Yeah, you should have specified. 
 MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.) Kimberly? It's Dad. 
 MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.) Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid. I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station. 
 MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.) I mean it. Take care of it. 
 Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna call like every ten minutes is he? 
 (hiding bag of weed in pants) Shit! There's a cop behind us. Pull into the right lane now! 
 Look first, idiot! 
 Ignore 'em. 
 
 What the hell?     No,   not you. 
 What's the cop doing?      Did he see that? 
 Forget it, I'll call him myself. 
 I was supposed to be off today. How did I get screwed? 
 (O.S.) No biggie. Drake called in sick. 
 Copy that. (switches off; annoyed) Go on, sleep it off Drake. 
 Relax, dude. 
 Get ready to smile, five guys per girl. 
 What's your problem, ya fuckin' crack baby?! 
 ...couldn't Keep your dick in check for another month? I knew this would happen when I got pregnant. 
 What'd the doctor say? I have to come in to test for STDs? Goddamn 
 Gas it around these idiots. We do have 1200 miles to go, you know. 
 
 Tim, will you cut that out? I can't even hear myself think. 
 
 I know, we'll be there soon. 
 (yells to driver) Ever hear of the Ozone layer, asshole? 
 
 Son of a bitch. 
 A Trans Am. That shit went out with New Kids on the Block. 
 
 (laughs; then) Who? 
 You know, Hasselhoff before he did Baywatch. 
 How does a nice mature fuck sound?

 NORA'S PACER 
 KIMBERLY'S POV 
 (O.S.) Flight 180. You know, that plane crash with those kids from Mount Abraham. 
 Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother? 
 Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimberly. 
 What is it? What are you? 
 That's it. My turn to drive. 
 (O.S.) Flight 180. Y'know, that plane crash with those kids from Mt. Abraham? 
 Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother? 
 Blow me.    Yellow means go, Kimmy. 
 What is it? What are you? 
 That's it. My turn to drive. 
 
 For Christ sakes girl, take a breath. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Five-O's coming!   Let's fucking roll, man! 
 Jesus Christ! Here he comes! Move! 
 I told you she'd ruin everything! 
 Shut up, Dano, just stay cool. (to Kimberly) He's just stoned. 
 What's going on here? 
 Miss, please step out of the vehicle. 
 Excuse me, but is there some way we could just drive around? I have a delivery. 
 Hey hon, you got a mysterious caller on the answering machine from Planned Parenthood. What's going on? 
 
 What on Earth are they doing? 
 (picking up two Naya bottles) Who am I, David Blane? 
 (good-natured laughter) Okay, quit it already. 
 Alright miss, calm down. I just need this lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder! 
 Arrest this whack-job, wouldja? Some of us have lives, y'know. 
 I'm not going to tell you to calm down again -- 
 You couldn't keep your dick in check for a month?! 
 Great, now I'm really gonna be late. 
 L.A. 51, I need assistance and requesting paramedics for a major T.A. At -- 
. 
 Kimberly, what's going on? 
 I don't know what you want from me. Some crazy chic k blocks the highway with her car, said there'd be an accident and there was. Big deal. Even a broken watch is right twice a day... 
 Not to sound insensitive, but how much longer is this going to take? 
 If I don't get back to my classroom soon, the kids'll tear the room apart. 
 Those poor people. To think it would've been us if not for... 
 Tell me again how it started. 
 Do you remember what triggered it all? 
 You knew? You just mean a hunch, right? A bad vibe, maybe? 
 Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette. 
 Like what? 
 You mean Alex Browning. 
 What are you talking about? 
 (sarcastic) 
 Maybe... 
 But this is where it starts to get freaky. So a month goes by, everything seems cool, but then the survivors start dying one boy one. 'Cause when your number's up, it's up, right? Some people said Death itself started coming for them, hunting down every last one, until they were all dead. 
 Well, not quite all of them. Clear Rivers checked herself into a padded room at Stoneybrook. 
 Officer Burke? Could I see you in here? 
 Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again. (beat) Did you? 
 
 Look, you weren't there. It was weird. She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew. (beat) Never mind. 
 I thought we we re finished with this bullshit. This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line. 
 But if I was never meant to pull over, then we all should have died in the pile up. 
 Which means Death could be coming for us. 
 Way to console the witnesses Burke. 
 You got 'em thinking Death is after them? Shit, they're the luckiest sons o' bitches on the planet. Get this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday the kid wins the lotto and today some looney bitch b locks traffic and he avoids the worst pile up in years. I should be so damn unlucky. 
 
 You're all certifiable, you know that? I can't believe I've been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let's go outside. 
 Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'. 
 Look lady, we're just yankin' your chain. 
 Yeah, you're acting like we all just got the Diff'rent Strokes curse or something. 
 What's wrong with you people? 
 MR. BURROUGHS Kimberly... 
 MR. BURROUGHS Can I take her home? 
 Sure, you can all go. 
 First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense. 
 Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season. 
. 
 MR. BURROUGHS What feeling? 
 MR. BURROUGHS Don 't worry. Everything will be fine, you'll see. 
 Motherfucker. 
 E. 
 (O.S.) Dude! You suck! You buy one fucking ticket in your whole life and win twenty grand? We're going whoring in Prague, you know this! (whisper) Hold on, the boss is coming. 
 Damn it! 
 
 Jesus Christ! 
 (as if entranced) Ooooh, I see it now. Your future... A transfer to another department. 
 You've made your point. 
 Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't ne ed you getting freaky on me. 
 What? 
 Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought. 
 No, Mom. Just turn on any station, they've been playing it all day. (beat; rolls her eyes) Yes, Mother. Channel four will do just fine. Here it is, gotta go. 
 (V.O.) Route 18 was backed up for almost nine hours today when a record breaking pile up... 
 (V.O.) ...killed An estimated 18 people. Emergency crews spent hours sifting through the wreckage. 
 (V.O.) ...hoping To recover any survivors from this tragic collision. So far, the police are refusing to release the names of the victims until their families are notified. 
 (O.S.) The camera of a highway patrol car managed to catch this shocking footage -- 
 MR. BURROUGHS My Lord... 
 Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right there? That's my fuckin' car right there! Oh God, that's dope. 
 (O.S.) In other news, a freak accident took the life of a lotto winner. 
 
 Come on, Tim, lights out already. 
 Mom? 
 Yeah? 
 You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what? 
 Oh, please. Some people just need some serious rewiring, that's all. 
 Get some sleep. 
 Officer Burke, please? 
 MR. BURROUGHS I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that you're safe. 
 MR. BURROUGHS You know, after your mother died... 
 MR. BURROUGHS There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day. I can't even tell you some of the 
 MR. BURROUGHS (choking up) I don't know what I'd do if I lost you. 
 
 ...at the request of the patient, you are to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files, pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby pins, no matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles, earrings, chokers, shoelaces... 
 ...paper clips, watches, food, drinks, keys, poisons, pills and medications. (looks at Kimberly) You have a cell phone on you? 
 Then I think we're all done. 
 No honey, but she expects you are. 
 Depends on her, I guess.   She's voluntary. 
 I tried calling last night but your father -- 
 I know. I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight. 
 I didn't. Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors. 
 Did you see that?? 
 I'm not following you -- 
 
 (mischievous smile) You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks. 
 Nice try, kiddo. 
 Mom! 
 You okay? 
 Sure hon. I'm fine.   Let's shake it, we're late. 
 
 . 
 
 Not so much. 
 Hold on. 
 DR. LEES (O.S.) I'm a little disappointed, Tim. Does your mom know you've been smoking? 
 DR. LEES (O.S.) Yeah, that'll have to be filled. 
 DR. LEES Jesus. Every day at the same damn time. Now this'll only sting for a moment. 
 DR. LEES Open big. Wiiiiider... 
 
 DR. LEES How the hell do they expect me to... Would you rather have the laughing gas? 
 DR. LEES Jean?     I need you in here. (waits) Jean??! 
 DR. LEES Open big. Wiiiiiider. 
 DR. LEES Goddamn it already. 
 What are they doing here? And why are they yelling "pigeons"? 
 (shaking his head) Nora's not coming. She refuses to leave her son. 
 (sadly) I did. And right now, I don't think she cares. 
 I am too. But you can use that fear. It'll sharpen your instincts. Keep you alert fro signs. It's the only way you'll be able to sav e the others...and me. 
 I know you didn't ask for any of this, Kimberly. But I don't think you have it in you to quit either. 
 Who is this guy, anyway? 
 Should we knock? 
 Hello, Clear. I've been keeping an eye out for you. 
 Come to... Pick my brain? 
 (to Kimberly) Flesh and bone require 1,600 degrees for cremation. Gold, prosthetics and other metals must be removed before the final -- 
 Fire away. 
 Dead.   But still fresh. 
 For what purpose? You seek a back way out of a room with but one door. You can't cheat Death; there 
 Such fire in you now. People are always most alive just before they die. Don't you think? 
 Some say that there is a balance to everything. An equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the universe. They say that for every lif e there is a death, and for every death a life... 
 Solus novus anima licet evinco mortis; Only new life can defeat death. (off their confusion) The list of life is forever set by the Divine Plan, the guiding hand that plots the course of the universe, down to its tiniest element s. 
 The list accounts for every life; from the dawn of man to the great apocalypse. But the introduction of life that was not meant to be, a soul forbidden to roam the earth, that could invalidate Death's list, shatter its very existence. 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 (with finality) To figure that out you'll have to follow the sign s. 
 But be warned. To disrupt the grand design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe. When you pull all the threads apart, you may find yourself hanging from them. 
 (shakes head; a sick smile) Sorry, time's up. 
 New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy? 
 I'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee yatch. 
 What is it? What did you see? 
: 
 A 
 Remember the onramp? There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van. 
 It sounds all well and good, but 
 (realization) Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident. 
 Hey, I'm a police officer, remember? 
 I, uh...sorry. 
 Taken care of. 
 Got it. 
 Here we go. The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz. And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two. 
 Let's lay this on her gently now. The stress alone could upset the pregnancy. 
: 
 What? 
 I'm Officer Burke.    I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz. 
 Shut up!!! 
 Are you Jorge Cruz? 
 Maybe.   What's this about? 
 May we come in? 
 No.   What's this about? 
 (a little stern) It's about your wife, Isabella. Now is she here? 
 No.   I'm alone. 
 Look, pal, it's probably nothing. But I need to see -- 
 Forget it. You'll need a warrant. I know, I'm a lawyer. 
 Stop!!!   You can't go in there!!! 
 We never meant to hurt you Isa...You're not Isabella! 
 I'm going to sue your ass! 
 Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts this afternoon. Now arrest her! 
 We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going. 
 What was the fight about? 
 Take a guess. 
 Does she have a cell phone?   A way we can contact her? 
 She did. 
 Hey, when you find her, tell her the kid's half mine. 
 Jesus Christ. I wrote to management two weeks ago about these friggin' bumpers. 
 Damn, is that dogshit? 
 Does anybody have a Valium? 
 You'll want to take -- 
 -- half of that. 
 (quietly, into phone) Any word yet on the Dodge van? Damn. 
 So that would mean... I'm next. 
 Nobody's next. This is crazy. First death's stalking us and now premonitions? 
 This can't be happening. My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house... 
 Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live. 
 Why the hell did I ever get on Route 18 in the first place? That's me, Mr. Dumb Fucking Luck. 
 That lucky bastard. 
 Route 18 is Drake's assignment, but he called in sick so I got... (blanches) Drake's never sick. 
 I was my first day of jury duty. 
 Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security numbers. 
 What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago? You're nuts. 
 Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish. 
 Eighteen. And it's "Hebrew". 
 Anyway, I guessed it right and won these. 
 The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18. 
 (realization) Whoa, nine months? 
 Yes, I'd like to report a domestic squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz why, does it matter? I'm at the Super 8 motel. Yes, I own a white van. So what? Just get over here. 
 It's like Forrest Gump. 
 If Death has got such a hard-on for you, maybe you should get the hell away from us. 
 Screw this. I'm going outside for a smoke. 
 You think you should?     It's not safe out there. 
 So? Nora's gotta bite it before me anyway, right? 
 Four years ago my husband died. Now Tim. There's nothing left for me. 
 If it's my time to go, to be in heaven with my family, then I can accept that. 
 If you'll excuse me, I have a funeral to prepare. 
 Yeah, why am I listening to a girl who just got out of the nut house? 
 Whatever. I control my life, not fate. 
 Be careful. And even if you don't believe, give this to Nora. 
 ...man with hooks. I see a man with hooks. Someone?!?! 
 (unsure) I kinda see it, yeah. So...Nora's going to be killed by a man with hooks? 
. 
 Going down, right? 
 Um, by the way, your shoe's untied. 
 Probably for you, anyway. 
 Officer Burke?   I can't hear... 
 What is it? What's wrong? 
 Let me go let me go! 
 Oh, watch it, you've caught your uh... 
 Goodness gracious, darling, let me help you with... 
 You alright, Nora? 
 My God, someone please let me out of this -- 
 ...no escapes my ass. I control my fate. I die on my terms, hear me Reaper cockscuker?! 
 What the hell are you...? 
 Ain't going out like that.   On my terms! 
 Just take it easy! 
 Maybe they were all duds. 
 Six in a row? Never. Impossible. That's like (sinking realization) ...winning the lottery. 
 Can we find the pregnant woman, please? 
 Um, Clear? I'm sorry...about before. I... 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 When I die. Is it gonna hurt? 
 And you're gonna die after me, right? 
 (re: keys and license) Would you take these? And if I die... (tears well up) Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart. 
 A one very pissed off Ms. Isabella Cruz is being detained up in Greenwood. Let's finish this thing. 
 Is this safe, guys? I mean, someone in this car is about to get whacked. Do the rest of us really feel like sitting next to him? (off Kat's glare) Or her. Hopefully her. 
 Guys, let's not panic.   Isabella's safe. 
 You said she was going to drive into a lake. How can she when she's in protective custody? 
 What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane. 
 Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday mor ning. 
 (figures it out) Jorge. When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off. 
 Oh my God. 
 Are you kidding me?!   Oh, man. 
 C'mon.    Let's go. 
 Damn, they always stick me with the clunker. 
 Take my van! 
 Here's what I don't get. For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up... 
 Yeah? 
 But why single me out? What am I in the great scheme of things? You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man. 
 You want weird? Last year, my partner and I were heading out for the graveyard shift. A call comes in about a train wreck and Frank decides to let me handle it alone. 
 I got that beat. So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night. 
 Yeah, so what happened? 
 I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop. 
 Yeah.   How did you know? 
 I'm not sure I-- 
 Shit. The call about the train wreck that saved my life? That was the night I scraped up Billy Hitchcock. 
 Who? 
 Promise me...I won't have the 
 Get around it!!! 
 Remember the theater in Paris that collapsed last year, killed everyone inside? 
 I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign. 
 Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show... 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm not sure I understand. 
 So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be ali ve in the first place. 
 
 Hang on! 
 We're okay, we're okay. 
 Please.   It's not going to wait. 
 I've got to stop and help those people. 
 Do you want to deliver this baby? 
 Not my time.     Amazing... 
 Is everybody alright? 
 He can't breathe!        He can't breathe! 
 MR. GIBBONS (O.S.) Call 9- 1-1! 
 Stop it, don't move him! 
 I can't move my fucking leg! Please get me out of here before it explodes! 
 Watch it, dude! 
 (to Kat, reassuringly) I don't smell any gas. And none's dripping, either. 
 Stop that! I still need this foot, thank you. 
 Sorry.   There's no room. 
 Get that over here!   Move move move! 
 Excuse me, hot soup coming through. 
 CLEAR'S LEG. 
. 
 (O.S.) Rory!!! 
 Where's the cell phone Clear gave you? 
 I dunno. I think I gave it to Eugene back at your place. 
 Damn it. We have to call the Greenwood Police Station and warn Isabella. 
 My legs are starting to cramp up. And God, why am I so thirsty? Does anyone have any Fiji? 
 Christ, you wanna give me a heads up next time, pal? 
 She's at Phelps Memorial. They're prepping her to give birth right now. 
 Where's that? 
 A few miles up the road.   Near the docks. 
 
 Damn, can't you be quieter with that thing? 
 (dripping scorn) Sure, I'll just set it to the "quiet" mode. 
 We gotta go now.   Isabella's in labor. 
 (re: spike behind head) I guess it could be worse. 
 So let's go...Where the hell is Rory?! 
 MR. GIBBONS I didn't mean to do it - I didn't know. 
 MR. GIBBONS (hysterical) Anything you want. Anything.      I wish I knew. I didn't... 
 (buckling up) Hurry up. There's no time.   She's about to give birth. 
 That branch fell and saved my life. You're right, Death's maintaining the order. 
 ...contractions coming quicker now. Take her pressure and CTG. One centimeter dilation. Prep the epidural stat. 
 She's going to have to stop moving if I'm going to -- 
 Goddamn it, keep her still! 
 Sorry, doctor. 
 
 Perfectly still now... 
! 
 Done. (tears welling) Now could someone please find the open window and fucking close it? 
 Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can. 
 Um, Kimberly? This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down. 
 I wasn't worried about us. 
 
 
 (O.S.) Kimberly! Slow down! 
 Kalarjian? 
 
 Quite complaining. I got burnt babies in the Children's Ward braver than you. 
 Don't bother. You won't be talking for at least a month. Think you can handle that, Jabberjaw? 
 Don't worry. Everyone learns to love me once they get used to my sense of humor, okay? 
 No time. Keep going. I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway. 
 
 (O.S.) ...ironically impaled through the head as a result of an emergency airbag deploying. 
 (O.S.) ...police Have speculated that one of the deaths may have been 
 Good advice, Sue. And stay in school. Up next, Johnny Showers has the weather... 
 What are you doing? The Henzels are still waiting for you in the Children's Ward -- 
 And Mrs. Dempsey in hydrotherapy can't feel her legs. 
 ROUTE 18 TRAGEDY 
 ANCHOR    WOMAN (O.S.) Mor e tears were    shed this morning in the wake of     yesterday's tragedy that rocked the     Tri -State area... 
 I'm sorry, I can't give out that info unless you're a relative. 
 I'll have to see your ID, Ms. Cruz. 
 Hurry, I think she's this way. 
 Security? 
 What's wrong? IS the baby all right? 
 Maybe I should step outside. 
 Code Blue in Delivery Room 6.   Code Blue! 
 Just where do you think you're going? 
 What are you doing in here?    Get the hell out! Right now! 
 Don't sweat it.   It's over. 
 
 (O.S.) Kimberly! Are you okay?! 
 Are you okay? You just face planted! 
 But it's over. Isabella's baby was the key. You saw her die and everything, right? 
 Impossible. She was on the onramp. 
 Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean? 
 
 EUGENE'S ROOM 
!!! 
 DR. KALARJIAN Doctor Kalarjian. Excuse me, please. 
 What? 
 That's crazy. You can't give up now. We can still fight this thing. 
 
 What the fuck?! 
 
. 
 DR. KALARJIAN (O.S.) Ready and...CLEAR! 
 KIMBERLY'S POV 
 She's back! 
 DR. KALARJIAN Five CC's of narcodon. I want her stabilized and prepped for ICU. 
 
 Kimberly?! 
 I know.   I can feel it too. 
 
 
 MR. BURROUGHS (O.S.) So what's the deal, Thomas? Three months and you still haven't asked my daughter out on a date. 
 What's wrong with a platonic relationship? 
 MR. GIBBONS Platonic my ass. That's for ugly women. 
 (smiling) Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment. 
 MR. GIBBONS Oh please. I'm not hurting anyone. (looking around, lowering voice) Besides, if you can beat Death, 
 MR. GIBBONS You know, you still never explained to us how you did it. 
 Well, technically when we died, we gave Death what it wanted. And by the time we were revived, it had already moved on to graver pastures. 
 MRS. GIBBONS You know, I'm having the greatest day? 
 MRS. GIBBONS Our...pleasure. So, ready for the back-to -school season? NYU, right? 
 MRS. GIBBONS Sounds wonderful. I wish I were going myself. 
 MR. GIBBONS (to Mr. Burroughs) You may want to think twice about letting her live in the village, Bob. Our eldest daughter moved there and came back with piercings all over her face. (looks grave) Among other places. 
 (O.S.) Dad used to call her the pincushion. From Hellraiser. 
 Dad, you had the spatula last, right? 
 MR. GIBBONS Sure, here. 
 MR. GIBBONS Sure does. Owes it to that friend of yours, in a way. 
 MR. GIBBONS Well, Brian was nearly hit by an ambulance the day...but your friend Rory pulled him back at the last second. 
 MRS. GIBBONS

 
 
 C'mon, Robin. 
 
 He's got a meeting at the high school. We're supposed to walk home with Kim... (sees Robin watching the young couple) She's too busy. Let's go by ourselves. 
 N-n-n-no, Alex. Let's w-w-wait. 
 Why? Robin is staring at Nick. Alex looks, understands. He's angry. 
 
 Okay, let's go. The sisters start to walk across the lawn. 
 Y-you 1-1-like him? 
 Who? 
 
 (SMILES SHYLY) Y-you know. 
 Nick? Oh, he's all right, I guess. They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at her big sister. 
 
 Robin? Robin smiles and takes Kim's hand. They walk along the road, kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags. Sud- denly Kim halts. 
 
 
 
 (CALLS OUT) Alex? The VOICES continue. Robin moves closer, peering through the tall bushes surrounding the lot. She sees Nick playing in.the framework with three of his classmates. Robin recognizes JUDE CUNNINGHAM, and KELLY LYNCH as Kim's two best friends. The fourth child, WENDY RICHARDS, is a dark-haired girl, domin- eering and loud. As Robin watches, Wendy jumps up onto the floor of the building. 
 I want to play 'Murder.' Who's the killer? 
 You, Wendy! 
 
 
 The killer is coming for you! He moves into the building, chanting "Kill, kill.," in a low monotone. As he disappears from view, Robin cau- tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the building. 
 (O.S. The killer strikes! 
 
 
 
 
 Killers, here! Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away. 
 N-n-n-no! 
 
 
 Are you crazy? They'll put us in jail! Confused, Nick cannot reply. The other girls grow silent. 
 
 
 WENDY (C ONT D ) We'll go home now and never ever tell anyone. They'll think it was an accident. 1,10 one but us will ever know. She looks at each of them. They are still too numb to respond. 
 
 
 
 Kelly? Kelly looks from Wendy to the mangled body and begins to whimper. 
 
 (WHISPERS) I don't wanta go to jail... 
 Swear! 
 
 
) Good. 
 HA:MMIOND No! 
 
 (angrily, 
 ` 0 N D 
 SUPER: APRIL 27, 1980. A young woman with long, golden brown hair and a trim figure is slipping into a pair of tight jeans. Pull- ing on a halter top, she sways to the MUSIC. 
 (CALLS OUT) Kim! Turn that music down. You're driving me crazy! Turning around at the SOUND of her mother's VOICE, Kim Hammond reaches for the volume control Now eighteen, she is a strikingly beautiful girl with an open, innocent quality. 
 
 (CALLS OUT) Okay, Mom! Kim quickly finishes dressing, whirling around the room to the pounding disco rhythm. Giving her hair a few final strokes with a brush, she gazes at a photograph of a young man stuck in her mirror. On the picture is written: "To Kim, the best on the floor... dancing, that is! Love, Nick." Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror. This one shows her sister, Robin, taken a few days be- fore the accident. Her sadness passes as quickly as it came. Gathering her textbooks, she switches OFF the RADIO and exits. 
 (reading the paper) I'll tell you, Vi, I'm thinking of starting up an armed robbery course at the high school.. I've got a feeling it'd be popular... He smiles at his joke, looks at her. She doesn't seem to have heard him. 
 
 
 (LAUGHS) Mmmm, sounds like fun! 
 
 Scared tiff. She leans over to kiss her mother. Vivian automatical- ly turns her cheek to Kim without looking at her. 
 
) No, dear. Fix yourself a good meal. You're getting awfully thin. Kim and her father exchange glances. He shrugs 
 who's your lucky escort tonight? 
 You know, Daddy... Nick. 
 HAM`IOND 
 (NODS) I've been trying to forget. The boy's too sure of himself. 
 
 (INTERRUPTS) Mom, tell him... 
 HAMÏ¿½TOND (affects a casual 
) Vi, I made you an appointment with Dr. Fairchild. Vivian finally looks up at him. 
 
 
 (UPSET) It doesn't help. You know that! 
 Now, Vi... Vivian stumbles to her feet and rushes out of the kitch- en before he can finish. With a glance at Kim, Hammond hurries after his wife. Going out through the swinging door, he bumps into a young man just entering. 
 HAM4OND 
 Have you got a date for tonight? His mouth crammed.full of Twinkie, Alex mumbles his reply. 
 
 C'mon, Kimbo, I may be hard up... 
 Alex! Jude's cute... Besides, she's funny and really smart. Give you somebody to do equations with! 
 
 Not bad but it's not romance. 
 It'll do for tonight. Kim shoots him a look, then backs off. 
 If you get a chance, dance with Jude once or twice, okay? 
 Sure. He returns her glass of milk, empty. 
 
 Trust me. Vivian does not move. Finally, after a long pause, she turns toward her husband. Her eyes filled with tears, she nods. 
 I'll just be a minute... Vivian is already reaching for the door handle, 
 See you later,'Mom. Vivian gives her a thin smile. Hammond takes her arm and leads her into the imposing building. 
 Could I have one of those? My nerves are shot this morning. With a terrified glance back at the woman, Vivian rushes out of the elevator. Hammond follows. 
 HAI` IOND 
 (CALLS OUT) Dr. Fairchild! DR. RUPERT FAIRCHILD straightens up and turns around. He's a. portly man in his fifties, trying to disguise his girth with careful tailoring. 
 We appreciate your seeing... us. I know how busy you must be. Vivian is staring at a painting of a young girl playing with a kitten. Catching Fairchild's eye, Hammond nods toward the outer door. Vivian does not notice the gesture. 
 Have a seat, Vivian. I'll be right in. She slowly crosses the room, turning suddenly in the doorway. 
 I won't forget. Vivian looks from Hammond to Fairchild, who smiles. She enters the office, leaving the door open. Hammond shakes hands with Fairchild, and for Vivian's benefit adds... HAï¿½I`i IOND 
 H.ANMOND She's at it again. 
 
 (NODS) Today's the date? 
 Seven years ago today Robin was killed. Fairchild looks up from filling his container with water. 
 HA,E,10ND 
 Pardon? 
 Tonight's the Junior-Senior Prom at our high school. Robin would have been sixteen, She and Alex. 
 The twins... How is Alex? 
 Fine. I just thank God he was too young to really understand what happened to his sister. 
 And your older daughter? 
 
 (SMILES) Kimmy's my princess. Sometimes she'll get depressed for a while... but it never lasts long. Young people seem so much more... resilient. They walk back to the office. 
 (looking up at Hammond) And yourself? No scars? 
 (after a pause) I've learned to live them.. Vivian seems worse this time. 
 
 (NODS) The persistence of Vivian's trauma. I wonder if there isn't something more serious at work here? 
 Something more serious than her daughter's death? 
 
 (SCREAMS) Daddy! Hammond slams on the brakes, throwing Alex against the dashboard. 
 You all right? They both nod. Alex massages his wrist. Hammond slips the car into gear and cautiously continues driving. 
 You're worried about Mom? 
 I was... He is interrupted by DISCO MUSIC ON the RADIO. Play- ing with the tuning dial, Alex quickly tries to pass over the music. 
 Hey, keep that! Alex groans but does as she asks. 
 Disco sucks! 
 
 Sorry, Dad... (turns back to 
) Disco bites it! 
 
 (DRYLY) That's much better. The car pulls into the Winston High School parking lot. They pile out. 
 Good morning, Mr. Sykes. SANFORD SYKES, the newly-hired custodian, bares his yellow teeth in a crooked grin and waves the whirring blades in salute. Kim shudders and stays close to her father as they walk on. 
 He's creepy. 
 I heard he's wacko. 
 The man is not... wacko. 
 Kelly says he's a pervert, spying on the girls undressing in the locker room. 
 Sykes may have some problems, but he's no Peeping Tom. He's been thoroughly checked out. 
 
 I'.ve got to decide on my hair style for tonight. 
 
 (WRYLY) Wonderful. Alex? 
 I'm building an atomic bomb in shop. Smiling, he moves inside. Hammond shakes his head and hurries off. 
 Who are you? 
 
 
 
 
 HAM 0ND (taking her hand) What happened? 
 WOMAN (ADELE) Well you see, Mr. Hammond, the, air conditioner fan was set for high but... 
 HAP-MOND 
 (INTERRUPTS) Please, Miss... Adele, 
 
 (INTERRUPTS) Cooper... Ms. Cooper. 
 Whatever! I have some important calls to make. Please see that I'm not disturbed... (wades through the papers to his inner 
) , and put all this back where it belongs! He enters his office. 
 
 W-Wendy? T-t-tonight it's m-m-my t-turn! Wendy's shock quickly turns to anger. 
 Screw you, Lou! Wendy slams the receiver into its cradle. Grabbing her books, she storms out of her bedroom. 
 You be home for dinner, Wendy? Wendy angrily grabs her sweater from the woman. 
 How the hell do I know? She exits. 
 K-K-Kelly? T-tonight it's m-m-ï¿½IZ Horrified, Kelly drops the phone. The DOORBELL RINGS. Frightened, she gasps, hugging the wall. The DOORBELL RINGS again. Very slowly she moves out of the kitchen. 
 (O.S.) Christ, Kelly, c'mon! We're late! Relief floods across her face. Kelly quickly unfastens the latch. 
 (holding her tightly) I'm glad to see you, too. 
 Nightmare? 
 
 
 (INTERRUPTS) Turned you on did he? Maybe I should try that! She breaks from his grasp. 
 So am I.,. 
 We'll get there... eventually. 
 Hell, you should be glad. A lot of girls would love to have someone steady like me. His irrepressible right hand starts up her leg. 
 (MOCK-SWEETLY) Steady? You mean persistent, don't you, darling? Grabbing his hand, she holds it firmly in her lap, which doesn't bother Drew at all. 
 J-Jude? T-t-tonight it's my-my t-t-turn! A disappointed Jude slowly replaces the receiver. Mrs. Cunningham looks on sympathetically. Still no date? 
 (shakes her head) Getting closer, though. 
 MRS. CUNNINGHAM A boy? 
 
 (SMILES) An obscene call... and not very obscene at that! Mrs. Cunningham starts to say something. 
 
 Hey, beautiful, need a lift? Jude continues walking, the van moving slowly alongside her. 
 No thanks. 
 C'mon, I won't bite. Jude chomps down hard on her apple. 
 So who are you? TheGuy leans further out the window. 
 Seymour Stone but.. He's cut short as the van bounces up onto the sidewalk. Jude shrieks. The flustered boy steers the van quickly back onto the road. 
 
 I can see why... How old are you, Slick? 
 GUY (SLICK) Old enough... 
 I've heard about guys like you... running over girls on the sidewalk... 
 Just some girls... If they're good lookin' I give 'em a ride. 
 
 
 
 (NODS) Straight to Winston. She climbs inside. 
 Looks like a cheap motel. 
 Cheap?... that's a two hundred dollar waterbed there... Jude turns around for a look. 
 
 You think this is the time to study? She grabs the book, gives it to him. He places it on the fold-down table between them, flips it open. The inside is hollowed out into a container. It contains nearly a hundred neatly rolled joints. 
 Straight to Winston High? 
 
 You won't believe it... 
 (PAUSES FOR 
) Sixteen! 
 
 You going to the prom tonight? Jude looks away, embarrassed. 
 Sure, of course. 
 
 (GLUMLY) Not me. My date got sick. 
. 
 
 (BRIGHTENING) Yeah? Well, as a matter of fact.. 
 
 So I guess we're both maybe not going... 
 Yeah... too bad... He looks at her. 
 
 I'd love to! She kisses him on the cheek. 
 
 
 (CALLS OUT) What's your name? 
 Let's go, son! A handsome dark-haired boy of eighteen emerges from a back room. He's Nick McBride. His father pulls open the front door. 
 
 Right, I know... McBride steps out into the hallway. Nick grabs his books and follows. The TELEPHONE RINGS. Nick hesi- tates. Shaking his head he exits, shutting the door. 
 Why didn't you answer i 
 It's just Wendy. She's pissed off. She wants me to take her to the prom tonight. 
 I thought you two broke up. The TELEPHONE continues to RING. 
 Three months ago... you can't tell Wendy anything she doesn't want to hear. 
 Aren't you going with the Hammond girl? The principal's daughter? 
 
 (SMILES) Kim. 
 God, I wish I had your women problems. They walk down the corridor as the TELEPHONE continues to RING. 
 Hello... what?... He listens, expressionless, then hangs up. He flips a switch on the console and the MUSIC STOPS. He sits there a moment, thinking. Then he turns out the lights and exits. 
 S-s-sorry, Missy. You hurt? Her heart pounding wildly, Kim rushes into the gym. Sykes picks up his mop. 
." Gazing around, Kim feels the excitement of anticipation. Imagining herself in Nick's arms, she begins to dance, whirling through the gym to the music in her head. Suddenly, someone is clapping, slowly. 
 (O.S.) Bravo... Kim stops abruptly. Standing onstage, watching her, is Wendy. 
 
 Yes, as a matter of fact... I was just... 
 Thinking about Nick, maybe? 
 That's my business. 
 You wish! Nick is King of the Prom, you happen to be Queen of the Prom... that's all there is to it, Hammond... As far as anything else... Nick is mine... 
 You really ought to tell him that. 
 I'm telling you, okay? Stay away from Nick! 
 You and Nick haven't been together in ages. 
 You know nothing about it! 
 Really? So who are you going with tonight? 
 It's not who you go with, honey... it's who takes you home. 
 I'll try and remember that. 
 Wait and see, bitch... Just wait and see... 
 : So then she threatened me. 
 Wendy's a jerk! 
 (V.0.) She didn't! 
 (V.0.) Swear to God! 
 (V.0.) 
 Dual headers... thinks he's a fox... Dust'll run you... long and slinky and tight... swings like my mother... how much for half a lid? Jude joins Kim and Vicki as they walk. 
 guys. 
 Jude. 
 Missed you on the bus today. 
 I didn't ride it. 
 I thought you were too big to hide. 
 
 
 (IGNORING VICKI) I got a ride. 
 Who with? 
 None of your business. 
 
 (BLASE) A guy. Vicki and Kim are left hanging, waiting for more. 
 
 
 (EXPLODES) I'm going to the prom! Kim. and Vicki excitedly hug Jude. A big, bushy-haired youth with a stubble of beard strolls by, smirking when he sees the girls embracing. LOU PERANO, a twenty-year- old high school junior, stops and stares. 
 I knew there was some reason Kim wouldn't go out with me. She likes girls! The girls separate. 
 Say goodbye, Lou. 
 (to Vicki and Jude) Let's go. They head down the hallway to their lockers. Lou tags along. 
 You girls get bored with each other, I'm always around, you know? They pass Kelly and Drew huddled at her locker. His hands rest on her shoulders. They are talking intently. 
 Poor girl must be exhausted. Look how he has to hold her up... (sees Nick approaching 
) Uh oh. Kim stops suddenly and turns to look. Lou bumps into her, his hand purposely grazing her rear. 
 Go play with yourself, Lou. 
 I'm saving it for you. Kim sighs with disgust and turns around as Nick walks up talking to Wendy. 
 Wendy, for Christ sake, I never... 
 (SEES KIM) Kim! 
 
 (IGNORING WENDY) Hello, Nick. Seeing Kim, Wendy quickly reaches up and kisses Nick on the mouth. 
 We'll talk about it later, lover. Bye. Wendy smiles and strolls away. Lou follows her. 
 
 
 (NODS) Worked real well. The BELL RINGS signalling first period class. Kim turns to Vicki and Jude. 
 
 
 
 Shhh! 
 Oh no you don't... (turns back and calls to Nick) She's smiling, Nick. Big grin spread all over her face. Kim punches her friend but the damage is done. Nick grins broadly. Blushing, Kim turns back, flashes him a quick smile and disappears around a corner to the hoots of Vicki and Jude. 
 You wanta take care of yourself, man... Kim's expecting a lot from you tonight... Nick laughs. 
 (O.S.) Who's there? Hammond, shaken, looks across to the far wing. There's an elevated platform where the electronic control panel is located. Alex peers down. 
 Alex?... What the hell're you doing? 
 I'm testing the board... I didn't hear you... nobody's supposed to be here yet... 
 No, well'... He looks around. He's still trying to get himself together. 
 
 HA, MOND 
 Miss Hammond! Wide-eyed, Kim desperately tries to crush the note in her hand. 
 
 (barely a whisper) Read the note? 
 
 Yessir... (clears her throat) Well, it's mostly talking about... 
 
 (INTERRUPTS) Word for word, please. Exactly as it is written. 
 
 (NODS) Right.. (coughs and finally begins, slowly, in a 
) What a hunk! Titters from the class. 
 
 The class roars with laughter. 
 
 KIM (CONS'' D) (reading ahead, 
) and his name is Slick! The classroom erupts into laughter as the BELL RINGS, signaling the end of the class. Still laughing, stu- dents gather their books and shuffle out, several giv- ing Kim sympathetic glances as they pass. 
 After school, Miss Hammond. One hour detention study hall... you and your friends! Kim looks from Jude to Vicki. 
 But, Mr. Weller, tonight's the prom... 
 
 (SNIFFS) hunk! He spins on his heel and marches back to his desk. The three girls hurriedly exit. 
 
 (NUDGING JUDE) Here comes the incredible hunk himself. Jude looks up to see Slick slowly making his way down the line towards them. He is carrying a tray piled high with snack food: potato chips, cookies, candy. Jude smiles as he passes her, grinning. 
 Looks like a party. 
 Yeah -- I don't think he's gonna be too good for my diet... Slick moves down the lunch line. Suddenly he is bumped from behind, sending the tray and the snacks flying across the room. Looking around, Slick jumps back, startled by a tall figure wearing a dark ski mask. 
 
 Say what? 
 
 (SHRUGS) Forget it, Lou. 
 
 (SMIRKS) That's what I figured. Slick bends over to pick up his lunch. 
 
 (muffled by the mask) Like me better now? 
 It's an improvement! She turns her back to him. 
 You like it so much... (spins her around to 
) Have a taste. He kisses her hard on the mouth. Swinging at him, Kim breaks away. Laughing, Lou grabs her wrists and rough- ly pulls her to him. Alex instantly jumps to his feet. 
 
 This time you're out, Perano. Lou points to Alex who is being helped up from the floor. 
 He started i 
 I'll bet... Alex? 
 That's not true! Alex was trying to help me. The teacher looks from Kim to Lou to Alex. 
 You'd better come along to your father's office. 
 
 (SNEERS) Wonder who'll get off with just a warning? Several students laugh. The two Teachers march Lou and Alex through the silent cafeteria. Lou swaggers bask- ing in the attention. Alex walks with his head bowed. They exit. 
 I don't care who. Just somebody else! 
 
 (BITTER) You never had it so good as with me. 
 I've got it now... better! 
 
) Lou! The surprised Lou tries to stop but the Teachers hurry him and Alex past the couple. Wendy watches Nick. 
 (turning back to Wendy) I got this appointment. 
 
 I'LL WAI Wendy turns to see Nick's reaction but he is already walking towards the cafeteria. The irate girl glares after him. 
 
 
 
 Can't it wait? 
 I didn't ask... But one looks a little like that child in the picture on your desk. Hammond automatically glances at the photograph of Robin framed alongside one of the rest of his family. 
 (into the receiver) I've got to go now, Vi... We'll be there within the hour... There's a loud CLICK on the other end of the line. 
 
 
 
 
 (NODS) Brawling in the cafeteria... both of them. He places Lou's ski mask on Hammond's desk. The prin- cipal glances at it. 
 
 
 
 I was just foolin' around with this girl... 
 
 (INTERRUPTS) Kim! Hammond frowns. 
 when this -- your son tackled me and... 
 
 (INTERRUPTS) Is this true, Alex? 
 
 (SNIDE) I knew It ! Hammond whirls on him. 
 You knew what? 
 It just figures. 
 (his voice rising 
) That I'll play favorites? That I'll go easy on Alex because he's my son? (pauses, waiting for Lou to back down and 
 (RECOVERS SOMEWHAT) You're suspended -- indefinitely! Now get out! 
 
 (SNEERS) What about your son? 
 
 See you around. He exits, slamming the door. 
 
 Watch for me, little girl. You know I'm just a kiss away. Lou laughs and walks off toward the parking lot. Kim shudders. Wendy's white Mustang slides up to the curb. The pass- enger window rolls down and Lou leans over to look in- side. After a moment he climbs in and the MUSTANG PEELS out of the lot, leaving twin black tread marks in its wake. 
 What a pair! 
 Made for each other! Kim opens a carton of yogurt. 
 You wearing that green gown tonight? 
 You kidding? That was last year. This year... red silk! (smiles and runs her hand from her neck to her waist) Cut to here! ... 
 (O.S.) Cut to where? Kim and Vicki turn to see Nick ambling across the lawn toward them. 
 
 (MOCK-SEDUCTIVELY) Anywhere you like... 
 
 CAR-HOP Ready to order? 
 
 I'm uh... a little short on cash.. 
 You can owe me. 
 Yeah? Okay then, a couple of burgers, a large fries... what kind of beer you got? 
 CAR- HOP C'mon man, this is a drive-in not a bar. 
 All right, all right... don't get nervous... Gimme a coke... 
 LOU (CONT'D) (nods to Wendy) She'll have the same. 
 A small diet cola. 
 That ' sit. The Car-hop shrugs, wheels away. Wendy turns to Lou. 
 I'll buy you one for Christmas, all right? Now, how do I know you're serious? 
 Whatta you mean, serious? I hate that school, Hammond and his asshole family... 
 I don't want anyone hurt... not badly. 
 You got it... anything your little heart desires... 
 Lou, shouldn't we go over this. Lou puts his finger to her mouth, silencing her. 
 I'll take care of it, Scout's honor... Don't worry about it... 
 
 Don't worry about it.. She unbuttons his shirt and begins to kiss and lick his chest. Slowly she works her way down. Lou begins to writhe. Wendy's head disappears from VIEW. Lou's eyes snap open in surprise. Wendy groans. 
 Y Damn stick shift! Lou starts to protest, then dissolves. 
 CAR-HOP Enjoy your meal. 
 I am excited, it's just... in some ways it's such an awful day... It's Robin's day... 
 My mother's all upset, as usual. My father too... he doesn't show it so much... It's hard to get over something like that. Robin would have been a junior, like Alex. This would've been her first prom... I guess that's'why it seems so much worse this year... She stops, turns and faces Nick. It's hard for him to meet her gaze. 
 
 I love you too. 
 I'm... I want you to know that... Robin's death... I remember it and I've always been... so sorry about it... Kim looks puzzled. 
 
 That's my father... I've got to go, Okay? 
 Yeah... I'll see you later. She hesitates a moment, then kisses him quickly, turns and goes. Nick looks shaken up. He stares after her as she hurries away. Behind Nick, in the other corner of the parking lot, a metal door slides open, loud RAUNCHY ROCK and ROLL sud- denly infests the air. Nick turns, sees Jude climbing out of Slick's van. Jude looks about as stoned as she can get. She spots Nick, waves. 
 Hey, Nick! Nick turns and heads the other way. 
 HP`ï¿½MOND (0. S. We have to go, Vi. 
 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 (SOUTHERN ACCENT) No, no, Miss Cantrell! Never bend from the waist... Squat! 
 (DEMONSTRATES) Always squat to retrieve. Otherwise, you look like the broad side of a barn! (glares at Sykes) Isn't that so, Mr. Sykes? Embarrassed, the custodian scuttles away to the girls' Laughter. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 
 Shhh! Kelly takes Jude aside as Kim and Vicki approach Henri Anne. 
 
) You sure she likes Weller? 
 Positive. I heard her say she's had the hots for him since they met! 
 She said that? 
 Well, not exactly. 
 HENRI-ANNE Oh, Kim. You'll be in the gym promptly at three-fifteen for rehearsal? 
 Well, actually no, Miss Benton. can't make it... You know Mr. Weller? 
 HENRI-ANNE We're... acquainted. 
 He.. umm.. 
 
 (BLURTS OUT) He's got a crush on Kim! 
 HENRI --ANNE (staring at Kim) He has what? Kim, wide-eyed, can only look at Vicki. 
 He keeps making Kim stay after school in detention study hall for no reason... Just so he can be near her. 
 HENRI-ANNE That's horrible! Kim gulps. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
) So you have detention this afternoon? Kim nods meekly. Lost in thought, Henri-Anne fondles a tennis ball, a curious smile playing across her face. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 
 Mr. Sykes! 
 Vicki, don't... 
 Oh, Mr. Sykes... Sykes stops, turns around. 
 
 
 (LAUGHS) Vicki's sex life is more talk than action. Besides, Drew wants you. 
 
 (SHRUGS) Let him. 
 See you outside, Wendy. 
 Just be a minute... Kim and Kelly hang up their towels and step into the showers. 
 What about us? Wendy finishes brushing her hair, shoots Kim.a dark look, exits. 
 Maybe I asked him... Kelly looks at her friend. 
 I'll be right there, Melanie. No answer. Curious, Wendy moves around the lockers, investigating. The room appears empty. There's a sudden LOUD CREAKING. Wendy whirls around. A locker door is swinging slowly open. 
 
 
 Let him? She looks at Kelly. Neither girl hears the SQUISH of RUBBER SOLES moving across the wet tile floor. Suddenly there are LOUD VOICES. Melanie comes through from the locker room, laughing. Behind her, Wendy's ANGRY WORDS are AUDIBLE. 
 (O.S.) If you ever try anything like that again, you cow! Melanie thinks it's hilarious. 
 (to Kim and Kelly) You should've seen her jump... Nadia Comenici never did better... Wendy storms in. She's got the photo in her hand. She waves it at Kim and Kelly. 
 What's this supposed to mean? 
 
 I didn't! She turns, glares at Melanie. 
 Don't look at me... 
 You're all... children... She storms out. Melanie looks at Kim and Kelly, shrugs, follows Wendy. A DOOR SLAMS in the locker room. Kim and Kelly look at each other, laugh, turn their faces back to the steaming water. Neither one hears the SOUND across the room, a HARSH RHYTHMIC HEAVY 
. Kelly bends her head away from the water, clears her eyes., She squints out through the steam at the big wall mirror across the room. She sees something. She steps back into Kim, her eyes wide with fear. 
 Watch it... Kelly covers her breasts with her arms, presses against the wall, terrified. Suddenly there's an EXPLOSION of SOUND. Kim screams, jumps back, stares. There's a jagged hole in the cen- ter of the mirror, huge cracks radiating from it, spidering across its surface. For a moment no one moves. Splinters of GLASS TRICKLE down to the floor. There's no other sound. Kim grabs for her towel, steps out of the shower, looks. There's no one. She heads for the locker room door. Kelly runs after her. 
 1 
 What did you see? Kelly just shakes her head. 
. 
 I'd like to see my f ather . 
 Another Hammond? 
 
 No, he's not. He said he'd be back but... She trails off. Kim is obviously upset. 
 
 Oh... There was... Somebody broke a mirror in the shower room... There was somebody in there... 
 A mirror? Seven years bad luck... She tries to smile. Kim just looks at her. 
 (O.S.) Did it work? Kim is startled, turns. Vicki and Jude and approach- ing. Vicki hurries to the door, reads the note. 
 
 HENRI-ANNE Careful, Monty... A little higher... (sees Kim and 
) I'm glad you could make it! 
 Something came up... (looks at Weller) 'Afternoon, Mr. Weller. 
 
 HENRI-ANNE Let's get started. 
 (CALLS OUT) Nick! Nick pokes his head out of the sound booth set on a platform near the stage. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 All set, Miss Benton. Just have Davy roll the tapes. 
 HENRI -ANNE Wonderful. You can be Mr. Hanunond for the rehearsal! Alex groans. Kim smiles as Nick joins her. She takes his hand, clutches it. They start to walk away, talk- ing quietly. Nick puts his arm around her. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 HENRI -ANNE You'll wait here... (looks around for 
) Nick? Nick silently creeps from behind a partition and moves up directly behind Henri-Anne. He mimes choking her, a crazed expression on his face. Kim has to laugh at his clowning. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 CONTINUING; WHIRLS 
 
 (GRINS) Scary place! 
 HENRI-ANNE You have to stand up here tonight, not me. If you don't know what to do, you'll look the fool! Nick glances at Kim. She shrugs. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 (CONTINUIN 
 HENRI-ANNE (continuing; calls out) Can you hear me, Kim? 
 
) Yes. Kim leans against a wall, gazing around at her gloomy surroundings. She does not hear the WHISPERED CONVER- SATION coming from behind a nearby partition. She does not see Wendy and Lou lurking there, watching her. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 VOICE (TAPED) The King and Queen of the George Winston High School Junion-Senior Prom for 1980 -- Nick McBride and Kim Hammond! They meet backstage center and turn towards the parting curtain. Henri-Anne stands at the front of the stage, her hand resting on Alex's shoulder, as Kim and Nick proceed downstage. 
 VOICE (TAPED) 
 (to Kim as they 
) Bullshit! Kim smiles. Peeking out from behind the curtain, Wendy turns to Lou. 
 
 
 (GRINS) Shhh! 
 VOICE (TAPED) Nick is a three-sport letterman and president of the Key Club. He plans to attend State University in the fall. 
 Because he can't get in anywhere else! 
 VOICE (TAPED) Kim is the head cheerleader and ranked number one on the girls' tennis team. She hopes to become a teacher. 
 If she ever graduates... Nick and Kim stop downstage center. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 (SHOVING ALEX 
 HENRI -ANNE 
 My sister? 
 HENRI-ANNE Alex! Alex awkwardly kisses Kim on the cheek. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 Kiss the king? 
 On the mouth! Kim laughs at Alex's discomfort. 
 HENRI-ANNE Shake hands... They shake. 
 HENRI -ANNE 
 HENRI -ANNE 
) Where are the steps? Silence. 
 HENRI-ANNE (continuing; to the 
) You expect our king and queen to jump to the floor? A STUDENT in the back timidly responds. 
 I'll find them, Miss Benton. Henri-Anne turns back to Nick and Kim. 
 HENRI-ANNE You'll descend the steps... Nick and Kim climb down from the stage. 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 HENRI-ANNE 
 (SIGHS) It'll be beautiful! 
 Hello? Adele twists her head around to look at Kim. Her "Rainbow" collapses. Spinning around, Adele sits cross-legged on the floor and smiles at Kim. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah... I've calmed down a bit... 
 This works for me. 
 Has my father been back? 
 Nope. Haven't seen him all afternoon. 
 And he didn't leave a message? 
 Not a word. 
 
 Let me finish and I'll give you a lift. 
 Thanks, but I can walk. Kim starts to leave, turning around at the door. 
 
 Guess again. Three different students asked me to the prom tonight... I thought you had to be enrolled! 
 You're going? 
 
 (NODS) Not with any of them. Know any good-looking fathers? 
 
 (SMILES) - I'll keep my eyes open. See you later. She exits as Adele slowly lowers her legs to the floor. 
 Hi. Oblivious, Hammond buries the axe in the stump. Kim moves around to face him. When he sees her, Hammond jumps, startled. 
 I didn't hear you. 
 
 (SMILES) Sorry. Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Hammond struggles to catch his breath. 
 I'm getting too old for this. 
 Why are you doing it now? 
 Your mother's been hounding me to get it done... You got nay message? 
 
 
 Your secretary? 
 
 (NODS) Idiot! 
 I liked her. Hammond angrily jerks the axe from the stump. 
 
 HA` ONND 
 (SHRUGS) This thing with your mother... Have you seen her yet? 
 No. How is she? 
 
 (SIGHS) One minute she's depressed, the next she's bubbling over like a child... She wants to go with me tonight. 
 Great! 
 I'm not so sure. 
 I think getting dressed up and going out might be good for her. 
 HA",24OND She's had a bad day, Kim. I'm not sure she can handle it... See if you can talk to her. Hammond picks up the axe and sends it crashing into the stump. 
 Hi, Mom. 
 Nothing's cooking, Mom. You must've forgotten. Slipping out of her reverie, Vivian turns around to face Kim. 
 
 (SMILES) It doesn't matter. 
 You'll be beautiful. 
 (into the receiver) What I'm wearing now?... Oh, tonight! (smiles, gently stroking the gown) You'll find out soon enough. 
 (STIFFENS) Now, are we all set?... It better. I don't want her to ever forget tonight!... Okay, 'bye. Wendy hangs up the receiver and glances at her night table. A photograph of a grinning Nick McBride stares back. Wendy smiles and caresses her gown. 
 KI`RF Mom, it looks great... Vivian doesn't seem to hear her. She's rummaging through her purse. 
 No... I never... 
 I wouldn't take it without asking you... Vivian's very wound up. 
 (O.S.) let's go, we can't be late... 
 HAMIM0ND My God, we're going to look like twins. Vivian stops dead, looks at him. Hammond forces a smile. 
 
 Of course you did. He opens the door for her. She pauses to check herself in the mirror. 
 
 Vi... there's no time... 
 You don't look ridiculous, you look fine... 
 D Vi.. this is a big night for the school, it's a big night for me... I know how you're feeling... I understand... It's difficult for all of us... But we've got to make a special effort, Vi... We can't let the... terrible memories of this day affect us... That may seem cold and... insensitive to you, but it's the way it has to be.. He pauses, staring down at his wife. She's holding his gaze. 
 
 
 No! I don't... believe me.. 
 Vi... I just.. He's trying to stay calm, to keep the lid on. She's on the verge of tears. 
 
 Let's get going... He walks around to the driver's door. Vivian stares after him with hard cold eyes. 
 Well? Alex gapes, stunned by his sister's appearance. 
 
 
 (SMILES) You like? 
 You look almost like a woman! 
 
 (LAUGHS) Thanks! She picks up her corsage from her dressing table. 
 
 You're my sister... I'll leer! 
 
 (LAUGHS) Pin this on me, you creep, late. Alex takes the corsage. As he attaches the bright red flower on her gown, she playfully dabs perfume on his neck. He pulls back, pricking himself on the pin. 
 Hey! 
 You shouldn't have pulled away... The DOORBELL RINGS. 
 
 er's face is revealed. It is the nine-year-old Alex. Kim cradles the killer on the ground. She turns his head toward the light. We SEE his face full-on.

 O.S. You know, when you fire somebody you have to stick to your guns. 
 O.S. (continuing) The men might get to thinkin' that I'm weak if I take you back. 
 (continuing) And I didn't tell Dupree that I'd give you your job back... All I said was that I'd be glad to talk to you if you said the right thing... Do you have something to say? 
 Mr. Giacomo, when one of the white guys has come off a double shift and says he's too tired to work overtime, you don't fire him. 
 Fella, what'd I tell ya? If you're not willing to give a little extra, Champion can't use you. 
 (O.S.) Now... Do... you... have... something... to say? 
 (O.S.) Is that all? 
 I'm sorry, fella, but I gotta get back to work... 
 Hunh? 
 S'cuse me, Ezekiel. 
 O.S. Catch ya later, Joppy. 
 Hey, watch the marble!   Dammit, what'd I tell you? 
 I don't know.   Don't it say-- 
 Easy, come on over here. This here's somebody I want ya to meet... Come on. This here's a friend of mine. 
 Yeah, Easy.   This here's Mr. Albright. 
 You can call me Dewitt, Easy. 
 (bowing and grinning) Mr. Albright and me goes back to before the war when I was still in the fight game. 
 (to Easy) Ever seen this guy fight...? Any time Joppy Shag stepped in the ring you knew you were gonna see some real knock-down-drag-out- fisticuffs... Where you from, Easy? 
 Houston... Joppy's hometown. 
 So I hear you need a job. 
 Aw yeah, Easy always tryin' to do better. Got his high school certificate from night school. He's threatenin' up on some college. And he's one of the few colored men around here who owns his own house. Shoot, he pays a mortgage every month just like a white man. 
 Property owner, hunh? 
 (continuing) These big companies, don't give a damn, do they? 
 (continuing) If you need a job, drop by this address at seven tonight. 
 I do favors... I do favors for friends. Drop by. 
 Just somebody I know... A bidness man. 
 Oh, I don't ask him all that. He comes in here every so often looking for somebody to do a little job for him... He pays good. 
 I didn't say that... But if there's a dollar laying in the street I don't think he'll let a little dirt stop him from picking it up. If you worried about making that house note this month, maybe you wanna pay him a call. All them pretty girls you be with ain't gonna buy you a house. 
 (continuing) Sound like he just wants you to keep your eyes open for somebody... He'll pay you whether you see anything or not... If it was me I'd take that man's money and go on about my bidness... Ain't nothin' to worry about. 
 Want me to knock down some of them trees back there for you? 
 What are you doing here? 
 We only take deliveries between nine and six... 
 Yes, we do!   Now you'd better leave. 
 What? 
 Where's your delivery? 
 Did he give you a note to come in here after hours? 
 Well, did he?   Because if he didn't-- 
 Hold on. 
 (like an order) Across that way to the left and down the stairs... 
 (with an accent) Mr. Rawlins, put your hands up a little from your sides, please. 
 Don't worry, Manny. He's okay. Just a little shaky. (indicating the door) Let him know. 
 (smiling) Easy. 
 He doesn't want us to touch him. 
 Leave it, Shariff. I just wanted to make sure he was solo. 
 You're the boss. 
 You guys can go now. Easy and I have some business. 
 Have a seat, Mr. Rawlins. 
 Like you, Easy. I need a little help? I give 'em a call... Drink? 
 One thing I like about working for myself... I always have a bottle on the table... You wanna drink with me? Fine. You don't? Door's right behind you... Joppy tells me you're a war hero... Said you went in with Patton. 
 So, you want the job? 
 Walk out the door in the morning, Easy, and you're mixed up in something. Only thing that matters is if you're mixed up to the top or not. 
 Neither one of us wants to get mixed up in that. That's just rich people trying to keep me and you in our place. 
 I'm looking for somebody for a friend. 
 
 (O.S.) Daphne Monet... fiancée of Todd Carter, one of the richest men in town... Been gone for two weeks... 
 Evidently... You know how it is with women, Easy... Happens to the best of us... 
 That's a shame. 
 See, Daphne has a predilection for the company of Negroes. She likes jazz and pigs feet and dark meat, know what I mean. 
 I'm sure of it. But I can't go looking for her myself because I'm not of the right persuasion, so to speak. I've been asking Joppy for over a week, but all he could do was introduce me to you. 
 Just get a location on her. Mr. Carter wants to make up with her... 
 (smiling) That's all. 
 One hundred dollars, and I pay in advance. 
 That's right. And keep it, you know, confidential... 
 Joppy tells me you used to frequent an illegal club down on Eighty- ninth and Central. Somebody saw Daphne there a few nights ago. You could start tonight. 
 Hey, colored brother. I need you to do somethin' for me-- 
 O.S. WOMAN'S VOICE Go on. What'd I tell you about hair-assing my customers. 
 I just paid these damn cops and they still roustin' my customers. Well, that's what he gets for being with that white woman. 
 Come on, brother help me... 
 Don't worry 'bout him. I rung Junior ten minutes ago to come get him. 
 I ain't got nobody tonight but Lips and his trio -- Holiday came through here last Tuesday. 
 Yeah. 
 Where's he at? 
 Over there. Let Easy in upstairs and when these cops leave throw his ass out. 
 Not too much.    But stick around. 
 Sure. 
 Don't you hafta work tomorrow? 
 The last time I heard these fellas playin' tonight was back in Houston, the night your ole buddy Mouse had to pull me up off your ass. 
 Hell, that's the way it was. 
 (continuing) When you gonna admit that you helped Mouse kill old man Navrochet? 
 I don't pay them white girls no mind. 
 That's right. Just like you didn't help mouse kill his stepfather. 
 Hey, Easy. Did you help him kill his stepbrother, too? 
 Hey, Easy! 
 Naw, but if I see her I'm gonna keep her to myself. 
 Hey, Baby. 
 Easy. 
 (slowly) Well... It's goin' alright.   It sure is goin'. 
 O.S. Easy Rawlins, is that you? 
 You ain't jumped outta no windows yet? 
 Miss you down at the plant... You know Coretta, don't ya? 
 Oh, my goodness. 
 Could we sit down with y'all? 
 You know Benny just wants you to say you're sorry, Easy. And he'll give you your job back. 
 I got it, Easy. Your money ain't no good up in here. 
 You sure?   You the one outta work. 
 And you're the one ain't never got no money. 
 Aw, Baby... (to bootlegger) Get us another couple glasses. 
 Hey, Coretta got a new job at the phone company. 
 He used to play till the cock crowed. But that ole cock don't crow nearly so much now... 
 You be sorry if you go. 
 Daphne sleep by now. You can't get none of that tonight. 
 You been telling everybody Dahlia, but her name is Daphne. 
 Throw him in there on the bed, Easy. 
 Throwed him outta his place, 'cause he couldn't pay the rent. I shouldn't even let him sleep here. 
 That all you need? 
 Dupree run through his money, fall asleep on me. And you just gonna walk out on me like I was dog food... 
 Why you keep askin' 'bout her? Colored women ain't good enough for you no more? 
 (O.S.) Way he snorin'? 
 Oh yeah, daddy. You hittin' my spot! Oh yeah... yeah! 
 (coy, shy) Oooh, that's just too good, Easy. 
 I can't give up that much love, daddy, not the way things is. 
 You know, Dupree's right there in the next room. 
 But it ain't right, Easy. Here I am doin' this right in the next room and all you doin' is nosin' after my friend Daphne... 
 What job? 
 What man? 
 But Daphne's my friend-- 
 Oh, baby. Oh, daddy, you hittin' my spot! Oh, yeah... 
 EASY (CONT'D) Write me and tell me when's a good time." (looks up) Aw shit. 
: 
 Drive to the trainyard, Easy! Let's dump this damn thing. 
 (still looking away) Just drive this sumbitch! 
 Bye, Easy! 
 Back to Texas... It's too fast for me out here. 
 A 
 LATER - NIGHT 
 O.S. Mr. Rawlins, I've been expecting your call. 
 O.S. I hope you have good news for me. 
 Sure is, Easy. What's shakin'? 
 Hold on to that, Easy. I like to look a man in the face when we do business. Meet me at the Fisherman's Pier in Malibu at the hamburger stand in an hour. 
 O.S. Hi. 
 It's pretty out here, huh? 
 I'm from Des Moines in Iowa.    Where are you from? 
 Do they have an ocean in Texas? 
 Who cares? My sister brought me 'cause my parents made her. All she wants to do is make out with Herman and smoke cigarettes. 
 (yelling) Leave him alone, Herman!   We were just talking! 
 You were, huh? (to Easy) We don't need you talking to our women. 
 Hey!   What's wrong? 
 Nigger's trying to pick up Barbara. 
 Leave him alone! We were just talking about the ocean! 
 BARBARA'S SISTER Barbara! 
 Hey, fella, what's wrong with you? 
 You already got trouble, boy. 
 No, you weren't. You were talkin' about the ocean! 
 O.S. Excuse me. 
 What do you want? 
 I want to see brains.    I want you to die for me. 
 (quickly) I'm sorry, sir. 
 The question is: "Are you sorry enough?" 
 Yessir. 
 Then prove it... Show him... Get down on your knees and suck his peter. 
 (to Football) You heard me. 
 Son of a gun. You were gonna do it, weren't you? 
 Sick bastard. 
 Get out of here. You call the cops, I'll kill ya! 
 I don't think they'd dare call the cops. (giggles) But it'll cost me a few bucks if they do. 
 What you got, Easy? 
 Course not. Mr. Carter wants to buy her a gold ring and live happily ever after -- What do ya got? 
 Where? 
 Anything else? 
 Ever seen him in action? 
 Here's another hundred. 
 Buy ya a burger, Easy? 
 How come you let those boys get around you like that? War hero should have been able to pick 'em off one by one before they got you against the rail. 
 Take it easy. 
 Mr. Rawlins. 
 Mr. Rawlins, I'm Miller and this is my partner, Mason. 
 We want you to come with us. 
 You'll see. 
 You'll see. 
 You got a right to fall down and break your face, nigger. You got a right to die. 
 (O.S.) You got 'im, huh, Miller? 
 (O.S.) Yeah, we got him coming home. Nothing on 'im. 
 Ezekiel Rawlins. 
 We can take off the cuffs if you wanna cooperate. 
 Where were you this morning at about five A.M.? 
 He means-- 
 --this morning. 
 (wandering over) He didn't look at a clock. 
 You were drinkin' down on Eighty- ninth and Central... At an illegal club called John's, weren't you? 
 You may as well answer 'cause you got bigger troubles than us bustin' an illegal bar, Ezekiel. 
 Means we can take your black ass out behind the station and put a bullet in your head. 
 Now. What time did you leave Coretta James' house this morning? 
 Sit down. 
 Did you go back and see Miss James later in the day? 
 Did you and Dupree Brouchard have words over Miss James? 
 You heard 'im. Did you two argue over Coretta James? 
 She went to sleep too, Ezekiel. But she won't be waking up... 
 (continuing) Where'd you go when you left Miss James' house? 
 You heard him, where'd you go? 
 Get up slow... Real fuckin' slow or you know what's gonna happen. 
 Okay.   Let's take him out back. 
 No.   Let's go. 
 Bullshit, I'm gonna blow his-- 
 Let's go! 
 Son-of-a-bitch! Son-of-a-bitch! 
 Hey, Buddy!... It's a long walk... why don't you let us give you a ride? 
 Ezekiel, hold on. 
 Come on, fella. Somebody in the back wants to talk to you. 
 Jump in. We'll take you.    My boss wants to talk to you. 
 (continuing) Come on. If we wanted to hurt you it would have already happened... 
 I can see that the police roughed you up a bit... That's a terrible practice of theirs which has to change, Mr. Rawlins... Has to change. 
 (continuing) She was beaten. And died from a heavy blow to the back of the head, Mr. Rawlins. 
 The evening's events have caught my adopted son and I quite off guard... My household was asleep when we got the call that the police had a suspect in Coretta James' murder... Did you know that she was a friend of mine, Mr. Rawlins!? 
 Oh, you know who I am? 
 (correcting) I am the next mayor, Mr. Rawlins... And luckily for you, a friend of the Negro... When I arrived at the station I knew right off that you were being improperly detained as is Coretta's boyfriend, Dupree Brouchard. It's this sort of thing that my administration will not tolerate, Mr. Rawlins. Absolutely will not... 
 (continuing) Yes... Coretta answered phones for a while in my campaign office on 103rd and Western. In fact my people got her a job in the phone company. So when I heard what had happened I got out of bed immediately, personally because of my concern... Was anyone there with you Mr. Rawlins besides Mr. Dupree Brouchard?... Any... other friends of Coretta's? 
 No young lady perhaps? 
 Of course not, Mr. Rawlins. And why should you tell a man whom you've only just met. But, believe me, Mr. Rawlins. You can trust me. 
 Well don't worry, Mr. Rawlins... I won't tolerate your being harassed... You or any of my constituency -- I was a city councilman in the Watts area for two terms with a large contingent of colored -- I value all of my supporters equally... humble though they may be -- where can we drop you, Mr. Rawlins? 
 Are you sure, Mr. Rawlins? This must be quite out of your way. 
 Norman, pull the car over. 
 Mr. Rawlins, may I offer you cab fare? 
 CORETTA'S VOICE You be sorry if you go... (heavy breathing) I can't give up that much love, daddy, not the way things is. 
 CORETTA'S VOICE Oh yeah, daddy. You hittin' my spot... Oh yeah... oh yeah... 
 CORETTA'S VOICE Oh, that's just too good, Easy.   Oh daddy... oh yeah... 
 CORETTA'S VOICE Oh, baby. Oh, daddy, yeah... Oh yeah!! Oh Yea-a-h!! 
 (a woman's) Hello? Is this Mr. Rawlins? 
 Daphne... Daphne Monet... 
 You're looking for me. 
 I think you should come and talk to me, Mr. Rawlins... alone. 
 Mr. Rawlins, Coretta has been killed... 
 And if you don't want any trouble from the police then you'll come... And you won't tell anyone that you're coming. 
 I'm at the Sunridge Motel on 112th and Grand, Room 102. 
 (O.S.) Mr. Rawlins? 
 Please come in. 
 Would you like a drink? 
 Please sit down. 
 What happened to you?   Have you been fighting? 
 I should be asking you that question. Why have you been asking about me? 
 So...?   You've found me. 
 You can stop pretending, Mr. Rawlins. I know someone hired you to look for me. In fact I had to pay Coretta not to tell you where I was... you know how Coretta is... (forces a weak smile) She told me you two became 'good friends' yesterday... (tears gather in her eyes) I talked to her this morning before she died. (regaining control) I... uh... need to go across town to see someone. It's very important... I can't seem to reach him by phone. I'm afraid I'd better have someone go with me. 
 Call me Daphne. 
 I can understand why you'd be nervous... because I threatened you with Coretta... I'm very sorry, but I couldn't think of any other way to get you to come. 
 He's out of town -- I... I'm willing to pay you. 
 --I know that. 
 I know all about that, Mr. Rawlins. 
 --Mr. Rawlins-- 
 Easy... If you don't help me, then I'll call the police and tell them that you were with Coretta before she died and that you've been after me too. 
 Yes, I would.    I don't want to but I would. 
 Please let me pay you. 
 Why? 
 Please, I'll pay you twenty dollars. 
 Thirty... or even more.    Name your price. 
 (continuing) Go ahead. There's gotta be something that you want. 
 (angrily, sarcastically) What? Are you afraid I'll yell rape or something? 
 Easy, don't touch that door-- 
 I'm really very sorry.   I really am. 
 (continuing) I didn't want to do this but... Shall we? 
 They must not have seen us that well... God, Frank and I have been pulled over so many times I thought-- 
 (continuing) Easy, I'm sorry... Don't be mad at me. 
 (continuing) Come on. 
 (continuing) You really hate me, don't you? 
 Around the next bend... (she grins) You remind me of Frank when he gets angry. 
 Your jaw sets just like his when-- 
 (sighing) Just park behind the Studebaker. 
 Did you bring a gun or something? 
 Easy, that's not very smart. Everybody carries a weapon now a days. 
 Search me sometime.   You'll find it. 
 Mr. McGee... 
 Oh, my God! 
 Easy. 
 I expected you to be home, so Manny used a screwdriver on the door. What happened to your face? 
 (still smiling) I'd tear your nigger head out by its root. 
 Where have you been this time of morning, Easy? 
 I didn't come here to play, boy. You got my money in your pocket and we've been over at that address waitin' all night for Frank Green and now we've found out that he moved from there over a year ago. 
 Do you believe in God, Easy? 'Cause I'm curious to see if death is any different for a religious man. 
 Where? 
 How'd she know about you? 
 Why didn't you call me? 
 Where is she? 
 (dangerously) Where is she? 
 (nodding) Uh-hunh. 
 You call the cops? 
 What'd she do, take his car? 
 McGee.   Did she take his car? 
 Where'd you pick her up at? 
 --Write it down! 
 Get me some whiskey, Easy. 
 Well, I'll be damned. Get us a drink, Manny... Easy, you're a brave man. I need a brave man working for me... But you gotta find Frank Green, so he can lead us to her. 
 Easy, you're connectable to two murders. You'll do whatever I tell you to do. 
 (continuing) Now you got three days to find him. And you make sure you count 'em right. 
: 
 (O.S.) Number please... 
 (O.S.) Yes? 
 Hey, Easy. 
 What girl is that? 
 Uh, huh.   That's pretty lucky, hunh? 
 Maybe she looked in the phone book. 
 What the hell you mean, coming up here all mad like you gonna do something?!... 
 (yelling back) What did I tell you? To just take that man's money! I didn't tell you to do nothin'! I call myself trying to help you save your house... Don't come up in here startin' no shit with me. 
 (continuing; panicked) Easy, wait! Watch my marble! My uncle left me that when he died! 
 Let's talk.   Let's just talk. 
 She asked me to help her 'cause I told her that Albright was lookin' for her. And I figured I could help you make a few bucks and throw Albright off the trail too. She wanted to know something about you so I told her... I guess I must've give her your phone number... 
 I don't know... 
 I ain't lyin'... I don't even know her that good. She just asked me to help her. And she asked me not to tell nobody... I guess 'cause of her and Frank Green. 
 I swear I don't know. She didn't tell me. I didn't mean to get you into nothin', Easy... I just... she just... I mean you seen her, Easy... Man, she's something else. 
 May I help you? 
 Do you have an appointment? 
 Well, I'm sorry, but Mr. Carter is a very busy man. 
 May I ask the nature of your call, Mister...? 
 I'm quite sure, Mr. Rawlins, that whatever you know is nothing I can't know as well. 
 Is this some sort of joke? 
 O.S. Uh... Excuse me... 
 Mr. Rawlins was it? 
 Baxter. (to the secretary) I'll take care of this. (and back to Easy) Why don't you come with me, sir? 
 Not very smart talking about Mr. Carter's business to a secretary. 
 Mr. Rawlins. 
 (distraught) Has something happened to Daphne? 
 You saw her? 
 She's still in town? 
 What did she say -- what was she wearing? 
 And a pin on her chest? 
 (carried away) Oh yes, that's her. That's her. You know I've never known a woman who could wear perfume so slight that-- 
 What did she say? What did she say?... Oh, I'm sorry. Brandy? 
 Yes...? 
 I beg your pardon. 
 (after a moment) Mr. Albright? 
 There must be some mistake... I'm sorry, busy... Who are you talking about? 
 No... Until just now I was sure that she was hundreds of miles away from here... You say someone is looking for her? 
 (half to himself) Someone is looking for her. 
 Uh... I don't know... We were going to be married... We had a fight... (then recovering) Uh... that's none of your concern, Mr. Rawlins. 
 (continuing) Someone's... after her? A Mr. Albright? And he said he's working for me? 
 No... I can't say that I do. 
 Uh... I can't say -- I don't know... 
 (continuing) Do you think you could find her again? 
 It's important, Mr. Rawlins, for her sake... I'm willing to pay you. 
 I can't tell you any more Mr. Rawlins -- I'll pay you to find her... 
 A thousand dollars?! 
 Mr. Rawlins. I think you're trying to take advantage of me. But left me inform you that the incumbent mayor and the chief of police eat at my house regularly. 
 --No.   They can't! 
 I'll have Baxter write you out a check. 
 (terse) I'll have Baxter write you a check. 
 (with finality) Baxter will write you a check!! 
 Take it all... Just take it all. 
: 
 You the reason why she told me to lay low, hunh. 
 You a dead man-- 
 O.S. Easy, you in there? 
 Want me to kill him? 
 Well, what's happenin'? 
 I'll blow your goddamned nose off... 
 Nigga, you heard him. 
 Huh?... He's busy right now, you gonna have to call back. 
 Easy, lemme try. 
 You better... 
 (THUNK!) Talk... 
 (THUNK!) You stupid-- 
 Get out of my way! 
 Damn you, Easy. Don't you never grab me when I got a gun in my hand! 
 Look at the blood you done got on my coat. Why you wanna go and do that? 
 Now we got to find that girl so we can get that money. 
 You standing there with a knot on your head the size of a twelve- year-old tittie and you "don't need my kind of help"? 
 Aw, easy, that was a long time ago. 
 (after a moment) Come on, Easy. Cut me in on this. I could help you. I let you run the show. I swear I will. 
 I swear, I ain't gonna do nothin' you don't tell me to do. 
 Everything you say. 
 (O.S.) I don't know... Sound like some white girl. 
 Hey, Easy, was it a left on Richland or a right? 
 Mr. Rawlins... We came to ask you a few more questions. 
 (grinning) So why don't you just invite us inside... (holding open the door) After you. 
 What happened to your head? I don't remember doing all that. 
 Been having a party, Ezekiel? 
 You got a lotta cuts and bruises to be an ordinary working stiff. 
 It's looking worse and worse for you, my friend. What do you know about Richard McGee? 
 A dead white man in a cabin in Laurel Canyon. 
 He hangs out with some of those same nigger friends of yours down on Central Avenue. 
 He just happened to have a note in his pocket with 'C. James' written on it. 
 Any of this making you feel talkative at all, 'cause I'll bet ya six bits to a bottle of piss that we're looking at a double here... All we need is to place you in the dead man's house. 
 Where? 
 How 'bout a smoke, Ezekiel? 
 Got a light? 
 May I? 
 Nice lighter... 
 And we got our print. 
 Oh, hadn't you heard? We found a cigarette lighter in the dead man's house with the killer's fingerprints on it. 
 Course you did, we got evidence. 
 We know that you know more than you're lettin' on. And now a white man's been killed. (MORE) 
 MILLER (CONT'D) Now you better tell us what you know, or you're goin' down for the murder of Richard McGee and Coretta James. 
 (to Mason) Put the cuffs on. Let's take him down. 
 But we do... 
 And that's all that counts. 
 Tell it to the D.A. 
 Forget it. 
 Okay.   Tomorrow morning, that's it. 
 Have a nice evening, Ezekiel. 
 A88   EASY'S POV                                                       A88 
 (shrugging) Hell yeah. They'd be dead. 
 What they tryin' to pin on you? 
 Yeah. 
 What you want? 
 I ain't got time now.   I'm tryin' to get some sleep. 
 Why don't you open the door, Junior, 'fore I have to shoot it down. 
 Mouse. 
 Open up.   We ain't got all night. 
 Y'all want a beer? 
 Huh?   What you talkin' 'bout? 
 You crazy, man. You crazy! 
 Sit down, Junior. 
 I don't know what you talkin' 'bout. 
 What fingerprints? What house? 
 I ain't killed nobody. 
 You thick-headed, ya damn self!! 
 Sit down, man... 'fore I blow your brains out. 
 What kinda shit y'all trying to pull here? 
 (last warning) Sit down. 
 Aw, man... 
 I don't even know who you-- 
 I didn't! I didn't touch nothin' in his house! 
 Hattie had me take him out to his car. And he say he give me ten dollars to drive him home. 
 I know you took that. 
 Hell, yeah. Then he asked me about that white girl you was askin' everybody about at the club. And I told him I seen her with Coretta... What the hell I care if he know? 
 I don't like your ass, Easy.   And he gimme fifty dollars. 
 Naw.   To deliver a letter. 
 How should I know? He just said to give it to her. 
 I didn't say that! I give it to Coretta to give it to her the next mornin'! 
 'Cause he had to blow town, fool! 
 He didn't say! 
 I'm tellin' the truth. I ain't killed nobody. That man was alive when I left him! 
 (to the dog) Go on. Go on in the back. 
 Yeah, Easy! Cops just let me out today. My sister gone to work and I didn't feel much like talking... Raymond... 
 Hey, big man!    Them pigtails I smell? 
 Yeah. Lula Mae made some 'fore she went to work. 
 Why somebody wanna kill her like that? Why? 
 Letter?   What kinda letter? 
 Naw. But I know it was on account of her that Coretta got killed. 
 (continuing) Everything between Coretta and that Daphne was always such a damn secret... I mean that ole girl didn't think nothin' about two- timin' on Frank... She probably 'innerduced' Coretta to one of them ole guys she knew... And when he came to the house after Coretta... (starting to break) ...he found out she wasn't that kinda woman... Cops said she fought him... aw my Gawd... fought him 'cause she wouldn't have nobody but me-e-e... 
 (continuing) Aw Gawd, I can't even go to sleep... 'cause I can still see her face that mornin' 'fore I went to work... (MORE) 
 DUPREE (CONT'D) Junior had been by and just left the house... and she came runnin' out to the car carrying her bible... And she said, 'Keep this for me, baby.' 
 (continuing) Police won't even let me go near her house. So it's the only thing I got left from her. It was a sign... I know it was a sign, 'cause she was so religious... 
 It's all right, big man... it's all right... 
 That Dupree is a good man, but he sure can't hold his liquor. 
 You callin' me drunk? 
 If I was drunk could I do this? 
 Ain't a man in Texas can outdraw me! 
 Go on. 
 Go for your gun. Let's see who gets kilt. 
 You fool enough to go without a piece then you must wanna be dead. 
 He fool enough to call me out and he ain't even got no gun? I'll kill the motherfucker. 
 Motherfucker better be scared. I kill a motherfucker. I kill him! 
 
 Are you all right? 
 What happened? 
 I'm sorry, Easy... 
 (continuing) Easy, Coretta's boyfriend, Dupree, got out of jail today. And... 
 DAPHNE                          EASY (continuing)                    (he joins her) I need you to help me           You need me to help you find him.                       find him. 
 Easy, I paid seven thousand dollars for those pictures. They belong to me. 
 Easy, you wouldn't dare. 
 I don't know -- I'll pay you for them. I'll give you a thousand dollars. 
 Okay, I'll give you seven. 
 Never mind. I'll give it to you. Easy, please. They're very important to me. 
 Easy, honey, I don't know. 
 Easy, why don't you just take the money! 
 Easy, please.  How much do you want? 
 Easy, put the phone down. 
 Easy, please. 
 Easy, please, put it down... 
 OPERATOR'S VOICE Number please... 
 (soberly) Frank is my brother. 
 OPERATOR'S VOICE Number please? 
 We have different fathers. Mine is white... Frank doesn't even know that Todd and I broke up. So far I've kept him out of all this. 
 See, Coretta's the only one out here in L.A. besides my brother who knew about me... (she lights up) And about a month ago she took a job working for, of all people, Matthew Teran. She made friends with one of the girls in the office who told her that she'd heard that Teran was a pedophile. And Coretta got carried away and told her that Todd Carter was engaged to a colored woman. She was sorry and didn't think it would get to Teran... but it did and he got a hold of my birth records. 
 (continuing) Todd and I broke up and I paid a guy for the pictures of Teran. But somehow Coretta got them. 
 It was an accident. Coretta and I were still mad at each other. I mean, she threatened to sell Teran the pictures. 
 I just asked Joppy to go over and put a scare in her... It was an accident. 
: 
 (V.O.) Joppy said she pulled a knife and tried to dump hot water on him... 
 God, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... It's just that with the pictures I can-- 
 Don't judge me, Easy! Do you think I like pretending that I'm someone else? Do you know how I've been treated by people, colored and white, when I've tried to live as a colored woman in a colored community. Do you have any idea what any colored man whose ever been with me has had to go through? Don't you dare judge me! 
 (continuing) Come on, Easy. Help me. 
 (continuing) Come on, you know it's the right thing to do... You know if things were different what would happen between us. 
 (genuinely hurt) Sure, baby. Of course, sweetheart... 
 Well I'll be damned. You found her. 
 (to Daphne) Where are the pictures? 
 (terrified) I don't know. 
 Where are they? 
 (indicating Easy) I wouldn't tell him! And I won't tell you! 
 Sure you will. (to Shariff) Let's go. 
 What're you doin'? Who are we gonna give 'em to cover this shit, hunh?... Use your head. 
 MOUSE'S VOICE (groggy) Yeah. 
 MOUSE'S VOICE Hey, Easy? 
 MOUSE'S VOICE You alright? 
 Easy, what the hell you-- 
 Man, I don't-- 
 There's a cabin out in Malibu on Route 9... 
 I guess so. He's done this kinda thing out there before. 
 Easy, what's done got into you? Thought y'all was friends. 
 You lyin'. 
 Son-of-a-bitch! 
 You lyin'! 
 Aw shit! 
 Oh, my God!... Oh, my goodness! 
 (O.S.) Oh, my goodness! 
 Yeah, that's it. 
 Naw.   It's farther up. 
 Another ten minutes, I guess. Easy, I swear, I ain't done nothin' to nobody. I swear, I ain't. 
 There it is. 
 Easy, come on, man. That girl is lying if she told you I killed them folks. 
 Let's just shoot him. 
 ALBRIGHT'S VOICE Come on, talk to me. Talk to me while you still can. 
 DAPHNE'S VOICE (sobbing) Please! I don't have them!     Easy has them! 
 ALBRIGHT'S VOICE You said he didn't know anything. 
 DAPHNE'S VOICE I was lying!! 
 ALBRIGHT'S VOICE Okay. Grab that for me, Shariff. It's ready. 
 DAPHNE'S VOICE No-o-o-o!   Please. No-o-o! 
 ALBRIGHT'S VOICE Now talk to me, goddammit! 
 DAPHNE'S VOICE No-o-o! 
 (O.S.) (to Shariff) Who the hell's out there? 
 (getting frantic) I don't know! 
 (O.S.) That you, Easy? 
 (SILENCE) Tell us what you want, buddy.   See what we can work out. 
 (O.S.) Easy... Hey, Buddy (then to Shariff) Come on, goddammit! 
 Damn, damn, damn! I hit him!     I hit him! 
 There's blood all over here... I got him. 
 Damn.   Sweetheart. 
 She okay? 
 I didn't have time to be tying him up. 
 Why what? You just said don't shoot him. And I didn't... I choked his ass... 
 How I'm gonna help you back there foolin' 'round with him? 
 Aw, man. If you didn't want him kilt you shouldn't have left him with me. 
 EASY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Because she was still in shock and couldn't really talk... Maybe too because she had stolen about four times that much from Carter. 
 Listen, if you think you gonna have trouble with that dude Frank, I can run by and kill him and take that evening train to Houston. 
 Oh.   This is for you. 
 I cut you in for half 'cause I knew you was too big a fool to take your share from that white girl yourself. 
 Send my grip to Etta Mae. I'm gonna see if she'll take me back now that I'm flush. 
 Oh, here's the keys to Dupree's car. 
 And if you need somebody to run them streets with ya, gimme a call. You know how to put some money in a nigga's pocket. 
 Daphne!   Daphne, sweetheart! 
 Come on, Easy. Let's go. 
 (continuing) Don't worry, you can give him the pictures yourself. 
 Here's the remaining eight hundred that I owe you... in cash... And another thousand which I hope will keep this whole thing... you know. 
 (continuing) And I've taken care of your problems with the police. You'll have no more trouble there. And that's a promise. 
 (continuing; to Easy) Mr. Rawlins... did Daphne ever say... she loved me? 
 O.S. Hey, Ezekiel. 
 You got some mighty powerful friends up there... mighty powerful. But, see, we got a problem. 
 (continuing) With the Chief sealing these things up like this, it doesn't do much for the morale of the men who've been working on these cases. 
 Yeah.   Makes 'em feel like shit. 
 There's a guy who's been callin' on the phone. And we're pretty sure that he was up there with McGee. 
 A... uh... colored guy... sounds kinda dumb... 
 (correcting) Not very bright... But he said you accused him of the murder. And he swears you were up there, too... 
 In fact, he's out and out pointing the finger at ya. 
 How about a name? 
 He'd do it to you... 
 You son-of-a-bitch... You watch yourself, you hear! Don't you even spit on the fucking sidewalk... I better not even-- 
 Hey, Easy, where's your car? 
 Yeah. Man can't get no decent job in this town without a car. 
 Ain't thinkin' 'bout no job?   How you gonna live? 
 What you talkin' 'bout, 'favors'? 
 You talkin' about private investigatin' or somethin'... You could get in trouble doin' that. 
 Yeah, Easy... 
 All you got is your friends, Easy... 
 EASY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

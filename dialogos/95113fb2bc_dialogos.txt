 
 DARKNESS - NOW 
 Sandra. 
 Shut the fuck up. 
 (to the GUARD, a snarl) Putcher dick away... 
 Get some. 
. 
 (O.S.) (clean, disconnected) Eat shit please. 
 (O.S.) Can't say I didn't try... 
 (O.S.) Shit! Shit! 
 (O.S.) Suckage. 
... 
 1 Good run, Kable. 
 1 Whatever your name is. You got to the save point fast. 
 2 So the fuck what? No one's getting out of here alive. 
 1 I am.   I'm going to make it. 
 2 Sure you will. 
 1 (tuning the BROWN out, turning his attention to KABLE) They say you only got three battles left til you get out... 
. 
. 
 Counting down five... four... three... two... 
 We're cunt hair close - 
 All respect, Bob, nobody cares about dead Orientals... they care about Ken Castle - 
 Burger chili fry? 
: 
. 
 
 First... there was society... 
. 
 I ain't complainin'! 
 Nine months ago, Castle unveiled a new simulation - one that would take gaming to new heights of thrilling excess... and controversy 
 -. 
: 
 (big smile) Slayers. 
 Gina, when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered? I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate - (points for emphasis) ...each one offered a chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence. Stay alive for thirty sessions and get set free... that's not a bad God damned deal. 
 I'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government... that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars... and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American public. 
 (to BOARD OP) What'd he say? 
 There's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers... shouldn't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides - they only need to survive one session. 
 TO: 
 Simple. 
 (coy) Did I? You know I seem to recall that - let's just see... 
 You like her? Her name is Gina. She's a good little bitch. 
 This motherfucker is off the charts. 
 (shrugs) Why would he? (MORE) 
 That's fuckin scary. 
 Similar, yep. But control is strictly localized to the parameters of our gaming environments. 
 (teasing) To some, maybe... to some... don't you suspect a good many folks wouldn't mind an itty bit of control? 
 Someone else making all the decisions for you... no responsibilities, no tough choices... think about it. 
 
 Good little talk. 
 What the hell is that? 
: 
 
 Ken Castle wants you to believe that you are living in a safer, better world. He's a liar. Mind control is slavery. We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue. 
 Mr. Castle, we have no idea... 
 Shush! 
. 
 (to his techies) Bypass orbital, reroute from the backup servers, NOW, for Christ sake, you dirty apes... (to CASTLE) Sorry, Mr. Castle, we can't hard- line a live broadcast. It's impossible to stop every virus that sneaks in. 
 Uh huh. You might wanna oughta let my boys take a look at your firewall. 
 He's good. 
. 
 Wanna blow off a little steam? 
                            * Fuck him up. 
: 
: 
 (quiet, conspiratorial) Kable. Kable. 
 Tillmans, yeah, Tillmans, I knew that, they said you name's was Tillmans... just sittin, always sittin, always lookin, just lookin... like me, I keep my holes down... you got to, man... a dude inevitably start to break up, start to crack and break up everyday, never know you gonna die today or live another two, three. You never do know. All these niggaz gonna snap, snap, snap, one by one, every last one, all of em. Yeah but not you. Twenty seven battles and three to go... no one ever got that close before, no one even done ten games without gettin they brains shot... but Kable, Kable, Kable, he just sittin, lookin, like he got a plan, he already somewhere else, he on a mission, nothin' get in his way, never break, never snap, never say shit, just take care of his business, niggaz get spooked by that shit. You spooky. 
 Master! Master! Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings - Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams... 
 (O.S.) You want to get back to them. 
 (O.S.) Sign it. 
 (O.S.) Sign it... please, Tillman. My son David is your biggest fan. He prays for you. 
 (O.S.) You don't even know what's going on out there, do you? (beat) Damn... 
... 
... 
 Damn, I gonna have to eat you now, son. 
 Oh shit... oh shit... 
 Wul hello thar... 
 What'd he say? 
. 
 Who are they... who the fuck are they... who's playing us? 
. 
 Gay... gay... gay... super gay... hm. 
 Swarmers. The latest innovation from Browning, this self detonating cartridge offers the widest and deadliest spray available from a full tracking, cornering ordnance. 
 Daddy like... 
 Simon! 
 Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted I'll unmute you. 
 You suck, Simon - you're going to get my boyfriend killed before he can get out of jail and fill me up with his hot seed. 
 Uh huh. 
 Shut up bitch. 
 What is that? (like a dentist) Aaaa. 
 Hey sissy. 
 Wanna make out? 
 Simon? 
 Maybe. 
 (star struck) Oh my god, it's really you!!! 
 Nice. 
 (in unison) Do you wanna see our tits, Simon? 
 (shrugs) Uh, sure. 
 1 Mmmmm, now that we have your attention, here's another offer you can't refuse. 
 Here we go. 
 2 Fifty million euros for control of Kable, instant transfer to the account of your choice. 
 Question: do I look like I need the money? We've discussed this before - Kable is not for sale. 
 1 (feeling herself up) Baby... make it a hundred. 
 It's been real. 
: 
!!! 
. 
 GIRL'S HAND... 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 So what's your damage? 
 GORGE/ANGIE You know, just hanging out. (beat) Looking to meet people. 
 Lucky you... 
 You met me. 
 (echoing) You met me. 
 GORGE/ANGIE I'm Nika. 
 DALE/GUY I'm Dale. (looks her up and down) I like your fur. 
 GORGE/ANGIE Do you want to go somewhere? 
 DALE/GUY We are somewhere. 
 - 
 SOUND: SLUUURRRRRRRP. 
. 
 GET IT OUT OF ME...! 
 What the hell happened to this one? 
 Look like he escaped. 
 Back to your Jazzercise, girls... 
 Tillmans. 
 New dude, new dude... that's Hackman. They say he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people... one day he just walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit... never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people... 
 (O.C.) Hey Kable. 
. 
 Who aims? 
 Who aims... the slayer? Or the player? 
 That's tripped. 
 Why? 
 Yeah, the ping... they talk about that. The time it takes the slayer to respond to the command... it's like, five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping... 
. 
 Hey. Kable. 
 No. Wait. Look. 
 I'm going to delete you too. On Sunday. 
 That's why they put me here. 
 On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I meant your pretty girls... You want to get back to them but I'm going to visit them first... 
: 
 He's so perfect. 
. 
 2 He's scary. 
 Yeah... 
 2 (playing dumb) But they love Kable. 
 3 He's right. 
 (unaffected) They do now. But when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs, so vivid it's like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh - Trust me, they'll change their point of view. 
 2 How can you be sure? 
 It's human nature. They'll be seduced by the power, the violence... the dominance... 
 3 (shaking his head) Guess we never figured on Kable blowing up as big as he did. 
 Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con... 
 2 Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers. What did you expect? 
 3 (musing) His instincts give him an edge. 
 2 And in the hands of a talented player... 
 3 Of course we can never let him out. Not after what we did to him. 
 2 Tell me again why we don't just get rid of the problem... (makes a throat slashing motion) You know, off camera? 
 YOU - lack a flair for marketing. The people would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought down. 
 3 One thing I know is what makes people tick. 
 (O.S.) Kable, dude. It's me. 
 (O.S.) Simon. (beat) I'm playing you, dummy. 
 (O.S.) It's a mod. 
 (O.S.) I know. 
 It's cool, yeah? 
 4 This is real, this is real, this is real!!!! 
 (O.S.) That was sick. 
 (O.S.) I'm nineteen. 
 (O.S.) Cause I'm a badass motherfucker. 
 (mumbling) Gotta keep my holes down... keep `em down. Freek's gonna make it, gonna cut, gonna scatter... gonna burn this joint... 
 (O.S.) Gibs. 
 (O.S.) Like, giblets. Kibbles and bits. Chunks. Pieces. 
 (O.S.) Death row psychos, so what?          They had it coming. 
 (O.S.) Yeah, but you're different. 
 (O.S.) Dude, I don't know. Cause you're MY psycho. 
 (O.S.) Damn, new area. 
 (O.S.) Think about it, Kable: all the shit we've been through together. What an epic run. (beat) It's going to suck to see it end. 
 Well, yeah - I get that for you it's different. 
 (O.S.) There's nothing there. 
 (O.S.) (sarcastic) Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the visual, but it's a restricted area. It's beyond the borders of the game. I couldn't put you there if I tried. 
. 
 (O.S.) ... shit shit shit! 
 (friendly) Bye Kable. 
 (O.S.) (offended) Hey. 
 What the hell...? 
 But- 
! 
 (looks over her paperwork) So... Miss Roth. 
 Delia.   Her name is Delia. 
 Spouse incarcerated, life without possibility of parole. You use your maiden name. 
 My husband - he... it's not entirely true, regarding his sentence. In fact, he's due to be released soon... 
 Your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder, Miss Roth. I can hardly consider his release, if it was to occur, to be a positive. 
 I work in society. 
 Acting, is that what they call it? 
 It's a job. 
 Miss Roth. Your child has been... exceedingly well placed. The new family is very wealthy. She'll never want for anything. (leans in) I understand you love your little girl, but... do you really think she'd be better off with people like you? 
 Yes, I do.     I'm her mother. 
. 
 We will give your application all the consideration that it merits. 
 You like the software? 
 (confused) Software... 
 The walkie talkie, playa. 
 No shit... you're the guy from TV. The HUMANZ. 
 That's right, baby. You think about what the brotha said? 
 To what, um, brotha do you refer... brotha? 
 Kable wants the freedom to ass- kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him? 
 You were listening. 
 We see and hear everything that goes on inside the so-called game. 
 Alright, then. (considering) Kable said we got lucky - that they were gunning for us - what was that all about? 
 Kable got a past... he knows things. Things he don't even know he know. 
 Huh?   What things? 
 Things Castle's afraid of. As long as your boy stay on the inside Castle know he can keep him quiet - but if ever got out... (shakes his head) Uh uh. Castle will never let that happen. 
 One battle left, I think I can handle my bidness. 
 You're not hearing me - this is not something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No Kable, no pussy, no shit. 
 This is, come on... too heavy... I don't know what the hell you're talking about... I just play games, man. Games. 
 Mm hm. That's right, it's a game. (changing gears) You want to win it, don't you? 
 Yeah, dude, I intend to. 
 Then you need to cutcho strings, puppet-massa. 
 That... would be cheating. 
 A mod, that's all. Like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and shit. 
 (nervous) Uhhh... 
 The game got to mutate, after all. It got to evolve, you feel me? 
 I do. I do feel you. 
 Then let's rock, baby. 
... 
 (O.S.) (whispering) Tillman. 
 (O.S.) We know you talked to him... your Player. 
 (O.S.) A friend. 
 (O.S.) Listen to me: Simon's going to give you what you want. What you asked him for. 
 (O.S.) I know something else: whether or not he's controlling you, you will never reach the save point. Castle won't allow it. 
 (O.S.) No. Listen to me, Tillman - the game is unwinnable - they will not let you live. If you're want to get out and see the people in the picture you'll have to find another way. 
 (O.S.) What, Kable... what can I get you? 
 (O.C.) What's he got there? 
. 
 (O.S.) (sarcastic) I can see turning you loose was a great idea. 
 (O.S.) YOU happened, jackass. You wanted control, you got it. 
 (O.S.) Yeah, that's right. So please don't fuck up... 
 (O.S.) What's the matter with you Kable? Kill something! 
. 
 (O.S.) (frustrated) Fuck it. 
. 
 (O.S.) Dammit! 
... 
. 
 (O.S.) Kable. Dude. What are you doing? 
 Fuuuuck!!!! 
 (O.S.) Kable, PLEASE... get back in the game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS, KABLE!!! 
 Um. 
 Shit, shit, SHIT! 
. 
 Please stand by... Please stand by... Please stand by... 
 What just happened? 
 She's not home. 
 You asked me that once before. 
 You should really come with me... 
... 
 Hang on. 
... 
 You a fool. 
 Stop playing that freaky shit off the rail. 
 It's a game of deception. 
 Whatever, that's cuz you got no power... 
 Bullshit. 
 (impressed) Kable. Holy shit. 
 His name's Tillman. 
 Whatever. (to KABLE) You made it. You're really here. 
 We only freed your mind. 
 Your ass followed. 
 Hey, Kable... 
 (to Kable) You got questions. 
 The nanex modifies the actual cell structure of your brain... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 Because Castle's scared of you. 
 It ain't just a game, you know, Tillman. Everyday there's more people steppin forward, wanna be a part of Castle's world. Throwing away everything it means to be human. 
 Right now it's the desperate ones... convicts, addicts... the sick, the poor... the ones that fell through the cracks... they have no choice. 
 But this is only the beginning. 
 Think about it: the federal prison system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn USA... Castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line. 
 So what's next? The health care system is collapsing - Castle comes to the rescue again... 
 This time he's pushin total control of genetic disease... birth defects a thing of the past... all we gotta do is exchange our cells for the ones he wanna give us. 
 The promise of a longer life and a fatter wallet - you think people will refuse? 
 Hell no. 
 They'll be standing in line to hand their babies over to him. Next thing you know, we all slaves. 
 We can't let that happen. 
 Gotta bring the man down. 
 You can help us, Tillman. (with urgency) You have to help us. 
 Tillman. 
 Guess you remember that day. 
 Good times. 
 Sure. On the outside.        Now look at these. 
 Yeah, um... I need something too. 
 (ice cold) Do you now? And what might that be? 
 Could you dudes do a sandwich like: peanut butter, almond butter, walnut butter... pecan butter, pistachio butter... pretty much any kind of, you know, nut butter. And Welch's grape. 
 Pistachio. They make that? 
 It's awesome. 
 The usual? 
 Hi Nika. 
 Oh. Hi. Rick Rape, right? 
 That was just last month. I was a bad boy. 
 Are you still a bad boy? 
. 
 Urkk. 
 -. 
 GORGE/ANGIE Please don't kill me. 
) God damn it... YOU - in there... controlling her... let her talk, motherfucker. 
 GORGE/ANGIE I can't. 
 GORGE/ANGIE I love you too. 
 (friendly) Hi, Kable. 
. 
 (to ANGIE) Anybody in there? 
 GORGE/ANGIE Come on... do it... 
... 
: 
... 
... 
. 
 (shrugs) The crack works - you're the proof... we put the DNA in the soup, light it up, extract it - then feed my girl's sequence into the code and we're good to go. 
 Basically. We can't quarantine the foreign cells per se but we can disable their ability to transmit and receive. 
 That would be like cutting out part of your brain. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 We're going to have to keep her sedated until we can kill the link... otherwise she's broadcasting everything she sees or hears. 
 Thirty minutes... you give us a robot, we give you back a super hot human. 
 Tillman. 
 Come on. 
 (V.O.) Ken Castle made his first billion designing virtual reality simulators for the US military. Six years ago he brought them something new - a breakthrough so profound, he said, that history would be divided up between everything before and everything that came after. 
 The second was you. 
 (nods) Nine weeks later Scotch was dead and you were serving life in maximum. Castle's project was shut down... but the shit wasn't a total loss: the same technology resurfaced within a year... in a game. Castle called it society. 
 Dig me, Tillman. Whatever happened in that project is something Castle wanna be buried. We need that shit, baby: what you saw, what you know. 
 You ain't gotta tell me shit, Tillman. (beat) I want you to show me. 
 (O.C.) Alright. We're ready to rock. 
. 
. 
 Hooz there? 
 Tech support. 
 His memories... translated as raw audiovisual data. 
 Current exponential rate of growth, I can't imagine a piece of tech that will take that long to come around. 
 Tillman. Never thought I'd be so glad to see your ugly grille. 
 (mimicking him) Scotch. (back in character) I'll tell you what man: this place sucks. 
 (to KABLE, grinning) They got me hooked up to computers five hours a day... nurses feeding me vitamins, giving me shots, wiping my butt - male nurses, I might add... 
 What about you? You're dressed like a semi-human being... they let you out already? 
 (confused) OK. (beat) Tillman... dude. Are you good? 
 Uh huh. You don't look good. 
 (hesitant, making light) Well, it's not like you ever looked that good... 
 (freaked) Tillman... 
 Who are you? 
 - 
 Not the best commercial for K-soft technology. 
 (bitter) He made him do it.       Castle made him do it. 
 A test. 
 I missed you... so much... 
                                             * I couldn't stop them.                                       * 
 (O.C.) Nobody could.                                                * 
 I'm sorry, Tillman. Guess he needed an insurance policy. (long BEAT) She's with Castle. 
. 
 (O.C.) Alright, Silverton. Get up and get out. 
 Cool. 
 (sarcastic) Yeah, ain't it? Looks like someone up the chain decided you're no longer a threat. 
 
 No link... no link. 
. 
! 
. 
 (O.S.) Not bad for video, eh? 
. 
 (genuinely stoked) You're awesome. 
 Kable. 
 I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is... 
. 
 But mine's different. (taps his FOREHEAD) Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in... (taps KABLE'S forehead ) your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do it. 
 You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me. 
... 
 (pleasant) I think you're missing the point, my man. 
 Neglected to mention: my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy, once we had access to their drives... 
 (on SCREEN) Come on, lets boogie woogie rock and roll. 
 Ummm. 
 Biggest, baddest Slayer in the game... don't seem like much, does he? 
 Just like last time. Remember? 
 There are 2 networks accessing the same IP address. 
 Someone on the outside is sending him commands... 
 (panicking) JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN 
! 
 (irritated) Working on it... 
 (like he's explaining the obvious to a child) I think it. 
 (blank) Oops. 
 (triumphant) 
!!! 
 Sorry. 
 Are you my Daddy Tillman? 
 Pardon? 
 True dat. 
 Mommy. Why did Daddy Tillman hurt Daddy Ken?

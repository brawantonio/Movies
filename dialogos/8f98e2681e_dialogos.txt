 Leave the windows alone. What's the matter with you? 
 It's a smile, that's all. 
 I'm cracking up. 
 
 
 Gave her away. 
 What? 
 Gave her away. David Glazer said she was death.. So, I said if you like the way she looks, take her.

 Where's Elyse? 
 Talking with your wife about the fucking wedding plans. 
 Gettin' cold feet? 
 They've never been warn. Boogie is talking with DLANE, the young eleventh grader that Fenwick had the falling out with. She is an attractive petite girl with large breasts. 
 How can you take Glazer over the Fen? 
 'Cause. r4' BOOGIE Diane, did you know that Glazer bought you for five bucks? That's the kinda guy he is.

 Diane, I'm in law school at night, I have to go home and study. I just stopped by here, 'cause I appreciate fine music. 
 I thought you worked in a beauty parlor. 
 I do during the day. - (he puts his hand up and strokes her

 Elyse feels that Eddie is getting very sensitive about the wedding. 
 I k:_ow. We were talking about it. 
 _ _ _ _ She thinks that since he never talked it over with Billy beforehand, it kind of bothers him even more. 
 The closest of the close. You t-_.ow Billy's flying in this morning? 
 I didn't hear about it. Thought he was just coming in for the wedding day. 
 We didn't want to mention it. Surprise for Eddie. Shrevie's car follows in the taillights of Boogie's car. Fenwick's car is nowhere in sight. 
 Elyse's mother is very upset with Eddie. They picked out a yellow and white motif for the wedding. You know, like we did, tablecloth, napkins, maids-,of-honor. Anyway, Eddie objected. He wanted blue and white because that's The Colts' colors. Refused to give in. 
7E Yeah, so? 
 Well, you know how stubborn Eddie is . 
 SHP_-VIE Could be worse. It could be black and gold. Steelers' colors. Shrevie notices Boogie's taillights come or.. He slows down. Something is wrong up ahead. f EXT. ?.CADSIDE - NIGHT Fenwick's car is turned over. The headlights of the car shine brightly against a tree.

 That's true. There's hardly any blues in movies. Just sidekicks. 
 C'mon, they could've put Mathis in 'From Here to Eternity.' They had blues in the war.

 Fait accompli, my ass. He walks. 
 Botton line? Elyse turns into -- - Iceland and Eddie's not the type to look elcev.here. Eddie goes for the marriage, and Elyse is back to being the Bahamas again.

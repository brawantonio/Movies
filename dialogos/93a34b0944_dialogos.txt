 – 1965 
. 
 FATHER 0'NEAL (sternly) Sumeria. And what happened to him Francis? 
 Jesus' disciples came and performed miracles. When Simon Magus saw the miracles he offered disciple Peter gold for the powers of God. 
 FATHER 0'NEAL What did disciple Peter say to that? Michael Quinn? 
." 
 FATHER 0'NEAL Answer the question Michael. 
 That's not my name. 
 Why one child is born into a good home and another into poverty - that is but part of God's design. All of you are unwanted, put here because of the sins of your unwedded mothers. The church has fed you and educated you. Given you a home. A name. An identity. 
 Who is that, boy? 
 Father Michael Quinn. 
 Yes. A great man. You ungrateful little cur, you will sit here without food until you appreciate your namesake. (to the other boys) All of you will sit with him. Put lunch away, Mr. Fong. 
 What is your name, boy? 
 Put supper away, Mr. Fong. 
 Spareth the rod, spoileth the child. 
 Put breakfast away, Mr. Fong. 
 Stop. You'll have your breakfast. 
 They should've named you Simon, like Simon Magus the sorcerer. 
 No. Simon. . . . (pulls the "KNIGHTS TEMPLAR" paperback from his back pocket) ...Templar. 
 Who.. . who did this...? The boys look at Michael Quinn. Then Francis speaks: 
 I did father. And another boy, James: 
 I did father. . 
 In 1987 Gorbachev stood here and promised a new age. The result? An end to communism. Democracy. A free economy. And what else? Chaos. (crowd CHEERS) The economy run by criminals, the government run by charlatans. And they are in league together! Thieves! Traitors! (louder CHEERS) Men and women of St. Petersburg, citizens of Russia, the salt of this country, this must end! (deafening CHEERS) Join me then in the song of our forefathers. Romanov begins to sing, ably, the first verse of "Mother Russia" (the Russian anthem before the Bolsheviks). 
 (on t.v.) An extraordinary allegation, Bernard, that Russia's present leadership, including President Victor Karpov, is connected with the country's underworld. 
 Ladies. Gentlemen. The Myaki Corporation looks forward to many profitable days ahead. To our new manufacturing facility in St. Petersburg. To the new Russia! 
 (on t.v.) One thing's certain, Bernard: Michael Romanov, age 32, French born and Oxford educated, descendent of the last czar, is a political force to be reckoned with. 
. 
 Sorry about this. 
. 
 Compliments of Mr. Myaki. 
 (delighted) Ahh! 
 Sorry again. 
 On your knees. (Templar sinks to his knees) Give me the box. Slowly. 
 Sound the alarm! Call the police! 
 The box please. 
 I tried to stop him! He went out the window! 
 Newspaper sir? 
 (Cockney) Wow, are those gorgeous or what... 
 You have an eye for beauty. Of course - you see it every time you look in the mirror. 
 Why thank-you, Mr... (reads seat assignment) Templar. 
 Goodbye, goodbye, enjoy your stay in London, etc. 
 Good-bye, Mr. Templar. 
 How's the weather in St. Petersburg? 
 Cold. 
 Let's warm things up for you. 
 He's clean. 
 (to MacDuff) Careful with that. It's delicate equip... 
 . . . ment. 
 Yes. Very. 
 It's for protection. I deal in antique.... 
 (snaps) I know what you deal in. And these? Your pajamas? 
 For jogging. My doctor's recommended five miles a... 
 Sit down and shut it. 
 He's licensed to carry, Inspector. 
 Let's see the passport. (Baker hands MacDuff Templar's passport) What's your nationality this week, Templar? 
 I forget. 
 (looks at passport) Issued by the Principality of.. . Yemen? You're bloody joking. 
 (shrugs) Call the embassy 
 Shut it. 
 You pass through Russia for a day with that gear and, what a surprise, a prototype computer chip worth quarter of a billion quid is nicked from the Myaki Corporation the night you arrive. We know you didn't fence it in Russia. Where is it? 
 (Cockney) All negative. He didn't swallow it. 
 You've got three options: charge me, or release me. 
 What's the third. 
 You can kiss my ass. 
 I'm a busy man. Make up your mind. 
 .. . then me mum says, call uncle Charlie, he's in the airline business, there's jobs there, good benefits too, and.. ..where was I? 
 How you got your job. 
 Right! (hiccups, giggles) 'Scuze me. 
 Another round please. 
 Ye're tryin' ta get me drunk, aren't you? Are you cute or what? I gotta freshen up. (she rises) Where's the loo in 'ere? 
 Back there. Leave your locket. I'll polish it for you. 
 Are you a dearheart or what... 
 Maam, where's the gent who was sitting 'ere? 
 He left, luv. Said you'd take care of the bill. 
 What? 
 Thanks Harry. Oh, and Harry... (pulls out the envelope with the computer chip) .. . ship this by overnight courier to that address. 
 They're all he ever brings. The man's bills are paid by a bank in Switzerland and his mailing address is a corporation in Lisbon. Bloody strange... 
 Yes. 
 Is this Simon Templar? 
 It depends. 
 A meeting. Midnight, Blackfriars Bridge. 
 Involving what? 
 A lot of money. If you want it. 
 Harry, I'm going for a walk over Blackfriars Bridge. Midnight. 
 Very good, sir. 
 Jimmy (Jimmy walks over) It's about time I taught you how to run the front desk. 
 Interesting. (sizes up Templar) You are not a big man. But men like you never are. It is my pleasure, Simon Templar. My name is... 
 I know who you are. Tell me what you want, or I keep walking. 
 Suppose I don't want anything. Suppose I want to kill you. 
 Suppose there's a high-powered rifle trained at your head. 
 Rumour has not lied about you, Mr. Templar. Last night something was stolen in St. Petersburg. My city. 
 You talk about the place as if you own it. 
 (sinisterly) I do, Mr. Templar. May I ask who hired you? 
 You can ask. I won't answer. 
 What you stole I wanted very badly. (beat) Ilya. 
 What is the saying - if you can't beat them, why not join them? An American phrase, no? Or are you British? Australian? 
 I'm nothing. Except bored. Get to the point. 
 (smiles) Of course. An American scientist has worked ten years to develop a certain technology. I am informed that the technology will be made public at the annual nuclear science symposium in Washington D.C. I would like the plans and specifications for this technology. Before the symposium. 
 What are we talking about? 
 A nuclear fusion generator. We have a man on the inside. 
 Why can't he steal it? 
 He's tried. The scientist trusts no one and keeps no hard records of the technology in the lab. 
 Nuclear fusion. They say it's mankind's only hope after all the oil's gone. This guy's actually done it? 
 She. 
 Come again? 
 She, Mr. Templar. The scientist is a woman. (hands over a dossier) Her dossier. All the information you will need. 
 My fee is fifteen million U.S. dollars, half up front, half when I deliver. You'll hear from me. 
 Templar, one question. 
 I ask you to steal a person's entire life's work. You have no reaction. Are you that cold? 
 No, rumor hasn't lied about you, Templar. 
 (reads ingredients) Filtered water, high fructose corn syrup. Lemon juice concentrate. Citric acid. Gum acacia...? (grumbles) Totally natural, yeah right. 
 Try this. (smiles) Sorry, I overheard. (hands her the bottle) The real thing. No chemicals, no preservatives. 
 Thanks. 
 Hello again. These aren't ripe. How are the apples? 
 Excellent. They're in season. 
 I wonder why He didn't want us to eat these. 
 Who? 
 God. In the Garden of Eden. 
 Oh right. Sorry, little slow today. Bad headache. (looks at the apple) Uhm, actually, I don't know. 
 Why wasn't it: "No bananas." Or: "Avoid, at all cost, kumquats." Wonder what God had against apples. She gives him a funny look and turns away. 
 Sorry. Can't help you. 
 How about William Tell? You really think he shot one of these off his brother's head with an arrow? 
 Do I know you? 
 Unlikely. I just moved to New York. 
 Well uhhm, sir, to answer your apple questions, one, I don't know what God's problem was. Two, William Tell, like Paul Bunyon, never existed. And in case you're wondering, Isaac Newton discovered gravity through planetary observation not because one of those fell on his head, and I seriously doubt that eating one a day will keep the doctor away. (beat) Okay? 
 By the way - welcome to the Big Apple. 
 No, really? Moron. 
 C'mon, Dr. Singh. Tell me something I don't know. 
 Just keep driving. 
 Hello! She walks up to him. Together they look down at THE REAR TIRE. It's flat, a pancake. 
 Where's the spare? 
 I.. .well.. .I'm not really certain. 
 You do know how to change a tire. 
 Sorry. (beat) I'm not very... mechanical. 
 Give me your keys. 
 (sheepish) Sorry. 
 All right, where do you live? 
 Close. 
 It's your lucky day. (begins to walk off) Come on. 
 Try room temperature, idiot. The Tokamak's got it all backwards. 
 Uhhm. Excuse me. Who is that? 
 Him? A powerful, well-respected man who doesn't know a goddarnn thing what he's talking about. If I got one tenth of his funding... 
 It's the next left. First driveway on the right. 
 You live here? (turns to him) Are you for real? 
 Like the label says. No chemicals, no preservatives. 
 (points at the house) You work for this or inherit it? 
 My father made shoes. I inherited the company. Now I make shoes. 
 (looks at the house) That's a helluva lot of shoes. 
 Uhm listen, I'm not very good at this and I realize we just met, but I'm even-tempered, politically moderate, belong to no religious cults, have no children I know of, am free of communicable diseases, I happen to find you attractive... 
 Wait a minute, hold on. Are you asking me out on a date? 
 Yes. 
 How do you know I'm not married? 
 I believe the fourth finger on your left hand is... 
 (quickly) Okay so I'm not married. I could have a boyfriend. 
 I'd be surprised if you didn't have several. 
 Be surprised. Lemme give you a hand. 
 What about you? There's no wife stashed on some island someplace? 
 No wife stashed on some island. 
 No mistress? C'mon. No bimbo on the side? 
 Not a one. 
 Well, that's a start. Here's the deal with me: I am not particularly even-tempered, I'm staunchly liberal, belong to no religious cults but I do believe in God as a basic force of good, have no children because one has to have sex to do that and, well, let's not pursue that, am free of communicable diseases, see above, and you're an attractive man, if a little weird, and well.. .hell, why not. (smiles) You've got a date, shoemaker. What's your name? 
 Michael. Michael Quinn. 
 I'm Jillian St. Thomas. 
 I'll give you my number. 
 Just say it. I have a good memory. 
 (looks at him) Eight seven seven, five two nine eight. 
 Good. Great. I'll call you. 
 I've heard that before. 
 I will call you. You saved me today. Thanks again. 
 Hey. (Templar turns) What's my number? 
 (without hesitation) Eight seven seven, five two nine eight. 
 And he has a brain. What do you know. 
 I am not eccentric. 
 No? You live in the biggest house in America but do your own shopping, you talk to strange women about the history of apples, and you give a first-time date.. . shoes? Isn't the tradition flowers? 
 You said you liked them. 
 I do. I'm joking. They're beautiful. Thank-you. 
 (to the waiter) What happened? 
 (smiles) He just asked her to marry him. Anything else? 
 Just the check please. (the waiter exits; Jillian looks at him) You didn't answer my question. Maybe it made you uncomfortable. Maybe I should just shut up... 
 No, it's all right. Okay: "Why Jillian never got married, chapter One:" I don't know where you're from. . . 
 Canada. 
 I don't know what it's like there, but here, if a teenage girl doesn't want to be a cheerleader, or drink 'till she pukes every weekend, or talk endlessly on the phone every night about absolutely nothing, then she doesn't win many popularity contests, know what I mean? That pretty much took care of highschool. 
 College? 
 Try earning double p.h.d.'s from Harvard before you turn twenty-three and having a social life. 
 Can I ask a personal question? (she nods) What's your I.Q.? 
 (laughs) That's personal? My I.Q.? Let's just say it's high. 
 Very high. 
 Yes, very high. As high as yours. 
 You don't honestly mean that. 
 Oh, you're a smart one, shoemaker. It's in the eyes. I can always tell. 
 I just don't often get the opportunity. It feels nice. 
 For me, too. (and he means this:) You're very pretty. 
 Stop it. Flattery will get you... someplace. I don't know where yet. 
 No no no, absolutely not. Put that away. 
 It's not for us. It's for the couple over there. (points at the couple across the room) Waiter, put their bill on my card please. 
 Maam? Are you sure? 
 I'll make the booze. Turn on the news. I want to catch up on that Russia thing. 
 Scotch please. No ice. 
 What brand? 
 That country's going to explode. 
 It very well might. Oban. 
 What? . 
 My brand of scotch. Oban. Have any? 
 No, but there's a liquor store five minutes away. 
 Wait. Don't be ridiculous. 
 I want to be ridiculous. (pause) Michael, I haven't had anybody over in...a long time. And I happen to like you. I want to do this right. Okay? (he smiles; nods) I'll be back in ten minutes. (points at fireplace) Build a fire. 
 You're making this too easy, dear. 
 Then this appears: RETRIEVAL CODE: _____________________ 
 Smart girl. Send your data into cyberspace and only you can retrieve it. Because only you have the code. 
 
: ______________________ 
 Goodnight Jillian. 
 ‘Night, Walter. 
. 
 Okay, think. Think. 
 
 Try room temperature, idiot. The Tokamak's got it all backwards. 
. 
 Open sesame. 
 That was quick. 
 Now Mr. Michael Quinn, let's have that scotch. Hey, what happened to the fire? 
 I thought we'd create our own. 
 (smiles) Down boy. 
 Whoah whoah whoah, time to put on the brakes. Those lips oughtta be licensed buddy... 
 Sorry. I wasn't trying to... 
 I know you weren't but if we keep going I'm gonna be the one who gets us both in trouble. Whew! (fans herself) Haven't felt like that for awhile. (she brushes a lock of hair from his eyes) Am I going to see you again? 
 Michael? 
 (smiles at her) How about breakfast? 
 It's a date. I'll walk you out, shoemaker. 
 Good-night. 
 'Bye. Drive safe. 
 Where is Russia's capital? Moscow? The Kremlin? No, Russia's capital is... (points at mansion) THROUGH THOSE GATES! (crowd CHEERS) A den of thieves! 
 And here - the Prince of Thieves! 
 Every citizen in St. Petersburg knows what that man does, yet the police don't arrest him. They protect him! How can this be? Maybe we should ask our elected whores in Moscow! 
 There's a problem. 
 (indicates computer) This is the data your thief sent us. 
 (confused) Cold fusion? 
 Yes. Fusion at room temperature.  Regarded as an impossibility by the scientific community. A myth. (smiles) Then I read this. 
 She first proves why hot fusion - the tokamak - is impractical. You must heat the hydrogen gases so high, more energy is wasted than created. Here she goes into the benefits of cold fusion. (scrolls more pages) The hydrogen isotopes needed. (scrolls more pages) The physical plant. She even estimates its cost. Extraordinary. (scrolls more pages) The next pages are the critical part, what no one in fifty years has discovered. (looks up at Tretiak) The combination of chemicals in which atoms will fuse at room temperature. 
 Well? Let's see. 
 Tretiak - I think from reading this that the woman's done it. She may have found a source of unlimited energy. 
 What do you mean may have. Show me. 
 I said there was a problem. Zubov hits the "scroll" key. The next page appears; we see the heading at the top of the page: THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION 
 Where's the rest of it? 
 It's in her head. 
 Good morning, boss. Where are you going? 
 To see a friend. Be back in a couple hours. 
 Doctor St. Thomas' residence. 
 May I help you? (beat) Do you have an appointment? 
 A what? 
 To see the house. 
 The man who lives here... who owns the house... 
 What man. The estate is rented for weddings and corporate events. Are you. ..interested...? 
 No. No. 
 Oh my god. ... 
 Varig Air flight 157 to Rio de Janeiro, departing at 8 a.m, boarding now from gate seventeen. 
 The supermarket, the flat tire, all a set-up. You fool. You fool. (calls down the hall) Yuri! 
 No.. . .. 
 No, this can't be happening. Yuri! (turns, calling) 
! 
 Yes. 
 Sure. Black please. 
 Thanks. 
 Well, that's me. So long. 
 Excuse me, that's my. . . . 
 That's a Reuger nine shot. I counted nine. 
 What if you're wrong. 
 When were you hired and for what? 
 Okay. Take it easy. I was hired a week ago to take you and the woman out, and detonate the house. It was empty when I got here. 
 Who's your employer? 
 I don't ask names. 
 Did they have accents? Russian? (she nods; he lowers his gun) I'm paying you out of your contract. Don't ask questions. What's your price? 
 Fifty thousand for you, fifty for her, fifty for the house. 
 U.S. bearer bonds.  Good as cash. 
 About the airport - no offense you understand. 
 None taken. Go and don't come back. 
 (dawning on him) A. . . .plane. Indeed, Simon Templar, a plane. 
 Your ticket. What'd you pay for it? 
 I'll give you twenty grand for it. Cash. Right now. (they stop) I need to get on that plane. 
 Remy! Telephone. 
 (IN ENGINE COWLING) Oui. Un moment. 
 Merci, Coco. (Coco walks off) Remy Samarkand Aeronautique, Remy Samarkand. 
 (smiles) Anything for Simon Templar... 
 IT'S A LITTLE JET, MAYBE A TURBO PROP. ENTERED SCOTLAND FIVE MINUTES AGO, GO ING TO ST. PETERSBURG. CAN WE GET TO IT BEFORE THEN? 
 OUI . OVER FINLAND. 
 What are you smuggling these days? 
 Oh, things. How long has it been – two year? Three? Now tell me: what's so important about this plane? 
 Fifteen million dollars of my money. (picks up cellular phone) And a score to settle. 
 Ja. 
 Simon? Where are you? 
 Unimportant. How soon can you be in St. Petersburg? 
 Five hours. What type of job? 
 Eyes and ears. Two hundred thousand cash for two days work. 
 Who's the mark? 
 Gregor Tretiak. His headquarters. His office in particular. 
 Gregor Tretiak is not a very nice man, Simon. Four hundred thousand. 
 Deal. Now listen, Frankie... 
 We're over Helsinki. Yuri wakes, sits upright. Yawns. 
 Simon, there! 
 They're descending. 
 The St. Petersburg tower wants us to circle. 
 No. Follow them down. 
 What do we do when we land? 
 Haven't figured that out yet. 
 (Russian, subtitled) Prepare for landing. 
 Simon. 
 We have a problem. 
 Don't! 
 Remy... 
 I get ten grand for them in Paris. Maybe a Russian would pay more? 
 Put down in Helsinki and wait for my call! 
 Help me. I'm American. Police! 
 Sorry about this. 
 Do you speak English? 
 Thank God. (takes a deep breath, composes herself) I'm an American scientist. Last night, in New York, a man stole something from me, then this morning I was kidnapped by my lab assistant, god this sounds like a bad novel . . . . . 
 What was that? 
 (Russian) Is this her? 
 (Russian) Yes sir Sergeant Ravik. 
 What...? WHO...? 
 (Russian) (pointing back at the police sedan) Help them! 
 Who are you. Tell me who you are and what the hell is going on. 
 I was hired to steal your research, but you know that by now. You left the critical data off the disk. Where is it? memorized, right? (she doesn't answer) That's a bad cut. Here. 
 Look, you're in big trouble. The guy who hired me will do anything to get your research. Once he has it, you're a corpse. Give me the missing data and I'll get you out of here. You can trust me. 
 Trust you? (chews the word) Trust you...? 
 Damn it, don't be stupid...! 
 
! 
 There could be another solution. The woman is not-the only scientist working in this field. Is she? 
 No. There are others. 
 Get on a plane. Leave tonight. 
 Gracha is here. 
 This had better be important. It's my wife's birthday. 
 My apologies to your wife. 
 An apology from Tretiak? An historic moment. 
 (placating) Come now, Ivan, why must we feud. 
 We feud because we hate each other. 
 It is true there have been harsh words between us. We are rivals. But rivalry is bad for business. Upon what conditions would you accept a partnership? Be reasonable. 
 Fifty percent of the drug trade in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling. 
 Agreed. (they shake hands) I need the men in your areas, Ivan, for two days. Particularly Moscow and points South. 
 Why? 
 To find this woman... and kill this man. 
 (smiles) This is a private matter, I take it. (Tretiak smiles) Then you'll have them. 
 Ilya - some wine for Ivan Gracha. 
 What is this, Tretiak? 
 Put your guns down. 
 What was that? 
 Simon. Good news. 
 They haven't found her and they don't know where she is. 
 She's on a train to Moscow. 
 That's bad news. They're 'stopping every train leaving the city. 
 Call you later, Frankie. 
 We're going to jump. Okay? 
 You can't get rid of me. 
 Like a bad flu. 
 Pretty smart, selling the clothes and watch. You were going for the U.S. embassy, weren't you? 
 Present tense please – I am going. Before we discuss the present, let's discuss the past. 
 Who the hell are you. I want full name, address, profession, and don't - don't - say Michael Quinn of 112 Mason Street, shoemaker. 
 My name is Simon Templar. I don't have an address because I live in hotels. I'm a professional thief. 
 Good. We're getting somewhere. I'd like to respond to that. 
 You wicked man. (slaps him again. You liar. (slaps him again) Thief. 
 I hope you rot in hell. 
 Where are you going? 
 As far away from you as I can. 
 Sit down. 
 You're joking. 
 Michael Quinn jokes. I don't. 
 Remy. Be at Moscow Airport at eight a.m., fueled and ready to go. 
 We're going to sit here and not make a scene. I'd get some rest. Templar leans back, shutting his eyes. 
 I sleep light. 
 Dr. Singh? Dr. Vijay Singh? 
 Who are you and what do you want? 
 My name is Vapin Zubov. I would like to discuss something with... 
 (scowls) Come back at a decent hour... 
 I would like to discuss cold fusion, Doctor. Dr. Singh's demeanor changes. Pushes open the door. 
 Come in. 
 Thirty minutes to Moscow, thirty minutes... 
 I need to use the ladies' room. I think you can trust me to... 
 I don't trust anybody. 
 Tell me something. How much were you paid? 
 It's not your business. Move. 
 I think it is. C'mon. Tell me. 
 Fifteen million dollars, but it didn't work out. Did it. 
 Does it bother you? What you do? 
 No. 
 You have no conscience? No sense of morality? 
 Define morality. 
 It's a commonly used and generally understood word. 
 Not by me. . 
 Wait. 
 You are not going in there with me. 
 Okay, how about: Do unto others as they would do unto you. 
 How about: Do unto others before they do unto you. 
 How about: love thy neighbor. 
 The man who said that was crucified by his. 
 Were you raised by wolves? Who were your parents, Lucretia Borgia and the Marquis de Sader 
 The two people in question weren't as nice as that. I wouldn't know. I never met them. Are you through? It's all yours. 
 International operator please. (pause) The American Embassy in Moscow, please. 
 You really will rot in hell, know that? 
 Good, all my friends will be waiting for me. They move down the aisle, passing the SERVING PORTER, Jillian's hand dangles over the fruit and cheese cart. She plucks up a SERVING KNIFE with two fingers and slides it up her sleeve. 
 Friends? I thought you trusted no one. 
 I don't. Give it to me. 
 (innocently) What. 
 The knife you just took. 
. JILLIAN continues down the aisle, sweating it out. If the guy discovers that his phone is missing... 
 I'm so sorry! 
 Moscow Station, Moscow Station! 
 Give me a second, will you? I don't feel well. 
 Make it quick. 
 Just a second. 
 Porter, I seem to have lost my letter opener... 
 Ms. St. Thomas? Jillian? 
 Yes. 
 John Whitehead, Special Agent, Central Intelligence Agency. Was your trip all right? 
 Yes it was fine, oh who cares, I'm finally safe... (squeezes his hand) Do you have a car? 
 Yes, outside. First I'd like to ask you some questions. That was an interesting story you told the embassy. 
 Interesting? It's true. 
 Please understand: the United States Embassy receives fifty calls a day. My husband's been murdered, my daughter's been sold into white slavery, you get the idea. So before we waste a lot of people's time, Ms. St. Thomas, you say you have p.h.d.s in chemistry and nuclear physics. What's the atomic symbol for, say. ..gold? 
 You've gotta be kidding me... 
 Talk to me, Frankie. 
 She called the U.S. Embassy a half hour ago. 
 What? (considers this) Does Tretiak know? 
 Simon, the U.S. Embassy has more leaks than a Polish submarine. Who do you think intercepted the call? 
 Thanks, Frankie. 
 Simon, wait. . . . 
. 
 Hail Michael Romanov, Czar of the Fatherland. How will that sound to the average Russian? 
 (a whisper) I don't believe it... 
 . ..Cd, that's big "C" little "d," cadmium's valence is 2, its atomic number is 48 and its atomic weight is 112.411 or would you like that carried out five more decimal places? Good enough? 
 (smiles) Good enough. Come this way, Ms. St. Thomas. He ushers her off. 
 (shakes her head) What a nightmare.. To think my work could just be taken from me... 
 You're safe now, Doctor St. Thomas. We'll have you back in New York in no time. They continue toward the parked Mercedes. 
 Agent Whitehead... 
 Yes? 
 Ms. St. Thomas? You had a question? 
 Nothing, I was just thinking that when my research was stolen I felt like the Buffalo Bills after they lost four World Series. 
 Hah hah, I bet you did. I'm a baseball fan too hah hah... 
 Go! 
 TAKE ME TO THE EMBASSY. 
 We're going to the airport. 
 Good. 
 Is it? Who's worse – them or you? 
 Fifteen block radius. Go house to house. 
 The embassy's surrounded. 
 The airport's out. They're drawing a noose around us. We don't have much time. 
 What are you going to do? Tell me.  I deserve at least that. (desperate now) I'll die. If you take their offer, they'll kill me. 
 And if I don't, they'll kill me. Interesting situation I'd say. 
 Oh god. It's over, it's all over...  You're not human. You're an animal. 
 I'm a businessman. I perform services for profit. And spare me the lecture. You didn't spend ten years in that mildewed basement for the good of humanity, you did it to get rich. Richer than anyone on earth. Richer than God. (beat) I'll make you an offer - pay me my fifteen million out of your royalties - should come to about one month's. . . 
 I don't hold the patent rights to cold fusion. 
 What? 
 You fool. Don't you understand? (her voice cracks; she begins to softly cry) It wasn't about money, it wasn't about becoming rich... 
 If you don't own the patent rights, who does? 
 A foundation in my name. The royalties were going to go to scientific research, curing cancer, .. .christ how can you understand this... 
 That's a municipal water main. In one hour you're going in there. 
 Listen. They shut it down twice a day for five minutes to clean the filters. Once at noon, once at midnight. Noon is in one hour. 
 How do you know all this? 
 Part of my job. Now ask the logical question... 
 .. . where does it go? 
 Very good. Under the United States Embassy. There's an exit hatch into the embassy courtyard. That's where we're going. 
 We...? 
 You heard me. 
 Then what happens? 
 Let's get to the embassy, then we'll talk about it. 
 Templar - about that night at my house… 
 Don't talk about it, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Jesus H. Christ. 
 Right on time. 
 Four blocks. Right under Tretiak's men and up into the embassy compound. You can do this. She grabs Templar's hand. He pulls her up and inside -- 
 It doesn't seem like we've gone far enough. 
 We haven't, up there's the street in front of the embassy. (looks at his wristwatch) Come on. We've got two minutes. 
 There it is. 
 Oh my god... 
 We. ...we've got to go back. 
 (checks his watch) Not enough time. (thinks) The hatch under the street. 
 What about Tretiak's men … 
 Better than drowning. 
 The water's back on! 
 City gas line. 
 We can't stay here, we'll asphyxiate. 
 Both of us will never make it. But one of us can. (draws his gun) Give me ten seconds, then break for the embassy and don't stop running until you're at the gates. It's a hundred yards, so move it. 
 What are you going to... 
 That's my business. 
 Wait... (he stops) .. .Simon. Don't do this. They'll kill you. 
 The world can do without Simon Templar. It can't do without you. (smiles grimly) See you around sometime. 
 Kill him! 
 What the hell is going on. 
 . . . nine. . . . TEN. . . . 
 Go. Faster.. . . 
 Open the gate! 
 Do it. 
 I'm an American citizen. 
 You have our full protection ma'am. (looks at Ilya) Back away from the gate. 
 Do something! 
 That's Russian soil out there, ma'am. 
 Simon, where the hell are you... You want me to do what? 
 DR. SINGH Yes. (beat) Yes. (beat) Yes, yes. . . . . (looks up) I will give you a list of the things I will need.  I request solitude.  Remove those men. (turns back to Jillian's document) Leave me now. Please. 
 No. (beat) No. (beat) No. 
 -- 
 One more. 
 Be certain, Ms. St. Thomas. Look again. 
 I'm certain. It's not him. 
 They showed me photographs of criminals. (beat) And a photograph of you. 
 And...? 
 I said that the man in the photograph doesn't have the eyes of a criminal. (pause; they stare at each other) The Washington symposium is tomorrow afternoon.  I'm going. I'm presenting my research to the scientific community. 
 What about your data... 
 It's in my head. I'll wing it. 
 (draws closer to her) You need to conduct further research anyway. I'll help you. 
 What are we researching. ..? 
 The benefits of warm fusion. 
 It is in the eyes.  You're not bad. 
 Being bad is the only thing I've ever been good at. 
 You can be good at being good. (she strokes his hair) If you're afraid of the dark, remember the night rainbow.  If tomorrow morning the sky falls, have clouds for breakfast.  If the birds forget their songs, listen to the wind. And if between right and wrong, do what is right. 
 Who said that? 
 (smiles privately) My grandmother. 
 How did I meet you.  This saint. (smiles) Saint Thomas. 
 DR. SINGH Zinc oxide. Iridium mercurate. Sodium bicarbon nitrate. A cobalt magnesium isotope. Liquify the cobalt at 665 degrees fahrenheit, add the magnesium. ... 
 DR. SINGH My god. It actually works. 
 1 Doctor St. Thomas! Ben Rothstein, Omni Magazine. Is it true? Have you done it? 
 That question will be answered in ten minutes, Mr. Rothstein. 
 2 Marilyn Jones, Doctor St. Thomas. Dr. Vijay Singh has said that your theories are insupportable... 
 (smiles) Sorry, but I'm not interested in Doctor Singh's opinions on this or anything else. 
 Ms. St. Thomas, Ms. St. Thomas... 
 Please, no more questions. ... 
 Hey! What's the idea? 
 Stop it! I know him! 
 Simon? What is it? 
 Are you all right? 
 Yes. (smiles) Go get a seat. 
 Good afternoon. In 1989, two physicists claimed to have perfected... (her eyelids flutter) .. .cold nuclear fusion. Their results couldn't be duplicated. ... 
 It is my pleasure to announce that I . . . . (her eyes roll back) ...have... 
 
!! ! (kneels to her) No. No. No... AMBULANCE, GET AN AMBULANCE! 
 Simon... (she's fading fast) I love you... (gasps for breath) My Saint. . . . . 
 No. . . No. . . God please no... But God won't help you, Simon Templar... ...God will take her anyway. 
 A 
 Nuclear physicist Jillian St. Thomas suffered a cerebral aneurism... 
 A 
 Death occurred at two-fifty one p.m. … 
 It is the ruling of this court that death was due to natural... 
 A 
 .. ..and foul play was ruled out. In international news, the situation in St. Petersburg worsened... 
 The scene is reminiscent of the Tiananmen Square crisis, Bernard. The death toll stands at forty-eight civilians and at least twenty-one armed forces personnel. Rumors escalated today that... 
 .. . General Nicolai Radischev... (we see a photo of Radischev) ...has promised Michael Romanov his support, pending the outcome of today's meeting between Romanov and President Karpov. 
 A nuclear bunker, Mr. President? You must worry for your safety. 
 I have reason to. 
 Yes. You do. 
 You understand my policy on taping meetings. 
 I'll get to the point. Your remarks are irresponsible; they've caused civil unrest. Unless you appeal to your supporters to stop rioting, I will institute martial law. (beat) Tell me what you want. 
 A public debate, then new elections. We'll let the people decide. 
 (considers this) Agreed. 
 The woman's death was unfortunate. You lost. I lost. To think what we could have done with her formula. But life goes on, no? 
 When Romanov gains the presidency Russia will be ours. The possibilities are, you would agree, endless. (beat) You have talent. Unique talent. I need that talent to break into an impregnable facility. Be part of this, Templar. 
 (considers this) Fifteen million, plus the fifteen you owe me. 
 I owe you nothing. You were hired to steal something and you failed. 
 Thirty million, and I use my own men. 
 Twenty million, and one of my men goes with you. 
 Templar. A question. (Templar turns) You had feelings for the woman, didn't you? 
 I don't have feelings, Tretiak. 
 No, no, no, Karpov's office is in the nuclear operations room. The entry hatch can't be activated from above - only below. 
 It's lead-lined and reinforced with eight feet of concrete. Explosives and drills are out. 
 Electronic by-pass? 
 Negative. Understand something, Simon, please: this is not a bank. This is the former Soviet Union's missile command. Forced entry is impossible. 
 What's that? 
 Uhhm.. .that is the facility's... (comes to the relevant page and reads:) ... radiation detector. In the event of nuclear fall-out it automatically closes the hatch. 
 You're saying the system can think. 
 Yes. 
 Then it can be lied to. 
 The world will continue to spend half its gross national product on oil. 
 And Russia will spend none. Within five years we will be the wealthiest nation on earth. 
 And it's leaders, Romanov, the most powerful people. 
. 
. Templar rips off the wire mesh screen.  Thirty feet below, in the recessed entrance to the nuclear situation facility, TWO NAVAL GUARDS are walking their shift. They walk around the corner. . . 
 We've got sixty seconds. Move. 
. Templar positions the plexiglass box over the radiation detector. He unpockets FOUR CONCRETE BOLTS CREWS and bolts the box tightly to the concrete floor with the cordless boltdriver. (The plexiglass box has a steel mount with holes for this purpose.) 
 Radon isn't plutonium but you don't know that... 
 Boom, you just got nuked. (unbolts the box) Now it's two months later and the radiation's gone... 
 Tell me what you want. 
 A public debate, then new elections. We'll let the people decide. 
 (considers this) Agreed. 
 Upon what conditions would you accept a partnership? Be reasonable. 
 Fifty percent of the drug trade in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling. 
 Come on, Frankie... 
 Tell me what you want. 
 Fifty percent of the drug trade in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of prostitution and gambling. 
 Agreed. 
 Should I send it? 
 Not yet. 
 General Radischev please. Yes, an emergency. 
 What's he doing? Templar won't have time to get out of there... 
 (under his breath) Mother of God... 
 Come on, Simon, move it... 
 Come on, Frankie. 
 I found him over there. (holds up the tape) With this. 
 Friends, countrymen, I give you Major Antonin Scarpinin. 
 Twenty minutes ago a team of Russian Special Forces, acting on confidential information, raided President Karpov's office... 
 Thank you for coming, Ivan, it is a great night for Russia. 
 I don't give a damn who's president. I'll make my money either way. 
 Maybe you should take greater interest in politics, Ivan Gracha. Tretiak and Gracha turn to Major Scarpinin, listening... 
 This man, a known international thief, aided by this woman, a German operative, were arrested stealing a surveillance videotape from President Karpov's office. Scarpinin shows THE SEIZED TAPE to the crowd, then hands it to Romanov, who climbs atop the tank. TEMPLAR AND FRANKIE are pulled down from the turret and led away to TWO ARMY TRUCKS in the background. 
 One month ago I said I would prove that those who call themselves our leaders... (points at KARPOV) .. .are in league with those who we know to be thieves, traitors, rapists of our once-great country. Do you want to see this proof? 
! 
 Hail Michael Romanov, Czar of the Fatherland. How will that sound to the average Russian? 
 The average Russian is a fool. 
 He exists to be dominated. To partnership in government. 
 No Romanov – to partnership in crime. 
 That.. . that it is a fraud... (turns to General Radischev) I can explain. 
 (motions to MAJOR SCARPININ) Arrest him. 
 Get Frankie. 
 Get the plane running, we'll be there in five minutes. (to his men) Clean out the safe. Burn the records in my office. 
 We reduced the fusion formula to one disk and destroyed everything else. 
 Good. 
 DR. SINGH What.. . what are you...? 
 We can share this, Templar. 
 We don't own it. 
 Who does? 
 (eyes glinting) The Jillian St. Thomas Foundation. 
 Don't be a fool. 
 I'm a fool? You thought you could get away with murder. Used curare didn't you? Induces blood-clotting. 
 What do you want? 
 What do I want? I want.. . revenge. Now give me the disk. 
 Here's one from that guy who owns most of Brooklyn. Ten bucks again. 
 I'll alert the media. Guy's richer than god... 
 (reads a check) Hey, Mr. Anderson at the Met gave a thousand this year. Lucy? 
 Oh my goodness gracious... (looks at Delores) Get Mr. Thomas, Delores. 
 What is it? 
 A check for fifty... (gulps) ...million dollars. 
 It's from a "Jillian St. Thomas Foundation," for the benefit of scientific research. 
 Never heard of it. Lemme see.

 Oh, yes.  I remember it well... 
 That's my boy!  Good swingin', kiddo. (warm beat; then a look) Hey -- Michael... where's your brother? 
 He's inside. 
 Is he in his room? 
 Of course he's in his room. (aggravated) All his "friends" are in there. 
 (O.S.) (as WORRIED GIRL) But professor, why are the monsters growing so big? (now as BRITISH 
) It's something in the jungle water. I need to crack the secret code. 
 (as BRITISH 
) Maybe I should talk to the natives. (as dancing NATIVES) Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba -- 
 Andy! 
 (startled) Oh! 
 Andy, this has to stop.  Our house isn't a television station.  There is not a camera in that wall. 
 But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five. 
 (he blows his top) You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience! 
 (he points at the wall) B-but I have them. 
 No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?! 
 (as KIDDIE SHOW 
) And now, boys and girls!  It's time for... TV Fun House! (he makes an 
) Hi, everybody!  Are you ready for a singalong?  I'll say the animal, and you make his sound!  Okay...?  Okay! (he starts to SING) "Oh, the cow goes........." 
 Moo. 
 (he smiles, pleased) "And the dog goes......" 
 
! 
 "And the cat says......" 
 
!! 
 "And the bird says..." 
 
!! 
 "And the lion goes..." 
 
!! 
 "And that's the way it goes!" (he grins) Thank you.  Goodbye! 
 The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman, Ladies and Gentlemen! 
 So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...? 
 (awkward) Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go... 
 You're firing me?? (beat) You don't even pay me! 
 Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records... 
 What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"?? 
 Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material... 
 I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does! 
 Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel." 
 #1 Give us your wallet. 
 #1 Give us your money! 
 #1 What's in the case? 
 #2 Shut up!  Gimme that thing! 
 #1 Goddamn immigrants! 
 #2 This guy's pathetic.  Let's go. 
 So I'm getting my mother-in-law a special Christmas present: A pre- paid funeral!  The mortician asked me if I wanted her buried, embalmed or cremated.  I said, "Make it all three!  I'm not takin' any chances!" (the crowd LAUGHS) Thank you.  Good night! The comic waves and exits.  APPLAUSE.  George politely claps.  A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune. 
 ANGLE - GEORGE 
 Pst.  What's the story with this guy? 
 I think he's Lithuanian.  None of us can understand him. 
 He does a hell of an Elvis. 
 Hey, I really enjoyed your set. 
 So I understand you're from Lithuania? 
 Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that. 
 Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry. (beat) Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk. 
 Mr. Shapiro, it's an honor!! 
 Caspiar, huh?! 
 You see, I want to be the biggest star in the world. 
 People love... comedians. 
 I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent. (he shrugs) I'm a song-and-dance man. 
 You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself? 
 (bright) I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall. 
 Yeah, ha-ha.  That's funny. 
 See, I don't want easy laughs. 
 You're insane. (then sincere) But -- you might also be brilliant. Alright, Andy... let's do it. 
 Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig.  You'll be on the road... get some exposure... 
 (O.S.) Tony Clifton on the phone! 
 Who? 
 (O.S.) He says he's an associate of Andy Kaufman's. 
 Oh. (back to the phone) Sammy, think about it.  I gotta go. (he punches a line) Hello?  George Shapiro here. 
 (V.O.) Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO? 
 (beat) Er, yes.  Speaking. 
 (V.O.) "Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking! 
 Can I help you with something? 
 (V.O.) Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you! 
 (stunned) Who is this? 
 (V.O.) You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear. (beat) Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear. 
 Look... I don't know what your problem is... 
 (V.O.) Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU! 
 Now, while continuing your deep breathing, slowly open your eyes. You should feel rested, relaxed, and alert. 
 Do any thoughts come...? 
 #1 My mind is clear.  I feel great. 
 Good... 
 #2 All the tension is gone from my body. 
 I want to thank you, your Holiness. My heart is radiating with pure energy. 
 You always had a good heart.  But I'm proud of the progress you've made in your discipline. 
 Yes.  TM got me focused.  In fact, my manager got me a TV gig!  It's just some new show with no budget, but I'm still excited. 
 Are you at peace with your family? 
 Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here. 
 Goals are important. 
 I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life... 
 We are all impressed. 
 Okay.  Anyone else --? 
 Oh, wait!  I have a question. (beat; working up his nerve) Is there... is there a secret to being funny? 
 Yes.  Silence. 
 I still can't believe my brother's gonna be on TV...! 
 I hope he doesn't get nervous. 
 What's the difference?  This thing's on in the middle of the night -- no one's even gonna see it. 
 Welcome back to Saturday Night Live! And now, as a special treat on our first show... musical guest ANDY 
!!! 
 What's happening to him? 
 Oh my God, he's doing nothing.  It's dead air...! 
. 
 Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!! 
 The stewardess let me keep my headphones. 
 That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG... (giddy; milking the moment) You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!! 
 Sitcom...? 
 And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie! 
 (confused) I'm -- Fonzie? 
 NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes! 
 (soft) George, I hate sitcoms. 
 HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into -- (he checks his notes) "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!! 
 No. 
 "No"?  "No" to which part?? 
 No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good. 
 Andy... this is every comedian's dream. 
 I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter. 
 (shocked) B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha-- 
 I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material. 
 You have to do it. 
 I refuse. 
 (he explodes) LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!! 
 Okay.  Fine, I'll do it. (beat) But I have a few terms. 
 (relieved) Of course!  That's what negotiations are for. 
 Writing down my terms. 
 Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS! 
 (blas&#1081;) Those are my terms. 
 They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus! (he points at one item) I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?! 
 He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that. 
 This Clifton called me up.  He's a loon!  He HATES you! 
 Nah, he just talks tough.  But I owe him one. 
) Heyyyyyy! 
 Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half the episodes. (beat) Mr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed 90 minutes of meditation prior to filming. (beat) Mr. Kaufman won't rehearse. (beat) Mr. Kaufman gets his own network Special. 
 WHO??? 
 Tony Clifton. 
 #1 Who is he?! 
 (solemn) I don't know. 
 #2 Couldn't Kaufman ask for more money, like everyone else? 
 Andy? 
 (O.S.) Hi George! 
 Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere? 
 (O.S.) Of course. (beat) But only on Monday nights. 
 That's alright.  Where...? 
 (V.O.) And now, Mama Roma's is proud to present International Singing Sensation... a man who has sold more records than Elvis and the Beatles combined... 
 Goddamn, I paid five dollars for this. 
 (V.O.) And now!  A man who needs no introduction... TONY CLIFTON! 
 Heh-heh.  How ya all doin'? 
 Fuck you! 
 (singing) "Volare! Whoa, whoa. Cantare, Whoa whoa whoa whoa." 
) How's that pasta carbonara? 
 Leave me alone. 
 Okay! (he spins around) So, you havin' a good time, sir?! 
 Sure... 
 What's your name? 
 Bob. 
 (he reacts as if this is enormously funny) "Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob. (beat) Bob what? 
 Bob Gorsky. 
 "Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish? 
 (meek) Yes. 
 Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant! 
 (timid) It's my name. 
 SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes! 
 (he giggles stupidly) A -- a tourist. 
 See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about! (enraged) Here!  I'LL give you a little humor! 
 And YOU.  I wanna see you backstage! 
 Alright, I'm here.  What do you want? 
 Are you hungry? 
 I... I-I don't understand this act. 
 (in jolly spirits) It's good old-fashioned entertainment.  Everyone loves a villain. 
 Yeah?  Well tell that to the poor schlub who you humiliated! 
 Hey Andy, good show. 
 Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years. 
 That was a really hot house! 
 So your name's not Gorsky. 
 Don't believe everything you hear. 
 This has to stay in the room... but here's the thing: Andy is Tony.  And Tony is Andy!  They'll deny it up and down, but I swear to God, they're the same person! (with urgency) It's smart business!  You'll get two Andy Kaufmans for the price of one! 
 Andy! 
 (still playing the game) What's up? 
 Andy... THEY SAID YES!  They agreed to it all!  They thought your terms were a shining example of your "irreverent wit" -- and precisely why they want you! (beat) You're getting EVERYTHING! 
 Well thank you very much...! 
 Man, this is bullshit! (he marches up to the PRODUCER) Where's Kaufman?  Why isn't he here?? 
 You'll see him on Friday when we shoot.  Now run the lines with Rodney. 
 I'm taking bets we do the show with the stand-in. 
 No, I hear Andy arrived.  Rumor is he's locked inside his dressing room. 
 MONTAGE - TAXI 
 I'm gonna quit. 
 What?!? 
 Each show is worse than the next. 
 Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week! 
 So?  What do they know? 
 Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty! (he lowers his voice) It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads! 
 I don't care!  Travolta signed a contract, he's a Sweathog for life!... Oh yeah?  Just try to sue us. 
 Sir, they're having a problem down on the Kaufman Special.  They say he's not following the... technical requirements. 
 "Technical"??? 
 It's my show!  Now make it roll! 
 Andy, I hear fabulous things about the Special... (a delicate pause) Eh, I understand we've hit a teeny speedbump? 
 Show me. 
 (happy) It'll be great.  The viewer will think their TV is broken.  They'll get out of their chair, they'll twist the knobs, they'll hit the TV, but they won't be able to fix it! 
 Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel. 
 But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated! 
 Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program. 
 But it's only for thirty seconds! 
 Five. 
 Twenty! 
 Ten. 
 Deal. 
 Mr. Kaufman, do you want your mail? 
 ... Yes, it's Andy Kaufman!... Really! ...I got your fan letter... So you like the show?  Your letter said I was silly.  Did you think I was too silly?... Oh good.  I'm glad. 
 ... so after I finish junior college, I'll go to work for my dad's accounting firm.  Unless, I decide to live with my friend Valerie, but she wants to move to Anaheim, and I don't want to do that. 
 Oh. 
 Excuse me -- ? 
 Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice. (pause) That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together. 
 What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago. 
 (calm) No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling. 
 I don't wanna talk about it! 
 What do you mean? 
 (a bit offput) I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day. 
 (he shrugs dully) I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark. (pause) But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED??? 
 ANGLE - MIMI 
 I think I wanna go home. 
 #2 This is NOT funny. 
 #3 (ominous) "Artsy Fartsy shit"... 
 (worried at this response) No... eh, the Special isn't all like this... just wait... it will be hysterical. 
 Christ!  We're the Number One Network -- can't we afford decent TVs?! 
 No, um... it's part of the snow. 
 Tell Kaufman we will NEVER air this program!! 
 Yeah, yeah, in a sec'. (he lugs the dishes to the kitchen) That was decaf, right? 
 Yeah, I get that all the time. 
 Hey!  Could you clear this table and bring me a piece of poundcake? 
 (infuriated) NO!  I'd rather work here, than at ABC.  There's no lying in a restaurant.  They don't promise you a job as a cashier, then suddenly make you a frycook! 
 Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like -- 
 The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special! 
 (trying to calm him) Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it -- 
 (bitter) Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!" 
 You signed for five years -- (awkward) So four years, seven months. 
 (he looks up) Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony! 
 Thank you.  It's great to be here. We're going to have a very nice time.  We'll sing some songs -- 
 
!! 
 Uh, we'll play with puppets -- 
 LATKA!  LATTTTKAAAA!!! 
 Excuse me one moment. 
 Give me the book. 
 (startled) No!  Andy, don't do it -- 
 They're asking for it. 
 Since you're such a special audience... I'm going to reveal, for the first time ever, the real me. (he goes into a CLIPPED BRITISH 
) I'm actually British.  I was raised in London and educated at Oxford. And though I dabble in clowning, I do find it so boorish.  So... American. (beat) I prefer the fine arts.  Henceforth, tonight,  I'd like to grace you with a reading of the greatest novel ever written! (he holds up the book) "The Great Gatsby", by F. Scott Fitzgerald!! 
. 
!!! 
 Is he ever going to stop? 
 (dour) Sure.  When he reaches "The End." 
 Do Latka. 
 Nobody likes anarchy more than me... but this is science fiction! 
 Let's get some breakfast. 
 What kind of show was this??! (angrily reading off a LIST) There were three-hundred walkouts! The promoter wants a refund! 
 I'm sorry, George... 
 You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry! (turning on Zmuda) And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him! 
 (a guilty sigh) We might have lost our focus... 
 When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude. (beat) If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!! 
 But George, I like to push the boundaries... 
 And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care! 
 How long would they let me sleep? 
 I don't know! (he composes himself and lowers his voice to a hush) Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself? 
 ANGLE - ANDY 
 I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work. 
 (he thinks) Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out. 
 Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice... 
 I dunno about this... (worried) What will my mother think? 
 She'll say, "Now my son is a man." 
 It's so dirty. 
 Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns. 
 Okay. 
 Which one? 
 This is a big day.  It's my friend's first time with a prostitute. 
 (mocking) What're you talking about?  Andy comes here almost every weekend. 
 You're talking about... Andy? 
 Oh, he doesn't always call himself that.  Sometimes he's Tony, and wears a tux. 
 You let me win. 
 (she giggles sexily) What if we did...?! 
 Hey.  If I give you three-hundred dollars, will you come to LA and help me destroy a TV show? 
 Where is he? 
 He just arrived. 
 He's an hour late. 
 Look, I'm told this Clifton guy is a little eccentric.  You're all just gonna have to roll with the punches this week. 
 Taxi!  Laxy!  Just the factsy, Maxie!  Them's all the words that rhyme with taxi!... Right, girls? 
) I added me a musical number, cut out Judd Hirsch, and changed the location to Mardi Gras! 
 And now, the new theme song! (he starts SINGING) "Oh yes, we drive a taxi, And we're havin' fun. Yeah, we work together, And we get the freakin' job done." 
 George, we've lost two days. Filming is on Friday.  We HAVE to let him go! 
 (worried) I'm not sure how Andy's gonna take this... 
 So we'll go downstairs and tell him! 
 But that's Tony down there.  That's not Andy.  Trust me, it's like "Sybil" -- Andy's nowhere on the premises! 
 Well whoever the fuck that is, I'm firing him! 
 (he sighs) Okay.  But we'll have to warn Andy first.  I think he's up in San Francisco, doing a concert. 
 (V.O.) Hi, George!  Good to hear from you! 
 Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there? 
 (V.O.) Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy! 
 I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony. 
 (V.O.) Oh no!  Did he get hurt? 
 No, no, Andy, nothing like that. (nervous beat) But... Tony's not fitting in.  His style of performance is too... burlesque. 
 Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him. 
 (V.O.) Oh dear! (upset) George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break. 
 There'll be other shots. 
 Andy, I have to do it.  He's a terrible actor. 
 (V.O.) I guess I understand.  But Ed -- please... let him down gentle. 
 Yes, Andy, I will. 
 FUCK YOU!  I AIN'T GOIN'!! 
 We had a deal!! 
 I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else -- 
 Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman! 
 I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places. 
 Get off my stage!  You're fired! 
 I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR! 
 Who're YOU?! 
 I'm from the LA Times.  We're doing a little puff piece on Mr. Clifton. (beat) Mr. Kaufman arranged it. 
 Security!  Escort this man off the lot!! 
 Stop!  GETCHER HANDS OFF ME! 
 I don't want those pictures getting out. 
 (to the reporter) This is a closed set.  You'll have to give me the film in that camera. 
 I'll take care of this. 
 Wait -- he's one of THEM! 
 Stop!  HELP!  You wouldn't do this to Wayne Newton -- 
 Hey.  Good hustlin'. 
 That asshole!  That FUCKING 
!! (he SLAMS the door behind him) We had a fuckin' deal, and THAT COCKSUCKER SHAFTED ME!! 
 Um, Ed... you have a phone call -- 
 I'M NOT IN! 
 Well, um... it's Andy Kaufman... 
 Yeah??? 
 (V.O.) You were brilliant. 
 Huh? 
 (V.O.) You were in the moment.  You became a producer losing his mind. (sincerely joyful) It was the best improv I've ever seen. 
 Well -- thank you. 
 (V.O.) Okay.  See you next week. 
 This is great!  It makes Tony REAL - - three-dimensional!  It's very good for his career. 
 "Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?" 
 (he chortles) Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy! 
) Hey, can I please have some more seaweed?! 
 Mr. Shapiro, this is Gene Knight, up at Harrah's Tahoe.  We'd like to book Andy Kaufman for our showroom. 
 Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him. 
 (O.S.) Oh. 
 (startled) Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe?? 
 (O.S.) (being tricky) Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman. 
 Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman. 
 (O.S.) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know! (he LAUGHS merrily) Wink wink!  Nudge nudge! 
 (frustrated) No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY. 
 (O.S.) (LAUGHING harder) I'll take my chances!! 
 Fine, be my guest!  Book him. 
 Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them! (upset) It's physically impossible! 
 (O.S.) Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman -- 
 Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen! 
 (O.S.) Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me! 
 You're not listenin'!  It's a VERY simple concept. 
 Trust me!  You'll never see them on stage at the same time! 
 SHUT UP!!!!!! 
!!! 
 He's never gonna start!  Kaufman thinks this is funny! (beat) We've paid forty bucks for a show that's never gonna start! 
 Thank you!  Thank you!  I wrote this tune for my friend Frank Sinatra. He had a nice little success with it... but forgot to thank me on the album. 
. 
 You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!" 
 But wasn't it funny? 
 "Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure. (softening) Like, that moment, when you both came onstage... 
 Uh-huh!  See, with all these articles, people think they're insiders.  They see Tony Clifton, and they say, "Ah, that's really Andy Kaufman."  But that spoils it. So NOW, Tony denying being me is the truth!  Tony's not me!  But maybe he is!  The audience will never know... (giddy) They'll think they're laughin' at me -- but actually I'll be laughin' at them, because they're wrong and I'm right! 
 So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe. (dry) You... and you. 
 Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head! 
 (he turns serious) But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world? 
 George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do. (thoughtful) 'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them. 
 But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore. 
 George, it never was. (pause) Didn't you know that? 
 Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy! 
 What is this, World War Two...? 
 You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler... 
 No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge! 
 Maybe I'll pick on someone smaller than me...! 
 ... And I vow to continue wrestling until I am BEA TEN, in a three- minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the mat!! 
 (nonplussed) By a woman. 
 Yes!  BY A WOMAN! (emphatic) I'm doing this because I feel that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling.  Even if they train with weights... it requires a certain mental ability -- (a clumsy pause) And, uh -- I just don't feel they have that... 
 Any... volunteers...? 
 I wanna kill that jerk. 
 I'm the winner!  I've got the 
! (he points at his head) Now baby, don't fight nature!  Get back in the kitchen where you belong!!! 
 Here's your complimentary photo with Merv.  Here's your Turtle Wax -- 
 I don't need Turtle Wax. 
 Every guest of Merv gets it.  And here's your dinner-for-two voucher at Red Lobster. 
 Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies! 
 Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else. 
 Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show! (eager to impress) It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd. 
 Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole. 
 It's what I'm good at! 
 Merv Griffin has received 2000 pieces of hate mail.  Andy, Merv Griffin doesn't GET hate mail. 
 That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock! (he hands him a 
) Here, take this. 
 No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back. 
 They're having a laugh... 
 WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody! 
 That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN... (a maniacal grin) They'll catch on! 
 I am the Intergender Wrestling Champion of the World!!! 
 Two, please. 
 Hi... 
 Hi... am I late? 
 No, I'm sure we'll be fine. 
 Popcorn? 
 No thanks. 
 I really want one. (at the counter) One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter. 
 Andy, the theater's that way! 
 Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond." 
 (beat; then she laughs) Fine. 
 Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you. 
 Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY 
 Hi... 
 Hi... am I late? 
 No, I'm sure we'll be fine. 
 Popcorn? 
 No thanks. 
 I really want one. (at the counter) One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter. 
 Andy, the theater's that way! 
 Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond." 
 (beat; then she laughs) Fine. 
 Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you. 
 Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. 
 You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television. 
 Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you. 
 I'm here, ain't I? 
 Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married? 
 (incredulous) Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married? 
 Yes. 
 Why Memphis? 
 (he SPEAKS VERY 
) Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say??? 
 And all this will be for real? 
 (a soft smile) If you want... 
 (screaming) SHUT UP! (more BOOS) SHUT UP!  Show some respect!  I want SILENCE when I speak! 
 Look here, Andy Kaufman!  I'll take you on -- SISSY! 
 Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen! 
 ("outraged") No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes! 
 STOP IT!  This woman's a FAKE! She's nothing but Kaufman's girlfriend! 
 T-that's not true -- 
 It's a set-up!  And I won't allow our great sport to be degraded by a fix!! 
 Andy... who is that...? 
 I'm Jerry Lawler, the KING of Memphis wrestling!! (this gets HUGE 
) So if Kaufman wants to tangle, I've brought a real wrestler!  She's trained and she's READY!!  Kaufman, do you think you can handle... FOXY 
???!!! 
 Are you scared??? 
 Alright, you won.  GET OFF HER! 
 Jerry, help her!  Get in there!  Do something! 
 W-what are you DOING?  I don't fight men! 
 YEAH?!  Well I got news for you, Andy Kaufman!  Wrestling is a serious sport to me!  I don't like anyone makin' fun of it, and I hate anyone insultin' the South!  So we can settle this two ways: We can go to court... or you can get in the ring with a man, and wrestle for REAL! 
 He -- can't get away with this. (to Lawler) YOU!  You think I'm CHICKEN?! 
) You wanna "wraaastle" me?!  You wanna "WRAAASTLE" me???  Okay, Lawler -- let's rumble!  Yeah, I've only wrestled women, but they were bigger than you!  In fact, they're probably smarter than you, 'cause you're from "Maaamphis, Taaanassee!" (back to his regular voice, he points at his head) I'm from Hollywood.  I have the brains.  That's how I win.  And Mr. Lawler, I'm gonna make you cry "Mama!" 
 Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble?? 
 (he jokingly impersonates a drunk) I can shtop whenever I want... 
 Then stop treating me like a fucking prop. 
 (he drops the act) I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...! 
 I'm warning you, Kaufman:  One morning you're gonna wake up... and your head's gonna be shaved. 
 Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do (he SINGS Mighty Mouse) "Here I come to save the day!"? (long beat) Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality! 
 (ingenuous) What, you don't think I can beat him? 
 He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you. (very disapproving) First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed! (dry) And I did the bookings. 
 You said -- live? 
 I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor! 
 Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for! (playing "stoned") "Maui?  "Wowie!" 
 (losing his temper) You're not listening to me -- 
 Don't worry!  The kids will love it -- 
 (he BLOWS up) But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them! (YELLING) I was promised creative control! 
 What a prick! 
 It's on!  JANICE, IT'S ON! 
 In this next sketch, two married couples are out to dinner.  Now... everybody has secretly brought along a joint -- (crowd WHOOPS, he grins) So, when each person leaves the table, they sneak into the restroom to get a little high... 
 I saw Michael! 
 Where? 
 (points to the set) There! 
 Afterwards, I'll take you backstage. You can meet my brother. 
 "Gee, restaurants are amazing, aren't they?  All these strangers sitting around... stuffing dead animals in their faces!  It's just incredible!" 
 "If you say so." 
 "Excuse me, I'll be right back." 
 Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do. 
 He said he's coming back! 
 "Gee, that bathroom is so colorf--" 
 You okay, honey?  Something wrong, Carl? 
 I can't, um... 
 Shit...!  What's he doing?? 
 It's okay.  Stay with it. 
 (whispering to Andy) Just read the cue cards! 
 (he shakes his head) I can't play stoned.  I feel really stupid. 
 You feel stupid?  What about us?! 
 You didn't have to do that! 
 Hey!  CUT IT OUT! 
 You JERK! 
 Go to commercial, man! (he turns to Andy) Get off the stage! 
 I said I didn't want to do the sketch. 
 (he JABS him) GET OFF! 
 DON'T TOUCH ME! 
 Go to three!  Eh, go to four! 
 I shoulda made him play outdoors. 
 We've gone to commercial!  I said, WE'VE GONE TO COMMERCIAL!! 
 Oh my God --! 
 Why didn't someone tell us??? 
 Excuse me!... I have an announcement to make!  You've all just participated in a "happening."  To make it real, some of you knew, and some of you didn't. 
 (very quiet) Right... 
 Okay, great!  So let's reset! 
 Andy...! 
 Why is Andy doing this?  Why?... Why? 
 And... um... (choking up) I can't do this. (beat) I-I can't say it. (upset) It's a lie!  A cover-up! 
 Cue the commercial! 
 I'm gonna STRANGLE George Shapiro! 
 What's in Memphis? 
 Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga. 
 And now!  The MAIN EVENT of the evening!  The match you've been waiting for: The King Jerry Lawler, versus Hollywood Andy Kaufman! 
 (O.S.) C'MON, KAUFMAN!  Christ, you're ON! 
 Before we begin this event, I just wanna say a few things to you foul people. (beat) This city is filthy!  You Southerners live like pigs!  So I'm going to teach you some lessons in hygiene... bring you out of your squalor. 
!!! 
 Why is he saying these things?! 
 They're gonna lynch him! 
 (he shakes his head) Nah.  He's just engaging a passive audience. 
 People, this is a bar of soap.  Does it look familiar to you?  If you wet it, it'll clean your hands. 
 Kaufman, we've had enough!!  Let's you and me do what we came here for 
 --! 
 (V.O.) And Kaufman's left the ring! Lawler's waiting for him to return. 
 (to Zmuda) Is this a strategy? 
 (V.O.) And Kaufman's left the ring again! He doesn't seem interested in actually making contact with his opponent. 
 Andy, please.  Let's go home! 
 Don't worry, Mom.  I'll make you proud...! 
 Hey!  Did you come down here to wrestle, or to act like an ass? 
 (V.O.) It's a side suplex!! 
 (frantically gesturing) NO!  NO! 
 
!!!!! 
 Why isn't he MOVING?? 
 (V.O.) Lawler has committed a PILEDRIVER, which is an AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFICATION!  Match goes to Kaufman by disqualification, after two minutes, twelve seconds! Andy is splayed unconscious. 
 
!!! (frantic) Somebody get a DOCTOR! 
 (yelling) WE NEED A STRETCHER!! 
 Andy!!  Are you okay?!? 
 I'm fine, Mom, you can calm down. 
 B-but... we saw... your neck... 
 Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. (beat) It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in. 
 Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!

 Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking! 
 But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest! 
 Andy, I love you!  I love you, whatever you do...! 
 Geez, I'm sorry.  Maybe I shouldn't have put you through all that... (quiet) Well, from now on, you'll always know the rule of thumb: Anything that happens to me... IS NOT REAL. 
 I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman. 
 Are you sure? 
 Positive. 
 But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough... 
 It's probably just a strained muscle. 
 (intent) Doctor, I think I need a neck brace. 
 If it makes you happy... 
 (reading aloud) "... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"... 
 It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me. 
 It's working for Elvis. 
 (sarcastic) Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback. (he sees an article and winces) God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..." 
 Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity! 
 George, let's not drop the ball on this.  I've made some kind of cosmic career move. 
 Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. (he takes a careful beat) I... I wanted to talk to you about booking Andy on "Saturday Night Live." 
 George -- I don't know if Andy works for our show anymore.  That wrestling stuff... is such a turnoff. 
 We agree completely. (tactfully begging) Andy has to reconnect with his core audience.  So I got him on Letterman tonight.  He's gonna apologize to Jerry Lawler, then repent for all his bad guy shenanigans. 
 That's smart. 
 He's very sincere. (quietly emphatic) And he needs your show... 
 Okay.  It'd be good to have the old Andy back. 
 I apologize for all the wrestling I've ever done.  I'm sorry for all the abuse I've ever given... (soft) I was just playing bad guy wrestler. That's not me... it's just a role. But Jerry took it personally. 
 You said some pretty inflammatory things. 
 He thinks everything's a joke -- but it's not. (to Andy) Did you laugh when you were layin' in the hospital?? 
 T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me -- 
 You're a wimp. 
 (upset) My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --! 
 Then your father's a wimp. 
 (losing it) And you're just poor white trash! 
! 
! (he POUNDS the desk) FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU!  I WILL GET YOU FOR THIS!!!

 Jesus Christ. 
 Hi.  Um, we were supposed to have Andy Kaufman on our show this week - - but now our producers aren't sure if it's such a good idea. (beat) Some of us at Saturday Night Live think Kaufman's a comic genius.  But others disagree... they say he's just not funny anymore. (beat) So we're putting the decision up to you.  Please call up and vote.  To keep Andy, call 1-900-244-7618.  To DUMP him, call... 
 This is bad... I only got 28 percent!  I'm like McGovern in '72... 
 And this wasn't "Merv."  This was the hippest audience on television. (grim) They've turned on you. 
 (guilty) We were just trying to push the envelope -- 
 You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!! (beat) It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution -- (pained) I don't want you two to ever work together again. 
 I'm sorry.  We thought it was funny... 
 Jer', it's not your fault.  You were terrific. (sad) But maybe George is right... 
 That's fine.  But I wouldn't have traded it for anything... (poignant) Because for one brief, shining moment... the world thought that wrestling was real. Andy gulps emotionally. 
 We'll stay in touch.  Next time I'm in Memphis, I'll stop by the house, and Noreen can make me her double chocolate cake. 
 Alright, buddy... (choked up) Stay good. 
 Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount... 
 Andy!  You don't get it! (somber) They don't want you back. 
 Open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes... 
 Excuse me, Andy... 
 Yes, your Holiness? 
 This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat. 
 (surprised) Why??  I... I attend every year. 
 Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically. 
 "Philosophically"? 
 (he sighs) The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual. (beat) It seems you have no respect for anything. 
 Of course I do... 
 Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!! 
 It is apparently not working. 
 So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is 
!! 
 (pained) Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here. 
 Go away. 
 (O.S.) It's me. 
 Oh, it's open. 
 I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate. 
 (mournful) I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person. 
 Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated. 
 You don't know the real me. 
 Andy... there is no real you. 
 You're probably right. 
 Do you wanna move in together? 
 Hey!  Our first phone call! (he scrambles for the phone) Hello? 
 (V.O.) Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news. (long beat) Taxi's been canceled. 
 Um... no.  Uh, I'm sorta busy right now.  Thanks.  We'll get together next week. 
 And now we have a treat for you late- night diehards.  The star of Taxi -- here in person, Andy Kaufman! 
 Actually, Budd, you're wrong.  I found out today that Taxi's been canceled. 
 I made six bucks.  That's good money. 
 This is a comedy club -- not a medical sideshow. (trying to be kind) If you wanna perform here, take a shower, get some sleep, and pull yourself together.  Come back and do the material that people love: Do the Mighty Mouse, the Foreign guy! Andy, you gotta snap out of this funk!  If you can -- I'll give you the headline spot tomorrow. 
 Hey, what's going on here? 
 George, you won't believe it... I got Andy to do all the old material! (grinning) And he's killin' them! 
 "Take my wife, please take her." 
 "Her cooking is so bad, is terrible." 
 Sir, do you have a problem? 
 I, I was asked to do this material - - 
 (defensive) Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers -- 
 (to himself) Why...?  Andy, why...? 
 I used to think you were original. 
 I was very original! 
 Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt. (he gleams cruelly) In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine. (back to Andy) Isn't that true??? 
 The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want... 
 (sadly) Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you. 
 
 I'll come up with something. 
 Andy!!... Where are you?  I've been worried sick... NOW??... Where do you want to meet?... Okay, I'll call them... 
 Look at that Grand Slam!  Two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes -- $2.99!  How do they do it? 
 They get you on the coffee. 
 (irritable) Excuse me -- but could Andy tell us why we're here??? 
 I have cancer. 
 Hey, that's good!  We can make that play. (spitballing) And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die... 
 FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this. 
 Andy, are you serious? 
 (grinning) Serious like a heart attack!  Hey, maybe I can push you around in some goofy wheelchair! 
 No, it's true.  I have lung cancer. 
 That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke. 
 (emphatic) I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma. 
 Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it? 
 They don't know... they've gotta run more tests. 
 (starting to cry) Have you told your family? 
 No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times. 
 Andy... you look me in the eye, and tell me this is true. 
 George -- it's true. 
 If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you. 
 What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it! 
 Exactly.  That's the sort of thing you guys would work out to fuck me up. 
 How can you be so casual??! 
 (he shrugs) Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks. 
 You're NOT DYING! 
 Okay.  You're probably right. 
 God, you're so detached!! 
 (on phone) Dad...? 
 The cancer started in Andy's left arm and spread to his lungs.  We've initiated an aggressive radiation program... see if we can eradicate the affected cells. (his BEEPER goes off) Excuse me.  I'll be right back. 
 What a crock. 
 (angered) How dare you make light of this! 
 Dad, I cried when he broke his neck. He's not gettin' me again -- 
 (impassioned) Jesus!  He's got lung cancer! 
 See, that's exactly it!  He picked lung cancer, because he doesn't smoke.  That makes it weird!  If he'd picked leukemia, it'd be totally believable, and we'd all be going, "Poor Andy, he's really sick."  So he chose lung cancer, because he WANTS us to be scratching our heads, saying, "Is this real?" 
 (trying to convince herself) Of course it's real.  We're in a hospital... 
 Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai!  It's a showbiz hospital!  Andy's studio friends probably run this place! 
 He plans these things out.  He takes over, hires actors... (beat) Personally, I didn't think that "doctor" was very convincing. 
 Did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes? 
 (excited) Yeah!  He didn't have doctor shoes! 
 We all know he's talked about faking his own death... 
 Sure -- but what if he isn't? (sad; poignant) My son could be dying... and we're actin' like we're on Candid Camera. 
 I see them... I see the white cells... 
 What was that all about? 
 It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease. 
 He's an actor.  I remember him in "The In-Laws." 
 Uh, yes... that's true.  But he's also ordained in holistic medicine. 
 You must take a little pleasure in it. 
 Of course! (beat) But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy. 
 Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy. 
 (thrown) Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead. 
 So how can I help you...? 
 I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. (bright-eyed) The best show anybody's ever seen! 
 Do you wanna tour the clubs? 
 No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP! (beat) Carnegie Hall...! 
 #1 I'm working on a great cover story: I've got a guy in the lab at Cedars. He says Andy Kaufman is dying of lung cancer. 
 What bullshit!  No.  No more Kaufman stories!  He's burned us too many times! 
 #2 Yeah, he's definitely not dying. He's playing Carnegie Hall next month! 
 #1 Jesus.  Only Kaufman would use cancer as a publicity stunt. 
 This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this! (giddy; thinking) Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive? 
 I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80. 
 Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show. (excited) I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down! 
 And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!" 
 No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive! 
 That's great... but this show's gonna cost a fortune.  Even if it sells out, you'll still lose eighty grand. 
 I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver. 
 So who's gonna pay for it? 
 Tony Clifton. 
 (beat) You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money. 
 Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it! 
 Okay, Andy.  Will do. 
 Abbu daba, abi abbu daba!  Abbu daba, abu dabu do! (to the crowd) Abbu dabbu da ba do...! 
 ABBU DABBU DA BA DO!! 
 A ba du ba ti la ma na go! 
 A BA DU BA TI... LA... MA NA GO... 
 (grinning) Abbu da ba du ba ti lama na gobo abi tabu la! 
 ABBU DA BA DU... 
 Ladies and Gentlemen!  I'm pleased to announce that we have with us the one surviving cowgirl from that 1931 film, Eleanor "Cody" Gould!! 
 (squinting into the lights) Andy... this is so overwhelming... 
 Well, it's gettin' even better! 'Cause we found one of the original hobby horses!  Do you -- do you think you could treat us to a few steps from "Jingle Jangle Jingle"? 
 Is there a doctor in the house??! 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, she's alive! 
 (O.S.) 
 HALLELUJAH!  HALLELUJAH! 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir!!! 
 Single file!  Don't rush!  There's enough cookies for everyone!! 
 I don't want this to ever end... 
 Now we'll place a blue crystal. Very high vibrations.  It's wonderful for it's healing powers. 
 (spellbound) Okay.  Let's try two of those... and one of the pink ones. 
 Your friend is doing four crystal sessions a day, but it's just not helping. 
 I know... (beat) The cancer's terminal. 
 Yes.  That wasn't made particularly clear to us when he checked in... 
 (irked) Look, personally, I think rubbing rocks on people is a load of horseshit.  But if it makes Andy happy, that's all that matters. 
 I'm sorry to sound crass -- but we don't want to be "that health resort in New Mexico where Andy Kaufman died." (beat) I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 
 It's okay, Bob.  It wasn't really working. (a gentle smile) We'll find something better. 
 What is this stuff? 
 It's all macrobiotic.  Millet, burdock root, kelp... Andy says it'll purify him. 
 (O.S.) What is that crap?  Looks like somethin' my dog would puke up!! 
 How 'bout me and you dolls go get some REAL food:  French fries and a Porterhouse steak! 
 (not sure what to say) ...Andy...? 
 I ain't Andy!  I'm Tony!  Andy's sick -- pick, chick, kick, lick! The doctor says he's a goner. (rousing himself) But Tony's built like a mule!  Andy asked me to be his pallbearer!  I'll do it for him!  I'm getting stronger and stronger!  Here, watch this! 
 Stop it!  C'mon, put that down. 
 Yeah, you're right.  We better get movin'.  We don't wanna miss Happy Hour at Kelbos -- all the Mai Tai's you can drink for $4.99. 
 Dammit... 
 I can't move my arm. 
 (awkwardly) You've got good days and bad days. 
 My hair is coming out. 
 (whispers) Yeah... 
 I've got an idea for a new TV show for me to star in.  It's called "Uncle Andy's Fun House" -- it'll be a Saturday morning thing where I can goof off with the kids.  You know, puppets, magic tricks... 
 (long pause) I think we can sell that. 
 Hey... thanks for always backin' me. 
 Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work? 
 Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day. (beat) And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer. 
 (startled) Really? 
 Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out! 
 The Philippines?  I dunno... Andy... he sounds like one of your characters. 
 No... this guy's special. (very sincere) He performs miracles. 
. 
 CLOSEUP - ANDY 
. 
 It's a perfect Kaufman audience. 
 Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry. 
 Why are people leaving?  The curtain's gonna open.  Andy's gonna come out... I know it! 
 Sure, the body was just made of wax...! (a very long beat) Wasn't it......? 
 #2 Oh my GOD. (stupefied) That's the freakiest thing I've ever seen!!  Look! 
 #1 Man, we were right!  He's not dead! 
 #2 He's just been lyin' low for a year! WE GOTTA GO! 
 (V.O.) Ladies and Gentlemen!  Please put your hands together for... Tony Clifton! 
 How ya doin'? 
 Andy!

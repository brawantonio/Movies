 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and the fear I'll forget... 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) I killed innocent men. I betrayed sacred oaths. I reaped profit from horror. The names are dead or too guilty to tell. The events so brutal they beg to be re-told... 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Junior Stemmons. A partner I never asked for. The scowl meant to hide a shit-scared kid who'd been teaching evidence classes three months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD lifer who never got past Sergeant. 
 We should make our move now. 
 I don't wanna be here when Noonan and the Feds show up. 
 We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too- 
 -you're under arrest. 
 -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest- 
 Ladies and Gentleman...due to circumstances beyond our control, Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this- 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Unaware the LAPD was walking away with his two big witnesses. 
 C'MON-JESUS-HE'S RIGHT THERE! 
 If they got shrimp. 
 To know why the fuck I'm here- 
 -mind your tone, Shitbird... 
 Shitbird went out with Vaudeville. You get your badge in a cereal box? 
 (grade-school mind) City of Angels. 
 What? 
 We get to spend time alone now. 
 Want some perfume? 
 ME (CONT'D) What were you gonna tell Welles Noonan? (watch as he flinches) He has a subpoena with your name on it, Sanderline. Why would someone like you need to talk to the U.S. Attorney? 
 ME (CONT'D) You're a legbreaker for the Mob. I know the Men that pay you for that will murder you if they hear you're about to talk to the U.S.- 
 -but they don't know... 
 Bet you they ran outta shrimp. 
 (O.S.) The Spook with you? 
 (O.S.) Me and Sam G. 
 (O.S.) We're out at the place in Palm Springs. You should come out for the weekend. 
 -yer gonna have to make a minute for him. Now. See, we think the Spade might testify that Sam owns him and how we was grooming him for a title shot he was gonna tank. A fight everybody woulda' got flush off of, including the Spade.                        * (beat, quieter) Have him look out the window Klein. 
 What'm I- 
 ME (CONT'D) Remember where you live. 
! 
 Turn it off. 
 `US Attorney Noonan is accusing the Los Angeles Police Department in general, and Lt. David Klein in particular, of murder at worst, gross incompetence at best...' 
 He did spend a month in Camarillo Mental Hospital last year- 
 Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted. So Noonan's Boxing Probe is dead. He's got nothing- 
 -but time, a mandate and new targets...I need to speak to the Lieutenant alone. 
 BRADLEY (CONT'D) Describe to me your duty, as you understood it, regarding Sanderline Johnson and Reuben Ruiz. 
 -and why did I choose you for this? 
 -because your a thug with a law degree. Because I thought by now you'd be so indebted to this Department for not indicting and/or                   * imprisoning you, that diligent, honest discharge of duty would be assured. (beat) And I made a horrible misjudgment.                    * 
 Bob's happy because he wants to be State Attorney General and his most likely opponent will be Welles Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton Diskant, who's leading their City Council race, is endorsed by Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing the larger play. (with calculated emphasis) Noonan's new target will likely be the LAPD itself. 
 Because that's where I would aim: a subpoenaed Federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two LAPD detectives? (beat) This screams Police Corruption.                      * This offers Noonan the possibility of payback in the form of national headlines. 
 My friends would be more interested in this. (beat, flipping file open) Coroner's preliminary: white paint chips found embedded in Sanderline Johnson's scalp. A matching dent on the white window sill. I checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time Johnson flew out of it. (beat, proclamation:) It shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the Chicago mob would take precedence over the LAPD. 
 The appearance of disciplinary measures taken against you are mandated post-Sanderline Johnson,                    * so your suspension will be recorded but sealed...and kept quiet for now-                 * 
 -we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal. 
 Just on paper. (closes the file) Since I misjudged the Cop I thought you were, I'm going to leverage the Cop that you are. 
 BRADLEY (CONT'D) Morton Diskant is to be removed from the City Council race. The means and methods implemented to that end I will entrust to you. 
 -or spend the next month in lock-up                    * before being arraigned on charges                      * of gross misconduct and dereliction                    * of duty. The preamble before you                       * face life in prison for murder.                        * 
 BRADLEY (CONT'D) Diskant works Saturdays. Late. 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Black Buick...five Cars back...feels like a tail... 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...or maybe I just need sleep. 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Press camped out post-Sanderline, looking for quotes to hang me with.                     * 
 (glances from paper to me) I already got the Times inside. 
 How much is true? 
 Zero. 
 Poor you. 
 ME (CONT'D) Pretty please. 
 ME (CONT'D) How's work?                                             * 
 It's work. 
 More work. 
 (turns back at me) You look like Death taking a shit. 
 He's still got that MGM-face. 
 You're still the only guy who ever traded movie-potential for Police work. 
 Because in the movies they make you pull your punches. 
 No. We're going to the Cocoanut- 
 'Favor' mean `free?' 
 Gimme the phone so I can find another Date- 
 -you're the only Man I know who doesn't call Women. 
 What are we doing? 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Junior brought along because he begged. Already hip to how many ways you can make money with a badge. 
 You got a birthday coming up. 
 On the 16th, right? How old? 
 Just notes...about work- 
 Mostly compare and contrast stuff. Street work versus textbook- 
 So you think Noonan will come after you for the Sanderline thing? He seems like a real hard charger. 
 What? 
 Holy Jesus. Is this true? 
 ME (CONT'D) Here we go. 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) God help me if he ever hits me like that. 
 He should suck his dick. Y'know? Put the icing on it. 
 What? 
 Tell me that wouldn't sell it...plus he's a Communist. 
 Off me! 
 I'll fight you rotten- 
 ME (CONT'D) Take the Quiff home. 
 My name's Franklin- 
 ME (CONT'D) I need a nod from you Morton, let's me know you get it- 
 -don't say my name... 
 He gets it. 
 (not looking at us) You eventually lose the ability to reconcile the things you've done to people. That's Hell. 
 (pocketing the money) Y'know Hughes has a job you're tailor-made for. I already gave him your- 
 Stop pretending you're not a pig for all this, Klein. 
 -tossing more Bantamweights out                       * windows? 
 (laughs small, then:) Not even the people who don't know you believe that. If somebody from the DA's office decides to dig, you could fry Boy-o. Be nice to be in with a billionaire who's got a fleet of planes, fly you outta the country on a moment's notice. (beat) C'mon -- it's a cake legal gig. He                    * just wants you to burn some actress that stopped fucking him. 
 PETE (CONT'D) Tomorrow. Hughes Aircraft, 7pm                        * It'll be worth it. 
 ME (CONT'D) Klein- 
 (O.S.) -you know who Hector Magdalena is? 
 (O.S.) He's missing. His home was broken into at some point within the last hour. 
 (O.C.) The only thing taken was him. Wilshire Station is on-scene. Get over there right now. 
 Call it penance. 
 -that makes one of us. 1284 South                         * Tremaine. (MORE) 
 Why are you here? 
 -fuck off. This is handled. And pull your idiot partner out of there- 
 -Magdalena was my Snitch, so it's my scene. 
 (dragged out of him) Guard dogs are dead. Magdalena's missing. 
 I could give a shit. I just want to this case to get a quick burial. 
 Some old broad heard an `argument' and buzzed Wilshire Station.                * 
 The wife and daughter were in Santa Barbara. Just got back. 
                           * The Wife said she got into a fight          * with her Parents, left ASAP.                * 
 What do you think they were                 * fighting about? Santa Barbara Wasps         * don't fancy dope-pushing Wetbacks. 
 (sneering hatred) Tommy. Make him your #1 suspect. 
 He's got a mean streak. And he and          * Hector had been at each others throats for months. Have Tommy              * picked up. He likes to loaf at              * those nigger jazz joints in Watts.          * 
 Get a conviction. Grab Tommy and pin this thing fast or you'll have a whole division of disgraced cops at your front door. 
 You queered the Fed's   Fight Probe by killing that boxer   and they already had a hard-on   for the LAPD-                   * Bradley sent you down   here as damaged goods...think   about it. Everybody sees what's   coming. (beat, closer) Now close this quick. 
 (mid-sentence) -shifty...colored...y'know Negros are planning an invasion! After our white women and our water supply- 
 -where was this Peeper you saw? 
 Bushes. Spyin' on Lucille. Seen him                   * there before! He's a black saboteur                   * looking for fertile white wombs. Wanna breed a mulatto master race-                    * 
 ME (CONT'D) Besides bat-shit insanity, is there anything else about her that rings true? 
 Heard an argument, loud, maybe a minute or two, then silence. 
 She saw someone in the bushes earlier. She's reported that kind of thing a dozen other times. She's also reported flying saucers, so... 
 No one touch a thing `til I say. 
 All I've been doing- 
 ME (CONT'D) The Department gave Magdalena a                      * monopoly on the LA dope trade decades ago- 
 -what Department? 
 -Black and Mexican- 
                            * Fine.                                                * 
 Except for the Son's: Tommy.                         * 
. 
 ME (CONT'D) The old lady hear dogs barking?                       * Gunshots? 
 No, I asked. Just the yelling. 
 How do you know that? 
 You make a family member for it? Tommy? 
 Do you want to issue an APB? 
 (O.S.) Update. 
 Family? 
 Describe their state. 
 Alright, kick everyone out. Including all police personnel. 
 Don't question me. Is your partner on hand? 
 Have him bag and seal everything and bring it to Wilshire Station. Find Tommy Magdalena post-haste and take him into custody. No APB's, nothing to alert Noonan and the FBI to this situation. 
 -no more information over an open                     * line. I'll be at the Bethune event later on today. Find me there. 
 Entirely. Where are you going? 
 (V.O.) Big yawns. Half haze from no sleep. Buzz dispatch. A message from Pete. `Reminder: Hughes aircraft, 7 PM.                      * 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Noonan tail confirmed: Fed faces                       * glow like Martians this far down Crenshaw.

 (beat) Tommy Mag wanted to make sure I understood something he was saying. 
 Left an hour ago. Emptied my safe. 
 To what? You looking for him? 
 Too white to appreciate good grass.                   * 
 Muthafucker -- there is a God. If only I'd known this an hour ago. 
 I don't let him, he just does. Nails on a chalkboard too. He rushed the stage last week when we had Charlie Mingus drop in for a set. Mingus looked at this half-Mex                   * greaser kid trying to play `Round                     * Midnight,' said that fool couldn't                    * find them keys with a flashlight.' 
 Hallelujah. 
 Around four. Him and these Pachucos         * poppin' switchblades like punks. (mops his brow of blood) The only thing that was keepin' him         * `untouched' was Hector...                   * (beat, hopeful-prayer) Is he really dead?                          * 
 (a toke, a thought) I don't feature Tommy for it.               * 
 Yeah, but he ain't got the salt             * to truly take a Man's life.                 * Especially not Hector's...he was            * scared of him.                              * 
                       * `Cuz Hector been whippin' Tommy's           * ass from the time he could talk.            *

                                 * Hector had turned her out. Using                      * her the way the Romans used to use                    * their daughters when they did                         * business: Some pussy to sweeten the                   * pot.

 Drugs. Especially here in South Central. Hector ran it uncontested. Lotta cats gonna rush in now, try to plant a flag.                                      * 
 Tommy couldn't hold his pecker without Hector's help and he knows                    * that. He's gonna bury himself like                    * a tick. Good luck turning him up,                     * he took six or seven grand out the                    * safe tonight.

 #1 Councilman Bethune, was Mr. Diskant dropping out the only way you could have won this race? 
 Not at all. My message of civic advancement manifested in that beautiful blue baseball team was starting to hit home. 
 #3 Anything you'd like to say to future constituents? 
 I like my Dodger Dogs with mustard and relish! 
                              * These functions aren't normally               * open to Jews.                                 *

 I wouldn't have expected so public a showing after Sanderline Johnson. 
 I'm sure he did. And where is your young partner this day? 
 Might the job involve the LAPD's most important missing Wetback, Hector Magdalena? 
 I've known Stemmons since the academy. He was a top pupil. A                * peculiar little pain in the ass, but very good with details. 
 I'm puzzled as to why the Bradley would assign you to the Magdalena                     * case when you're neither Homicide nor Robbery... 
 He does know how to delegate doesn't he...and also I'm sure that poor Negro's nosedive has put you squarely in his debt. 
 Keep me abreast will you? Chief Parker is understandably nervous. Situations like these tend to yield grief...and we've the FBI poking                      * around our garden patch.                              * 
 ME (CONT'D) Tommy Magdalena has gone to ground and he's got a war chest to keep him there. The only way we take him quickly is to issue a citywide APB- 
 -no. We can't risk that. Do you             * make him for the murderer? 
 Do you suspect either of the women?         * 
 Verify that. Where is your partner? 
 Keep him on that. He had excellent ratings as an evidence teacher and          * I trust him more than you. (beat) Find Tommy Magdalena. Focus everything on that effort & I want him apprehended Klein, not killed. 
 And most likely dead. Find the Son.         * Stakeout the residence. Put tails on both the mother and daughter -- I want this investigation working quietly, and around the clock. 
                                    * If he's alive, bring him to me. If he's dead, have him John Doe'd at                    * the morgue until Noonan can be                       * drawn off and this FBI situation                     * sorted out.                                          * 
 -don't worry about Dan Wilhite. You deal directly with me. Now go out the back. I don't want the press recognizing you. 
 (searches my empty hands) You got a cigarette? 
 WOMAN (CONT'D) If you snap a picture of me, I get to set you on fire. Fair? 
 Good thing you're not a cop. 
 Your power of observation leaves lots to be desired. 
 Don't thank me: these things are bad for you. 
 You believe anything you read? 
 No. 
 Everything worthwhile. 
 (schoolboy proud) That this was a random drug seizure. I'm not using names and I'm number coding everything. A load of interesting stuff too. (points to each stack) I got unregistered fire-arms, more dope than I've ever seen, and some mail from business associates that seems hinky. We should follow up-           * (grabs an envelope)                     * -here, this one, `Hurwitz Holdings'         * Hector had some real estate dealings- 
 (like I'm speaking Greek)               * How do you solve a case when the evidence is in bags? 
 (like he's caught) I'm making notes separate from- (gear change off my glare) -I thought we were investigating Magdalena's disappearance- 
 ...No. 
 ME (CONT'D)                                  * Now we need surveillance set up on the house and revolving tails on both Madge and Lucille Magdalena. Their alibi is they were in Santa Barbara when Hector vanished. Find out if that's real. The tails and the stakeout start tonight. (beat) Can you manage this? 
 Sure, Lieutenant.                                       * 
 Gregory Milteer. Attorney-at-Law. A pleasure Lt. Klein. 
 Indeed. (motions to sit) Please. 
 MILTEER (CONT'D) Thanks for your time on a Sunday. 
 Unavailable. Unfortunately. But I've been given full authority to- 
 I don't find that the least bit humorous Lt. Klein. 
 An `Actress' named Glenda Bledsoe signed a Service Contract that she's now willfully violating by acting in a Z-grade horror picture presently `shooting' in Griffith Park. Despite entreaties for her to cease participation in this absurdity, she continues to revel in her outlaw status with us. Thus we would like her destroyed. 
 Mr. Bondurant says you're one of the smarter people he knows- 
 Exactly. The morality clause in particular as the damage to her reputation would be most devastating: Nymphomaniac, Criminal, Communist...anything along these lines. Once you visit the set of her `Attack of the Atomic Vampires,' you'll see the void that is her character. We haven't a photograph handy, but she's playing the lead female role.         * 
 $10,000 should buy more than help. 
 Agreed. Start tonight. Someone's                      * been stealing groceries from our talent domiciles. There's no proof that it's her, but it's her. Peter will provide you addresses. 
 We look forward to your updates. 
 This is the big Armada landing, so I need everybody's energy up, up up! Where's my Alien Commander? 
 RIGHT HERE GOD DAMN IT. 
 ME (CONT'D) Cecil B. Demoted. 
 Where Klein goes tsuris follows. This is what I hate about being down, lip from the likes of you. 
 (gives it right back) Which one of us are you talking about Klein? Word is the Federal Bureau is all hot and bothered with you Gonif. Hey, I hear J. Edgar schtups his personal assistant and makes him wear ladies hose. 
 That this Welles Noonan character has developed quite a crush. That you might want to consider relocating to Dogdick, Delaware. 
 But the bullseye on your back's never been quite so big...if you need a new line of work, I got this faygele leading man needs replacing- 
 His agent told me he could play straight. 
                                * You interested?                                       * 
 -not a chance. I'm still trying to play hide the submarine. 
 Ten years ago I could call for that                   * little Pisher's head on a stick. (looks around) And now... 
 Glenda. 
 Low-budget strategy: I send Glenda and Rock to any event where there's cameras -- Glenda gets guest-a'- honor treatment everywhere with that shape a' her's... 
 Coffee's in the kitchen. Let's go over this quick because I'm beat. 
 We're set on a place where we can stash you and Rock. It's in Topanga Canyon, two weeks- 
 (petulant) -two weeks? My body'll fall apart- 
 -think of it as 14 days of push-ups- (to the Director) Are you sure about this Sid? Seems shaky. Was this Mickey's idea? 
 And I think it's brilliant! Inspired! The two leads of Mickey Cohen's magnum opus get kidnapped! The press'll eat it up! They'll write about `Gangster Mickey,' the glory days. Couple a' headlines like that and interest in Atomic Vampires will go through the roof! (to Glenda) Who's gonna grab you? 
 A charmer I knew in another life...George Ainge. 
 Is he okay with making it look real- 
 -he can't hit me in the face!                         * That's a deal-breaker! 
 He'll be thrilled to knock me around. Plus he's holding something of mine, so we can kill two birds. He'll grab us Tuesday in front of the Pacific Dining Car.                               * 
 What about Hughes? 
 What about him? That angle can only help us. 
 I'm dying to know...was he the Spruce Goose between the sheets? 
 (O.C.) Hung like a newborn and he called my tits `propellers.' 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) No sense of time. Exhaustion steals it. A full hour earlier than I told                     * Junior to meet me. I need sleep.                        * 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)                            * This routine had been done before. That old broad babbling about a Peeper. The only other link to Hector Magdalena's disappearance.                       * 
- 
 That's for Sanderline Johnson. 
 -what were you firing at? 
 (to one of the goons) -write that name down: `Magda-LEE- na' or `Magda-LAY-na.' (back to me) No, we were after you. But thanks for the name. 
 ME (CONT'D) First punch you ever thrown Noonan? Your Mom have to teach you how because Dad was the same no-chin, Connecticut Faggot you are? 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) I think I hit the Noonan family dynamic, dead-on. 
 (O.C.) Drop him. 
 #1 (O.C.) You don't want to take him in? 
 (O.C.) I only want to bring him in when I know he'll never leave. 
 Ice. Bradley's on his way down. 
 That's mine...you needed some                        * mopping up. 
 I did. I got there at eleven like you said, right as two black & white's pulled up: you were out                      * cold in a gutter `round the block.                   * (this blithe little grin) Did Noonan knock you out? 
 (a nod to Koenig) The Captain was the only one here at this hour...                                      * 
 If I need your help later on, can I count on it? 
 Of course you can. 
 KOENIG (CONT'D) Chief. 
 What are you doing here? 
 The Lieutenant was thirsty. 
 Progress on Magdalena. 
 No fingerprints. Clean crime scene. Canvassed the neighborhood. A senile neighbor did report a possible Peeper- 
 Is that who knocked you out? 
 (beat) He's having you tailed then... 
 She knows someone watches? 
 That's immaterial.                                     * 
                                    * -did you confirm their alibi?                        * 
                            * I spoke with a Mr. and Mrs. Preston                  * Mott of Santa Barbara, the parents                   * of Madge Magdalena nee Mott and                      * they've confirmed their visit and                    * also corroborated the argument that                  * resulted in them leaving early.                      * 
                                    * (back to me now)                                 * One alteration to my previous orders- 
                                    * Step out Stemmons.                                   * 
 BRADLEY (CONT'D)                           * No direct approach on the mother or                  * the daughter.                                        * 
                                    * If you do so directly, if they're                    * formally questioned then Noonan may                  * find out and go after them with Federal warrants. 
                               * Yes he will, so we buy time, keep him busy- 
 Until Tom Bethune votes on the floor of the city council in two days, ratifying the official start of construction on Dodger stadium- 
 Don't be dramatic, it looks weak. Right now, Noonan needs a pursuit, so I supply him with one-                       * 
 -you've been drawing him off. And the more he sees you the less he'll think of anything other than getting you. Now find Tommy and                 * take him alive. Do not let Noonan               * get to him. As a potential major                * case witness against the LAPD,                  * Tommy Magdalena isn't just a powder-            * keg, he's an atom bomb.                         * 
 I give you the shirt off my back                        * and you bash me!                                        * 
 I made a file on the Bledsoe broad. The one you asked about. 
 I spent a whole day putting it together and this skirt's got skeletons. 
 Why is it not important? 
 -what about Magdalena? 
 (picks up Glenda's file) -is Ainge related to this Cunt? 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) This jet-engine urge to see her. Needing it like a junkie does. No logic. Just the push. 
 Better looking than the last guy Howard hired. Once you heal. (she recognizes me) Wait a minute. You were there, the other night, the Bethune Party...                     * 
 Mickey told me this `Bent Cop' everybody used to call- (mocking, I love it:) -`The Enforcer' was asking about me. Told me to be careful. So you're LAPD after all... 
 You're going to arrest me for breaking and entering? 
 Everything's Howard's. 
 That's why I left. 
 Some of our extras haven't had a vegetable since Truman. 
 (smiles, no flinch) We can't all be Audrey Hepburn. Plus it pays bills. 
 Not if there was just one day left on it. 
 I'm better than that. 
 This isn't the first time you've spied on me. 
 (beat) Well you've got me all giftwrapped, Enforcer- 
 -Glenda. (this smile just for me) And tell Howard I'll take my chances with the fake vampires. 
 Message from a Lester Lake: asked that you contact him immediately. 
 ME (CONT'D) (push this out pronto) -this is LAPD-put Lester on the phone or I'll have your liquor license and after-hours permits yanked inside the hour...

 Parker appreciates Bradley's political skills...and the addition of a professional Ball-club to our fare city fulfills his own personal mandate of a cleaner, brighter, LA. 
 Stale milk to me too. And how are you faring? Is our visiting U.S. Attorney still in hot pursuit?

 Impossible. 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) But it wasn't a Federal Subpoena. Wilhite was being called to testify by Bob Gallaudet, a man who doesn't piss without Bradley's say-so. (beat) Bradley trying to beat Noonan to the punch and burn the LAPD himself...why? 
: 
:        * 
 (O.S.) -Junior's left the fucking planet. 
 Yeah. I swung by his apartment, car was out front. I scoped it: a sawed- off shotgun in front, canned tuna in the back seat. Think he's living outta that car. After he left, I tried to get inside his place: The front door is triple pad-locked. 
 -the what? 
 I'll bring `em. 
 Who's car is that? 
 Junior looked real skeezed this morning. Like he was on a dope jag. 
 Sweated up like a stuck pig. And be careful. He was fucking around with his front door before he left. I don't know what he was doing. 
 (handing me bolt-cutters) What about this Bledsoe broad? Milteer has called me twice. 
 Asshole! 
 Stay right here. I'll get it all and come back. Don't move. 
 ME (CONT'D) Civil servants can't afford manicures? 
 Breaking and entering, theft, and willful destruction of private property...and I'll add attempted murder to the current first degree murder charge I'm about to file against you. 
 Where are the files you stole from Sergeant Richard Stemmons. 
 Oh I don't need his testimony Klein. I'll just force yours. 
 Sanderline Johnson, your links to Sam Giancana to Mickey Cohen, extortion, bribes, murder-for-hire. I'll put you in every pair of cross- hairs I can find. I'll torch everything you've ever touched. You have no idea how deep I run Klein. And how far I'm willing to go to fuck you- 
 You're all angles and graft Klein. Why trust a God damn word that comes out of your- 
 (thrown) Prelims: drug pusher gone missing, presumed dead, we're investigat- 
 AND? 
 I don't believe you'd turn. Treacherous yes, traitorous no. Tell me where Stemmons' files are. 
 You're not leaving here Klein. 
 I'll take it. 
 What happened to Wilhite? 
 Like Sanderline Johnson? 
 Agreed. 
 After a judge signs it. Now Leave. 
 #1 Tail him? 
 No. Let him get comfortable...let him believe me. 
 I know what Feds look like -- those were Feds with Junior... 
 Barter what? 
 You what? 
 What did you do to his place? Nice quiet neighborhood one minute, Nagasaki the next. 
 Few more hours. Maybe. Junior didn't skimp on this thing. I gotta bore right through the face plate. (beat) You got some time now, why don't you get Milteer off my back and go work that Bledsoe broad. 
 Where would I start? 
 Why L.A.? (this amazing smile) Why is anybody here? Want the rest of the world to know who they are. 
 No...I don't think so. (beat) I just love it. I grew up in Seattle. My aunt, every week, she'd take me to the movies. 
 Hughes told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago. Movie with Gregory Peck at Universal. He thought he was humoring me...until I got it. They offered me the role...there in the room. So Howard, who I'm sure never thought in a million years I'd land that part, makes some phone calls and just like that they don't want me anymore. (beat) Nobody calls now. I can't get in to see any studio casting people. He's ruined me in those circles. 
 -bad enough to put on a silly cheerleading skirt and try to make the most god-awful dialogue sound decent. 
 Or desperation. Depends on the day. 
 He asked me to take his `niece and nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard. These beautiful, funny little kids. (tears she doesn't swipe) I dropped them off. Didn't ask any questions -- I believed Dwight. A week later I saw their pictures in the Post Office. A week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near San Pedro. (beat, tears stream) I'll never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought I was part of it. That I knew what was going to happen to them. So I pray to God that he let them look in when I put that knife into Dwight. (beat) But I'll never ask his forgiveness for doing it... (beat, clears her eyes) Why do they call you `Enforcer?' 
 ME (CONT'D) 33 for War. 2 for principle. 9 for profit -- mostly. Why did you sign with Hughes, knowing what he was? 
 `For profit -- mostly.' 
 Me neither. 
 (O.C.) The Knife ain't there. File on top of that middle pile: George Ainge in an `undisclosed locale.' 
 Junior documented everything like a fucking Monk. (pulls a file) Like here: `has evidence' you murdered Sanderline Johnson. (MORE) 
 In-case Stemmons made a house-call. He's got every goddamn address of everybody you know... (beat, hard) And you should've told me about the Bledsoe broad. 
 Then call Milteer about this dead Pimp Gillette. I'm no legal mind like you, but I'll bet a murder beef would violate her morals clause quick. (beat, hands phone) Collect the rest of your money. 
 Then give that five grand back. 
 People are gonna start lining-up to see you bleed, Pal. 
 (formal-frosty) Your young partner called me at my home, early this morning. 
 KOENIG (CONT'D) Heavily inebriated. Speaking inarticulately of `betrayal,' & how the LAPD was set to be `blitzed by justice.' Is this the `bind' of which we spoke earlier? 
 And his apartment -- there was some type of disturbance? A fire? 
 Only that he was in possession of materials that might deeply damage Chief Bradley...and yourself. 
 Let me try to locate the lad first Dave. Be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon. 
 (frowns at my informality) Out at the Ravine Lieutenant. 
 -this area has long been rife with crime and venality, but with a brand new Stadium, we can make this horrible blight a bright spot and give our Los Angeles Dodgers the home they deserve. (like Ruiz was an orphan) Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his travails growing up in this horrible slum and why now is the time to `Redeem The Ravine.' 
 #2 Chief Bradley, U.S. Attorney Noonan has promised to deliver surprise witnesses before the Federal Grand jury on- 
 -Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous hack politician whose smear campaign against us will fail, for he has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
 Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave you with Reuben Ruiz. 
 ME (CONT'D) (hand him Junior's file) Hurwitz Holdings. 
 ME (CONT'D) You, Bethune, and Gallaudet bought big chunks of Chavez Ravine over the past two years through a shell company called Hurwitz Holdings. (beat, look around) If the Dodgers move here the value of the land booms...you could sell it off for a fortune -- or hang onto it and make even more. The parking lots alone would make you all multi-millionaires. 
 How? 
 Why would he investigate me? 
 Where is Stemmons? 
 I'll issue an A.P.B. saying Stemmons is a known deviant targeting kindergarten children. 
 How do y- 
 ME (CONT'D) You're going after Narco yourself. 
 Exposing the corrupt parts of the LAPD will redeem the whole. I'll prove that Police can police themselves- 
 No Cop will testify against other Cops. This is why Wilhite has suddenly disappeared. 
 (beat, eyes flick again to the files I'm holding...) There are other forces at work here...faces we need to identify. Names we need to know. A third party. (MORE) 
 No. It ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that Stemmons file. Which I know you won't do until you figure out how it will best benefit you. 
 SIX-PACK Something in your trunk smells to high hell Lieutenant. 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Borrowed time burning fast. My days are done. Only hours remain. Whatever moves I have left...make them now. 
 Fucking Christ. You can't keep that car in the garage, the smell's coming into the house. 
 Open the windows. 
 That's not gonna help. 
 What do you got in there? 
 I'm going to work. 
 (God damn glowering) I'm taking her. 
 ME (CONT'D) What? 
 Hughes. 
 It's more than that. 
 That you made mine. 
 Look as bad as I've ever seen you. 
 ME (CONT'D) Klein. 
 MOTHERFUCKER -- you better meet me! That Cooze you threw everything away for is still cooked! I got the knife. I got Ainge- 
 I got everything on you! AND I'M GONNA USE IT! 
 The knife for MY file on Bradley. I know you already burned that Whore's but don't think I can't re- do investigations. 
 Fuck Noonan. I got stronger Allies. 
 Meet me in one hour with that file, Fern Dell Park- 
 Be there with Bradley's file or I scratch your scabby Bitch. 
 ME (CONT'D) -I see anybody near there Junior, the deals off and I gift that file to Bradley to fuck you with- 
 -Dave? 
 Sorry...you gave me this number... 
 Who were you talking- 
 Was it him? The Cop you were telling me about? 
 You don't think it's safe? 
 I wish you would've woken me up this morning. 
 ME (CONT'D) Stay by the phone. 
 I miss you. 
 Not much with these sub-rosa things... 
 Bradley's greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side. 
 ME (CONT'D) Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not Narco. 
 When did you know? 
 He was offering to exonerate Hector and clear his criminal record. Hector met with Wilhite and I to inform us of his decision... 
: 
 (V.O.) ...to accept Bradley's deal... 
 KOENIG (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and although the terms of that deal worked well for him. I found them less than favorable... 
 Darktown. Chavez Ravine. Hot Spots for Human Vice. These are slums I run & profit from. If these slums suddenly become Stadiums, that profit goes elsewhere...that crime goes elsewhere. 
 I was aware of his sexual predilections. 
 (that great white grin ) We share an eye for human frailty and we're both born blackmailers Dave. (beat) I knew young Stemmons here had a fondness for Lads, stretching back to his days at the academy. 
 JUST YOU! YOU FUCK! 
 (turning his back) I don't want to watch...I'm sorry it came to this, Dave. 
 I hope the Bledsoe whore was worth it...'cuz she's still fucked. For a crooked cop, you think small. 
 This isn't it! 
 Poorly played Dave...poorly played... 
 Could I talk you into something? Cut you in on something? 
 Give me a minute then? 
 (with a nod) Okay... 
 Who? 
 (going pale) Where? 
 Why are you here? 
 Things like? 
 This body is in your possession? 
 What will this cost? 
 Doubtful. 
 Wilhite's body...Bury it. 
 Where's Glenda, is she asle- 
 ME (CONT'D) Don't kill me. 
 The harder you hit him the quicker I say `stop' -- and cease that absurd crying. 
 (at Milteer) THAT IMPOTENT SHIT- 
 -touch me and he dies. 
 MILTEER (CONT'D) Kick him-kick him-kick him. 
 MILTEER (CONT'D) (prim, official) -you may stop. (beat, for the room) Howard determined that this was the price for your time together. 
 You still have a job. 
 ...I'm sorry Dave... 
 -there's a body in the trunk- 
 I'm so sorry.... 
 Let me take you to a hospital. 
 (big beat) I'm worried. 
 I don't believe you. 
 GLENDA (CONT'D) (at a whisper) Was I worth this? 
 Just like that then? 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) "My Heaven: the hours I had with you. My Hell: the years ahead, without. Someday I'll see you before you even know I'm looking." 
: 
 ...be nice to be in with a billionaire who's got a fleet of planes, fly you outta the country on short notice... 
: 
 ME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding her name. Only a photograph, yellowed with years-passed, reminding me of everything I never was. (beat) Then a week-old Times at the place I buy coffee. Her picture sees me before I realize she's looking. Her Face eternal-beautiful...

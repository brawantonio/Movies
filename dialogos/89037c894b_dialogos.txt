 
 
 (off) See here. This is what you need to look for. 
 (continuing; off) A genetic mutation, we all carry it. But we now know a virus activates it. 3 
 (continuing) This Virus plays some unknown role in the birth the Brothers. Of course the mutation occurs very rarely these days. And only in males. 
 (continuing) Strange isn't? 
 That God would choose such humble vehicle for a miracle. The mothers invariably come from the slums, we don't know why. (to the woman) This is your 7th isn't it? 4 
 (continuing) Yes, her first was successful, a Brother was born. Thereafter variously malformed offspring. We can only hope this one will be different. (to woman) You'll have to try harder this time. 
 What is it? 
 Don't be stupid woman! 
 This is your brother Silus. You will teach him. 
 No, not any more. 
 (continuing) Welcome to the world little Brother. 
 The girl? 
 
 This is good. 
 Augustus. We failed this girl. We asked her to help us catch him, and then we failed her. 
 Yes. But her death served a greater good. Every trap needs bait. 
 (continuing) Are you sure you won't join me? 
 Perhaps this is beyond us. Perhaps we should inform the authorities. The human beings. 
 For now the Brothers feel we should deal with this ourselves. 10 
 If they find out we are covering up these deaths... 
 Which is why you must find him. Silus. 
 (continuing) For centuries we Brothers have served mankind and them us. The great union. But remember your history. 300 years ago when our kind were first born into this world they burnt our children as monsters. They had no notion of evolution. In another world we might all have been slaughtered, only to be remembered in myth, monsters to frighten the young or a puzzle for anthropologists. We must refuse to let one aberrant individual destroy the balance between the two races. The old prejudices are still there. Human beings are paranoid creatures by nature. 
 Perhaps they have good reason. 
 Silus. Simply concern yourself with finding Edgar. Find your Brother so that we can help him. Before he kills again. 
 Everyone's ready Lilly. 
 (to the woman) Don't you move! 
 God help us. What an appalling sight. 
 I don't know nothing about it. I give 'em out. Make sure everyone gets 'em. 
 That's a lie! We know you've been trading influenza vaccine in the workhouses! 
 Lil'. I think you should see this. 
 I'd use the mask if I were you. 
 You're a fucking liar! 
 No, no, I swear it, I gave 'em their boosters, both of 'em. I'm a responsible landlord, I swear to god. There must've been something wrong with them vaccines. 
 This is a civil health violation! You're going to the hell house for this. You can forget lovely Doris here where you're going. 
 I don't know what you're on about. I've done nothing, I swear to god, I've done nothing. 
 I want my lawyer. 
 I want a lawyer! 
 Fuck you then. 
 Oi! How about me? He promised me some of that. I earned it. 
 (hitting the horn) Come one! 
 Lil', you want some? 
 I'm not letting that scum put me off my food. That'd be like a moral victory. 
 You sure? 16 
 (continuing) What's up with her? 
 (continuing) Jones? Is she alright? 
 Yeah. Lilly's kid. It died of the influenza, didn't it. 
 She's never said anything about a kid. 
 No. She never says anything. 
 Hey?! Hey! 18 
 Don't, I didn't do nothing. It was a Brother. It was a Brother did it. 
 300 years ago, with these simple instruments, the alchemist Guiseppi De Angelo discovered what we today call genetic science. 19 
 (continuing) He deciphered that the Brothers were a new race of beings, sent by god, to serve and protect you. 
 (continuing) De Angelo formed the church of the Brotherhood. He was a great great man, but there were others, bad men, who took what De Angelo had discovered and experimented without concern for the results. The science of genetics and all its power has been banned ever since. Who can tell me what came from these bad experiments? 
 (continuing) Yes. 
 All the bad things. Like bad germs and flu. 
 Yes. That's right. 
 (continuing) All the bad things. 
 Someone should flatten this cesspool and start again. 
 Marm? The Tribune. Do you have any comments on the death? 
 They're saying it was a Brother, is that true? 
 With the traffic. What's it matter. 21 
 Lil'. 
 Have you seen it? 
 (continuing) It's a bite. If you know what I mean? 
 (to forensics team) Where do you get a cup of tea around here? 
 (continuing) There's a kid who saw it, down there. 22 
 (continuing) Says it was a Brother. And they've got another fellow, that's all who saw it. 
 1 Now he wont talk. Didn't see anything. 
 (nervous) Albert. 
 (surprised) You did? 
 A man. 
 A Brother. 
 He had teeth and everything. 24 
 He went straight up there. 
 Now they'll all want feeding. 
 What about the telephonic companies? 
 Sit, sit. 
 (continuing) You've done well Lilly. The reporter is more of a problem. We have 2 days by law before we have to release her. Then it's out. 
 (continuing) I hate these things. I'm like a pin cushion. 
 I need you to stay with this, Lilly. You know Jamestown better than anyone, how to handle the people. 
 (continuing) The Brothers have requested to be involved with the investigation. 
 You have a problem with it? 
 Good. I think they can help. And I don't want someone working on this whose got something against the Church. 
 Lilly, you're the least prejudiced person I know. In fact, you're the only one I know. That's important. The church is powerful, but more than that, people's faith in the Brotherhood is about all they've got these days. And the government knows it. Even the Queen herself is involved. This is political. 
 Lil'. He's here. 27 
 Do you know who he is? That's Brother Silus. They say one day he will lead the Brotherhood. He's a great man. 
 I think I hear choir music. 
 Do you respect anything? 
 Hey. My old mum goes to church four times a week and gives blood. She's happy as a lark. Just don't expect me to kiss him, that's all I'm telling you. 
 A matter of weeks. 
 (continuing) Is there something wrong? 
 You're right to not like it. It is political. 
 (continuing) We thought we could find Brother Edgar ourselves. We were wrong. But now any debate is pointless. 
 (continuing) The greatest danger is if this were to become public knowledge. 
 It's more than that Captain. This is about prejudice, or rather the nature of it. As a female surely you would understand. 29 
 How many other Captains in this borough are female? 
 How are your actions judged, the same or differently from the men. 
 Exactly. If a white man kills, then he is just a killer. If a black man kills, then all black men are suspect. That is the nature of prejudice. Those who are different are grouped together. If only one Brother does a bad thing then all Brothers are suspect, because we are different. And then what would this world be like, if there was no hope? 
 First, there is something you should hear. 
 There's no chance. Not a hope in hell. 
 He's right. We don't even know where to begin. 
 Thank you Captain. Could we have the plate? 31 
 (continuing) Senior Brother Edgar. Until 3 weeks ago, he was a trusted and talented theologian and scientist. 
 What'd he do? 
 He was personally responsible for developing the most recent influenza antivirals. It is because of him that most of you are alive today. His behavior appeared normal. Next. 
 (continuing) The victims. John Anderson. Julie Danes. Tanya Garfield. All in their early 20's, but beyond that no obvious connection. Next. 
 (continuing) There is no precedent for Brother Edgar's behavior. No Brother has ever taken a human life, not in the 300 years since we began. Not one. Our role has been to preserve and maintain the human life. Not take it. 
 Next he'll be wanting an fucking medal. 
 What I am saying to you is that Brother Edgar's behavior is aberrant. We 32 
 (cont) don't understand it. And therefore it's difficult to predict. The only thing we know is where he will strike next. 
 How do you know? 
 (off, like to a lover) Quiet. 
 (off) I said shut up! 
 Fuck! 
 Why are we listening to this?! 
 (off) Good. Now you're quiet. 
 (continuing; off) Did you hear that Silus? I hope so. 
 (continuing; off) The next one will be tomorrow. There is a square, Bridge Square it's called. I will take the next one from there. You should try harder this time. Please try harder... 
 He sent this to you. Specifically. 
 We share the same mother. There is a bond. 
 What? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 He will come. 
 This is a dud. 
 Yeah Lil'. 
 Not a thing. 
 You heard her. Once more for the empire. 
 Shoo. 
 Lil'! Lil'! 
 (off) He's on the sixth floor! He's on the sixth floor! 
 Lil'. 40 
 (continuing) Fuck! 
 You're so strong. 
 Lilly! 
 (continuing) Oh shit shit. 
 Lilly's hurt. She's hurt! 
 (continuing) He's in the ventilation shaft! 41 
 She's dying! She's fucking dying! 
 (continuing) Get away from her! 
 (continuing) Get away or I'll stick you! 
 Do you want me to save her? 
 (continuing) She is dying. 
 (continuing) Lilly. Stop fighting now. Fall back, fall back... 
 He's getting away!! 
 Quiet. 43 
 (continuing) He's going up. 
 Get out of my way. 
 No. 
 He killed Lilly. 
 (continuing) Bang. 46 
 We all caught Edgar. 
 Sometimes the rituals call for it. Some say they have visions from it. That it restores their health. 47 
 In some ways my body is like a human embryo. The cells regenerate quickly. It is why we live so long. Will someone come for you? Your family? 
 I see. 
 I am sorry. 
 No. Fragile. Worn down by nature. But you fight back. 48 
 I think yours will be a good life to watch, Lilly. Goodbye. 
 Nicely done. You're more human than I thought. 
 Silus. You know Professor Liepsky. 
 How is he? 
 See for yourself. 
 Is the brace necessary? 
 He decapitated a guard as they brought him in. Even though he was sedated. He said he will drink us all dry. 
 Insane then. 50 
 Not quite. 
 (continuing) He's become infected. 
 With what? 
 Go on, Brother Silus will soon be part of the inner circle of the Brotherhood. He should know this. 
 If she wasn't restrained she would try to kill you. Don't worry, it's only transmissible through their blood. We designed it that way. 
 Designed? 51 
 Genetically designed. Edgar was experimenting with the virus that created you. It was sanctioned by the government. 
 Since when do they sanction such things? 
 Since not one Brother has been born in 70 years. And never a female of your kind from which we could breed. And we need to breed more Brothers. You give the world hope. To the people you're like gods walking the earth. 
 This is what Edgar was doing Silus. Trying to genetically control the birth of Brothers. 
 And Edgar was successful. Each of these women carried a Brother, for a time. But, the virus... changed. Most of them have died and these will die soon. 
 (continuing) And Edgar may be the first Brother to ever die. 52 
 (continuing) Before that, his brain will wither like these women. Containment will be the issue. 
 (off) The police officer. Lilly. Did he infect her with this? 
 (off) No. She was lucky. But it is in Edgar's blood. It always will be. 
 Hello my Brother. 
 Do you like what they've done for me Silus? 
 You are sick. We will help you if we can. 
 Help me? I am being what I was meant to be. How can you help me from that? Or do you want to tame me? Brainwash me? Animal or vegetable, are those the two choices, Silus? 
 (continuing) I want to share the feeling with you. To feel their blood flow until every last drop is yours, until that weak, pointless little pump finally stops. 
 (continuing) The one I had, the police woman. She was so strong. I found it hard to leave her. 
 (continuing) Is she dead? 
 She survived. 
 Good. I will have her again. 
 You won't touch her. 54 
 You've chosen to watch over her. You want her don't you? I can see it in your eyes. You are like me. 
 I will pray for your cure, Brother. 
 I wont be able to forgive you for this you know? Not ever. In fact, when I get out of here... 
 (continuing) I will make you see. I will show you the way. I will see you drink your little police woman right through. 
 1 I don't like it when he does that. 
 2 (scolding Edgar; into microphone) You stop that or we'll use the gas! 
 You don't feel like a drink? 
 (continuing) Now my girls, anyone hungry? 
 (off) If you don't stop that we'll use the gas. You hear me? 
 (off) I knocked. 
 What's this then? 
 My apartment was condemned, keep your hair on, what's left of it. 
 ...the ascension through the ranks of the Church has been fast for Brother Silus. He will now be the highest ranking cardinal outside the ruling council of the Brotherhood. This is largely seen as a reward for his handling of the last influenza pandemic. 
 Isn't he amazing? 
 A saint. 
 You have been an opponent of those who want an easing in the ban on genetic research. 
 Yes. 
 They would say you're denying legitimate research into a science that would change the world. 
 The church does not deny the potential. Only the motivations of those who want to exploit it. And the fact that we understand so little of its power. 
 With the elimination of influenza, are we approaching a new era where disease might be a thing of the past? 
 Disease is part of nature, it will always be a part of our lives. 
 How true. 
 (off) Brother Silus' confirmation ceremony will be held today in the sacred Chapel of St. Augustine where all the Brotherhood will gather. 
 THRU                                                             THRU 69                                                             69 
 I turned off the lights to try and calm him... 
 (continuing) We gassed him as usual. We waited 10 minutes. He must have held his breath. 
 The blood flows, through them, to us and we preserve them, preserve the blood we are bound to protect. 
 Let the blood be one and the two races join, as the Perfect Creature. 
 Today my brother enters the history books, Professor. 
 (over the tannoy) Move back! 
 Tonight all the Brothers will be with him. A perfect day for me to celebrate. 
 You won't be taking any more calls today. 
 Now he carries this thing out into the world. Can you imagine what will happen if he infects others? Or if the experiments were known. 
 The question becomes what will he do next? He said he would kill us all. But especially the police officer. Lilly. 
 Come on governor, you going to pay me or not? 
 Soon enough my cherub. I've not finished with you yet. 
 You've been ripping me off! I should blow your dirty little brains out! 
 (off) Police! Put the gun down now! 
 It's ok. I'm complying officer, see. 
 Put the gun on the ground and step away! 66 
 I'm doing it. 
 He's crazy! Fucking crazy! 
 (to the prostitute) Wait! (to Freddy) Down! Right now, down on the ground! 
 I'm getting wet now. 
 Shut up! 
 (continuing) Put your hands behind your back. 
 Sure. Anything you say. 
 Nice to meet you again. 
 What's wrong? 
 You brought me the wrong one. 
 Does it matter, one's as good as the next? 
 (continuing) You promised me some of that. 
 What do you see Freddy. Visions? Can you see your future? 
 Hey! 
 Don't be a greedy little pig Freddy. You have to earn more. 
 (continuing) We have more to do. 
 Holy brother, please... 
 Forgive me. I've offended you... 
 No. You are divine. It is the world that offends me. 
 (off) A shopkeeper heard yelling. Went to see, found this. One witness. A prostitute. 
 (continuing) She identified this lovely citizen. We thought maybe he had a grudge or was crazy. I guess we were wrong. 
 It is Edgar. 
 She is not what he was after. 
 Yes. He will come for you Lilly. 
 Right, then we put you somewhere safe and set up this place. Shooters on the roofs. And when he comes we blow his fucking brains out. 
 He will know. He will see and hear it. 72 
 What are you talking about, she's probably dead already... 
 Help me. Please, I'm sick. Help me. 
 Don't fucking touch me. 
 Hey! 
 (continuing) Where've you gone now? 
 What are you doing? 
 Stay here. 
 Get back here, Lilly! 
 You saved me... 
 (continuing) When will you admit it. You're just like me. 
 (continuing) Maybe you need some encouragement. 
 Lilly, wait! Damn you. Lilly! 
 The little policewoman. 
 Oh, I've killed her already. Essentially. 
 (continuing) Has he tasted you yet, little policewoman? 
 (continuing) He's just the same as me, you know it, you can feel it too. 
 We will see. You will be my tool. 
 You happy now? 
 You scared the shit out of me. Hey, the police woman. She's real sick. To tell the truth I don't feel so hot myself. 
 I want you to take her and put her where they'll find her. 
 But I'm sick. She's given me something... 
 What have I said to you? 
 (continuing) I hate arguments. 
 Stephanie Richards, you just brought her in. 
 Thank god you're here. 
 Will she recover? 
 No. Containment is the issue now. She is... insane. And we've had more cases, 10 in the last hour. 
 What is this? What is it? 
 It comes from Edgar. He has shared his blood with them. 
 You're telling me that he's out there spreading this around? 
 (continuing) He'll give it to Lilly! 
 Jones! Back off. 
 (continuing) This is spreading. 
 (continuing) Brother Silus? 
 That's it, Lilly's dead. 
 No. He will keep her alive. 
 Why? 
 So that I will come for him. That's what he wants. 
 It says, "Everything flows from me. My blood will change the world." What does that mean? 
 THRU                                                             THRU 103                                                             103 84 
 It almost sounds like children playing, don't you think? 
 I looked at your body. You have borne a child. 
 (continuing) Did you abandon it? Your kind are good at that. 
 I can see why he likes you. But I have a better use for you. To save you, Silus will take my blood. Join me. 
 The world is insane. I am better than you. But they force me to serve you. Does that happen in a sane world? Forced to watch you waste the most precious thing you have. Life. 
 (continuing) Do you know what they do to us when we are born? They take us from our mothers. Force us into a life of loneliness, and denial. Can you imagine a life like that? 
 You have reminded me of something. 
 (continuing) I must search out my mother, if she still lives. And kill her for what she did. 86 
 (off) Some say this plague is the result of genetic experimentation, by the Brothers. Do you have a comment? 
 (off) We're asking everyone to stay in their homes in the sections of Jamestown now under quarantine. 
 (off) There are reports of residents being shot trying to escape the quarantine zone. Is that true? They say the Queen has left the city... Is this martial law? 
 We've blocked off this section, and here, containing the Jamestown slums. 
 (off) Do you like the world I am making for us, Silus? I haven't had your little policewoman yet. But I will soon. You'll just have to find me. You know where I am. Everything flows from me. Remember that... 
 The infection is spreading. Each day he shares his blood with more of them. Even though they are locked in their homes. 89 
 He is somewhere in the quarantine zone. I will find him. 
 Clear. So very clear your eyes. The way they were when you were born. There will be no search. 
 No search? 
 The Queen has instructed the government to evacuate the city around the quarantine zone. In another day they will take action. 
 What kind of action? 
 Eradication. Of everything within the area. They will burn it all. Including Edgar. 
 And the innocents there, who are not infected? 
 It is a necessary step. We cannot let this escape. 
 No! 
 Is it the policewoman? Is this affecting your thinking? There is no love for our kind Silus. Only service. 
 We have done this. Released this thing into the world. We have betrayed their trust in us, more than once. I won't do it again. 
 There is no debate. They will be sacrificed, so the rest will be pure. 
 (continuing) This policeman, Jones. He talked to the press. Told them this came from Edgar. 
 (continuing) There are members of the inner circle who question the way you have handled this. Blame you for this man's actions. I have made it clear that you will fix this. That you will silence him. 
 (continuing) These are hard things we do. But you must think of the greater good. And of your own future. 
 Great. 
 (continuing) Come on then... 
 What do you want? 
 I want to help you. They know you talked to the press. 
 They can fuck off. For that matter, so can you. 
 (continuing) You'd be the last person I'd trust. 
 Why? 
 I saw you. Remember. Watching Lilly, when she was asleep. 
 (continuing) Maybe you're just like your Brother. Maybe you're helping him. Now there's a thought. 
 (continuing) Do you know where she is? 
 (continuing) You've changed. Not the outside. But inside. I know you. You know what, I can see myself? 
 (continuing; sneering) Coffee's ready. 
 (off) You know where I am. Everything flows from me... 
 Do you have a map? 
 There's the quarantine zone. It's a pit. Slums. 
 The water supply. Where is it? 
 There, all the old suburbs are supplied by their own artesian wells. Mineral springs. That's why it hasn't broken out of Jamestown, it's the water. Jamestown's water. 
 He is there, with Lilly. 
 You'll never get in, they've circled the whole borough. 
 I will get in. You must go to the press. Tell them about the water. Tell them what the government will do. 
 You're dead after this. You know that? Whatever happens. 
 Watch for me, Officer Jones. 95 
 2 Who has done this, Brother? 
 We have. To our shame. 96 
 2 I have something to show you. 
 2 It is a miracle my Brother. She is a female, the first of our kind. 
 She must be protected. 
 (continuing) I would ask for your help Brother. The Church can no longer be trusted... 
 He's coming little one. He's coming for you. 
 Lilly? 
 It is a maze down here. But given time, that thing will find her. Do things to her. I'll show you where she is, if you take some. 
 (continuing) You're almost there anyway. 
 If I burn the skin from your face, I wonder how that would be. If you looked like a monster... 
 In there. 
 No. 
 (continuing) There is something very precious. You must take it, keep it secret. Don't let them touch it. 
 You will. 105 
 (continuing) Hurry. 
 2 The first female of her kind. The first daughter given to us. 
 2 (continuing) Come. Before they find her. 
 2 We must go. 
 (VO) For me, everything has changed now. Because of Silus I see the world through new eyes. 
 (VO) Now I see hope, and I see a child, the first female of her kind. 
 (VO)

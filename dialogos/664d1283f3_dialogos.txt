 (looking ahead) Hey. 
 Cancel that. 
 (to someone O.S.) She says "I haven't eaten all day," then, right there on the bus she pulls out this, like, salmon steak and I'm... 
 MEN'S VOICES (O.S.) One, two, three... up. 
 MAN'S VOICE We'll get him later.  C'mon. 
 "...Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet, get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat...gonna lose your mind in..." 
 (turning) Yeah.  Could ya grab me those two by eights? 
 Hey Ted, I'm Howard. 
 More than I could normally afford, I'll tell ya. (seeing the camera) Hey!  What do you think you're you doing? 
 That was really cool.  It was like... watching "Cops". 
 You know, I don't want to bitch or anything, but you were supposed to take me along on that one. 
 I know you know this, but the sooner they think I can handle calls on my own, the sooner they'll kick you back down south. 
 That's... quite the fish. 
 Paul Barnell, Ted Watters. 
 Yes, Raymond.  You see, as I've already explained to Mr. Branch, he's been gone for five years now, and I thought it might be time to... move on. 
 ...cash in Raymond's policy. 
 I just thought, well, it's pretty unlikely he's still alive. My Dad always wanted us to be able to look after each other if anything should ever happen.  And to be frank, money's a little -- 
 Of course we are extremely sorry for your loss. 
 Hang on, hang on.  First off, how did you get my cell number?  (Beat)  Because it's for mechanical and medical emergencies only. 
 Yes, and that check went out a week ago.  I watched my secretary write it up. 
 Well I don't know.  I, I, I have no clue.  Could it possibly be a problem on your end?  So the electric company never makes a...  Look, I pay my bills.  I'm a Rotarian for goodness -- 
 (into the phone) Hello? 
 (at the sound) Jodie, no!  Not for dogs! 
 (into her headset) Psychic Pals.  How are you today... Mr. Williams? (pause - she listens) Well, we are all registered psychics here.  I just had a feeling you'd be calling.  What's up? 
 (to caller) Your TV remote control?  Okay. 
 It's stew.  I'm not sure it's still good. 
 They're concentrating. 
 I've decided from now on to ignore you when you're ignorant about my work.  And it's going very well thank you. (reconnecting to the caller) Mr. Williams, I'm seeing sofa cushions.  Do you have a sofa?  Good.  Glad I could help. 
 No, but I did crack that code problem.  You know how sometimes when you're running Beta versions you -- 
 There was a boo-boo, but I fixed it. (another call comes in) Psychic Pals, how are you today, Carol?  Now I thought we'd agreed God is everywhere, but not specifically in your coffee pot. 
 Jeez, Ted.  Do I tell you how to do your job? 
 Before you say anything else that may keep us from having sex ever again, let me ask you something... 
 That's why we keep trying.  Now, Love is Sacrifice test. (reading) If you were in a life raft with me and there was only enough water -- 
 (to the caller) Carol?  God says he's busy with a famine right now, but you should keep praying.  Cool. 
 It's just a stupid quiz. 
 Psychic Pals.  Is this the first time you've called us Mrs...? 
 Don't call it a scam. (to the caller - startled) Excuse me? 
 You've got to learn to channel that rage, Margaret. (to Ted - playful) You didn't just call this your living room, did you? 
 I feel someone you really care about, maybe even the love of your life, is being a real pain.  Now I need you to concentrate... 
 Morning Mr. Barnell.  Coffee? 
 Thanks Avis.  Looks good. 
 (O.S.) Well if we didn't have the weather what would we talk about?  Did you send the computer back? 
 Yeah, it was not working.  Any calls? 
 (O.S.) Just that fellow from Municipal Power and Electric.  I told him you sent the check in weeks ago, but some people don't like to listen. 
 Something... strange happened last night Avis. 
 (O.S.) What was that? 
 Did... you ever meet my brother Raymond? 
 (O.S.) The one who went missing? 
 Uh huh.  Well anyway last night there's a knock on the door and there's Raymond, just... standing there on the doorstep. 
 Didn't you have him declared...? 
 Dead?  No.  I mean, they said he hadn't been gone long enough. 
 (smiling warmly) Good thing in hindsight. 
 Lower 48.  Said he wanted to get away from the cold. 
 Where 'bouts? 
 (looking up) Sorry, what was that? 
 Where was he living? 
 Florida. 
 I've got an aunt down there.  Where 'bouts? 
 (blanking) A uh... small place.  By the beach. 
 Well that's great.  You and Mrs. Barnell will have some company for a bit I guess.  How is she? 
 Better, a little better.  Some days are better than others. 
 Collecting, Mrs. Barnell. 
 Daniel, you pussy little cocksucker.  I'll get my purse. 
 It's 12 dollars.  I missed you last time. 
 (O.S.) Jerk off... OK, jerk off, uhhuh... 
 Sure will.  Thanks. 
 I thought stuff didn't smell when it was frozen?  I don't know why we have to-- 
 Dave wants visual confirmation, he gets visual confirmation.  We have a chance to move up here, so let's just-- 
 Like the guy's not gonna end up in a land- fill, anyway.  You ever ask Dave what he did? 
 Whatever it was, he told him if he did it again, he'd snap his neck. 
 (smiling) Whoops, he did it again. (off Jimbo not getting it) The song?  From that girl? 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 Not here. 
 Don't even joke.  Maybe the trash was emptied. 
 Looks pretty full.  Hey... (ducking down) There's a little fridge down here. (standing) If we would have shot him at least we'd know for sure. 
 I was following orders.  And if you hadn't started a screaming match, no one would have called the cops and we wouldn't have had to dump his -- 
 Fine.  Sorry. 
 Fine. 
 I'm just saying... maybe you didn't break it all the way. 
 (walking away) It was broken. 
 I'm just saying... maybe it was like hypothermia and he just looked dead. 
 It - was - BROKEN! 
 (O.S.) Paul?  Why is the fridge in the garage chained shut? 
 How's my Angel tonight? 
 Blow me.  Dinner's almost ready.  You feel like some wine?  I feel like some wine. 
 Sweetie, here's a crazy thought... I don't feel like chicken tonight, why don't we order in? 
 Fuck it, okay. 
 There's actually something we need to talk about. It's about Raymond.  He's back. 
." 
 (a little drunk) Okay, I never thought it would last this long, but seeing as how it has... There ya go.  Let me just say that my brother, old "Puddles McBarnesy" did better than he should have. 
 What'cha saying there Raymond?  Wha'cha saying 'bout me? 
 Enough, OK? 
 (sing-songy) Ray's a little jeallllllllous.  This is the one that got away, right Ray? 
 (O.S.) Leave him alone, ball licker! 
 And shut that thing -- 
. 
 That's okay, don't worry about it. (as the waiter walks off) I'd like the next one in a cup, please. 
 (to himself) Raymond... Barnell. 
 Which one's your sister's kid? 
 See the one on the little bike-thing?  Him. 
 (hesitant) You been alright with this? 
 The thing with the guy?  Ya know, I thought it might kinda mess me up... 
 First time for both of us. 
 ...but I've been sleeping really well. 
 Yeah.  'Course, you didn't actually... 
 Leggo... it's mine.  Uncle Gary! 
 (to Jimbo) Wait a minute.  He's disappeared? 
 (shouting) You just... hang in there, Billy! 
 Yeah.  But he's dead.  I mean, that part, no question. 
 Yeah?  Take off your coat.  And your shirt, too. 
 I'm not wearing a wire, Dave, if that's what this is about. 
 It was our first time.  No one gets it perfect their first time. 
 You too, Sweetie. 
 Excuse me for a second. 
 Gary!  We're in the middle of something. 
 (calling back) Hey, I'm supposed to be looking after him. 
 Is he...? 
 He's fine.  Look, we can take you there right now. We'll show you. 
 Show me what?  An empty trash dumpster?  It was supposed to look like an accident.  I was hoping to see it in the paper.  So help me, if this guy pops up somewhere... 
 He won't.  He can't.  He's -- 
 Proof, Jimbo.  I like to know my money's well spent. You got a week. 
 Slippery little sucker.  You mind if we stop at a toy store on the way back? 
 (to himself) Let's see if anyone's missing you. 
 (nervous) He's not here, is he? 
 Sweetie, don't you worry about Raymond. 
 When he's around, it just brings back... Fuck. 
 I know.  He, he said he's probably gonna head back down South soon. 
 MRS. WHERRY Paul?  Thank you so much for clearing the drive way. That was most considerate. 
 I'm afraid I don't understand Mrs. Wherry. 
 MRS. WHERRY You were out at the cabin this morning.  Nice to see you getting some use out of that thing. 
 Oh I see.  No, you see that must have been Raymond.  (beat) Very much so.  No, no one was more surprised than we were. (beat)  No, he's... indisposed right now, but I'm sure you'll see him again.  He's going to stay at the cabin for a while until he... leaves.  And bless you too. 
 "...It was my own lovely lady, and she said, oh it's you..." 
 Well come on!  How much easier do I have to make this? 
 Paul? 
 (startled) Holy-- Margaret, you scared the wits out of me. 
 She just wants that bacon. 
 Such a little puppy.  How late is "Rudys" open? 
 (really bad British accent) You may want to take a gander.  You may want to take a gander... 
 Sorry about this part. 
 (looking at the ridge) If it's any comfort to you, he likely wasn't eaten while conscious.  Did he say where he'd been living, before he came home? 
 Florida.  He didn't really talk about it much.  He brought us this shell. 
 --for dead, yes sir. 
 How did you...? 
 Anonymous phone tip from some Jamaican guy. (Paul shows no reaction) Said he saw what looked like a body.  We tracked you through his ID. 
 Just like on TV. 
 Mr. Barnell,  I should warn you, an animal  attack isn't pretty.  There's not much left. 
 They chewed his ears off.  What kind of animal does something like that? 
 Normally I'd say bear, but these tracks and the feeding pattern indicate wolf.  It's rare, but it can happen. 
 Coroner found some smaller bite marks on the ankle. 
 Pups.  Must have been the whole freakin' pack. 
 You want an autopsy? 
 On what? 
 Derek found this. 
 Not the smartest snack for a hiker. 
 Messy animals aren't they? 
 Messy.  Messy messy messy messy. 
 Yup. 
 (hugging him harder) Nope. 
 Must be all this talk about using your wood. 
 Secret? 
 I like it when you try, though. 
 So how many insurance companies are there in the United States?  Like, a billion. 
 And when it happens, I guess I'll just be another notch on your briefcase. 
 (smiling/shouting) Sorry, what was that!  You want to take me right here? 
 Your Mom? 
 On a Saturday?  What about the first annual golf, sex and pizza triathlon? 
 We don't need a ticket. 
 That's him.  Raymond Barnell. 
 Ouch.  That's gotta hurt. 
 Just what it looks like.  Wolves got him. Maybe a grizzly with insomnia, but we didn't find any tracks. 
 You trying to tell me Mr. Barnell chewed off his brother's leg? 
 Mr. Watters, this is a nice simple ending.  We like nice simple endings. 
 Ya know, I don't know thing one about insurance, but I'm guessing it's your job to find a way not to pay these poor people. 
 Hey now, we're just like you guys, gotta run down whatever leads we can find. 
 Mind telling me what you're doing? 
 They gave every claims team a video camera last quarter... you'd be amazed at how it cuts down on litigation.  We had this case two months ago where this mother of six was claiming... 
 I've got my own war stories, thanks.  You mind stopping that? 
 Your job?  Yes, I caught that. 
 You ready Mr. Barnell? 
 Yes. 
 The police told us what happened, how are you folks holding up? 
 (O.S.) Paul?  Who's out there? 
 Obviously, my wife's very upset... 
 (O.S.) Paul, the door's stuck! 
 (ignoring her) It's been a tough, you know, when something like this happens you just have to ask yourself... 
 (O.S.) Who fucked with the fucking door! 
 You can see how stressful it's been, I should really go now.  We have to plan a service. 
 Secondly, if the police say this guy was... 
 Eaten by wolves.  Sir. 
 (incredulous) Eaten by wolves, then we've got no case.  Did you see Mr. Barnell on the news last night?  Last thing we need is bad P.R.  I don't want this thing Valdeez-ing on us. 
 Corporate's view will be whatever I tell them. 
 Yes Sir.  Color us called off, as of now. 
 You've got a strange way of bucking for a promotion, my friend. (off Ted's look) Look, I'm gonna start on the Johnasen file.  You want to do up the paper work on Barnell? 
 At 9:30? 
 That's right, yes. 
 He'd go for walks.  Hikes, I mean.  Hiking. 
 Not sure I follow. 
 Can I ask why you need to know all this? 
 You know the police... they say Raymond died in the attack.  You do cover that sort of thing don't you? 
 Cod or Halibut? 
 Didn't ask. 
 (digging in) So we got six different stores here. We got your "Great Escapes" travel agency, your Ye Old Fish and Chips place, Porn-a-Copia videos, a hair place, one for lease and one... what is that? 
 Small engine repair.  See all the snow blowers out front. 
 So, which one you figure would want to take our friend? 
 I guess maybe the porn palace.  Ya know for some weird sex film. 
 Yeah, this place is just a hotbed of adult cinema production.  Fish shop look clean? 
 Very nice Korean family.  You figure maybe they battered him up? 
 Gary, this isn't a joke.  You ever known Dave to joke? 
 (O.S.) ...it could never happen.  There's never been a documented case-- 
 Sorry. 
 Yeah, "Sorry."  I get strip searched and you go off playing snow angels... 
 (O.S.) Well, we've got one now, don't we!? 
 (O.S.) That was different. From what I read in the paper he was unconscious. And now people are going to use this as an excuse to-- 
 (O.S.) Hey lady, why don't you tell Raymond Barnell how wolves have gotten a bad rap. 
 (O.S.) I can tell you from years of experience that wolves do not operate-- 
 Wait a minute. 
 (O.S.) You can tell me all you want, lady, but it is an undeniable, indisputable fact.  This Barnell guy got turned into a Scooby Snack by a pack of wild animals... 
 You start the month ends yet? 
 Oh God, you're not still on the Barnell thing are you-- 
 And?  Then?  So? 
 We're gonna get in such trouble. 
 No more Cam goes to the coffee room and Ted disappears for three hours? 
 And you'll work on your interpersonal skills? 
 Good.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go start covering your ass. 
 Hey.  How's my Princess? 
 OK.  I took some Adavan.  And called my psychic. 
 (picks up the phone bill) Honey, you know how expensive that is.  I thought we agreed that... 
 Don't be mad.  It's just... this week has been so... well with Raymond getting eaten by animals and someone trying to steal the fridge. 
 I know.  Why don't you -- 
 We got another letter from the HMO today. 
 Have you opened it yet? 
 I'm sorry.  It's just, fucking cocksuckers. 
 "As we have stated previously... usual onset before the age of 18... coupled with no genetic history..." 
 I'm sick!  I'm really, really sick! 
 Shush, now.  (reading again) "We hasten to add, Tourette Syndrome is not..." 
 Fuck them. 
 "As well, please reference our previous decisions regarding your claims for ADD, ODO, OCD, 
... (treading lightly) Honey.  I know you don't like to talk about it, but maybe it's not... what we might think it is but... maybe it's just stress?  Remember that cruise?  I saw you. You were happy. 
 They say you can't get it all of a sudden but I did.  I really, really did. 
 I know.  They just don't -- 
 I'll kill myself.  Then they'll see. 
 That is nonsense talk. 
 Then you can go off and... (sobbing again) ...marry someone normal. 
 You're the most normal girl I know. 
 I'm not crazy, Paul.  Something's really wrong with me. 
 I know, Sweetie.  I know.  And we're gonna find you the best specialists in... (a second, then confident) ...what you have that we can. 
 Promise? 
 I really think things are going to turn around.  Call me cr... I just have a feeling.  You just leave everything to me, OK?  Is that OK?  Leave everything to me?  I promise. 
 (gently) Shit bag. 
 That's my girl. 
 EDWARD G. ROBINSON "Every time one of these phonies comes along it ties knots in my stomach... I can't eat.  That's how I knew your claim was crooked..." 
 Hi there.  That'll be $12.97. 
 Doesn't apply when it's snowing. 
 It doesn't snow every day. 
 Would you just give him the money already? 
 It's not my decision. 
 Sure. 
 Absolutely. 
 Full disclosure to the pizza consumer. I'll be sure to pass that along. 
 Why you gotta argue with the service industry? 
 If this is another passive/aggressive shot at Psychic Buddies, all our ads state "for amusement purposes only." 
 You remember being amused, don't ya, honey? What is with you anyway? 
 So this is my fault? 
 EDWARD G. ROBINSON "What kind of outfit is this, anyway?  Are we an insurance company or a bunch of dim-witted amateurs to write a policy on a mug like that?" 
 You know, even though Edward G. Robinson wins, everyone like Fred MacMurray better. 
 MRS. WHERRY It was terrible.  Just terrible. Raymond should have known better. 
 MRS. WHERRY Greatest sport on earth.  Moved to a compound bow two years ago. (whisper) Arthritis.  Less draw weight. 
 MRS. WHERRY No.  Only saw him the once.  Never spoke.  Waved to him. 
 MRS. WHERRY He was clearing my driveway.  Raymond was a real hellcat when he was younger.  But like they say, time mellows even the hardest soul. 
 MRS. WHERRY I thought it was Paul at first.  Have you met Paul's wife?  Now there's a story.  Not that I'm much for gossip, but I think Raymond used to have a -- 
 MRS. WHERRY Sorry.  Did Raymond like the outdoors.  Not so much, no.  Liked living out here at the cabin, though. I think he had some friends on the police force. Have you talked to them?  They'd pull up here day and night, always looking for -- 
 MRS. WHERRY Well in a ski mask you can hardly tell who's who. Now, how 'bout some jerky?  I've got it drying out back. 
 Now, now.  Let's not forget who's pulling double duty. 
 Much better.  So? 
 Ya know, not having a credit history isn't actually a crime.  People around here have been known to swap a snow mobile for 500 pounds of venison. Doesn't exactly leave a paper trail. 
 Wow.  Less than nothing. 
 No it's not... in my humble, junior investigator's opinion. 
 When someone is taken from us at such a young age we often ask ourselves, why?  What possible purpose could this serve? 
 We should have checked the funeral announcements right away. 
 Shoot. 
 That was lovely, thank you so much. 
 Margaret, Paul, you two get some sleep. 
 ...nun banger. 
 Absolutely. 
 It's OK.  We just wrapped up.  This is my wife, Margaret. 
 Okee dokee, smokee. 
 She's under a little strain right now. 
 I called them. 
 Well, they've been asking me to talk some more about Raymond.  I thought now might be an appropriate time. 
 I had to borrow money for the casket, Mr. Ted. 
 No, I doubt that.  They asked me to bring some photos of Raymond.  Guess it's gonna be a pretty big story. 
 That's your plan? 
 How tough can it be? 
 You ever try digging through six feet of half frozen sod?  We'd need a back hoe.  Can you operate a back hoe?  Do you know where we'd get a back hoe?  We don't even know for sure... 
 Oh please.  Don't you think it's a pretty neat coincidence? 
 Maybe we just go explain it to Dave. 
 He won't take it well. 
 Then I'm all for new options, here, Gary. (beat)  If we give the money back-- 
 Hey, wait a minute, now.  We did the job.  We deserve the-- 
 I did the job, Gary.  I know, because I haven't been sleeping for the last week. 
 I don't know why you're letting it get to you like this. Look, let's just not rush into anything.  It's my turn to step up.  I know that.  I'm on it. 
 Hey little, Bambi.  Where's your Mommy?  Gettin' it from some ten point buck.  Yes she is.  Yes she is. 
 Stay away from our fucking appliances. 
 Lady, just calm down. 
 You are in so much trouble. 
 Lady, so help me I -- 
 So you're a souvenir wholesaler? 
 For the cruise ship trade, mostly.  Usual stuff, stuffed animals, your huskies, your moose, your baby seals, your whales, your walrus -- 
 (looking up/duh!) Yeah.  Through that... big hole in the roof.  I got a list of all the things that are missing. 
 Uh, we figure about 200,000, plus fixing the roof. Now I know you guys are gonna bust my -- 
 (taking Ted aside) Ted.  Maybe we should take a look at their inventory list first? 
 I should tell you... we also had some VCRs we were holding for another company.  That could run another couple of... 
 Mr. Spellman?  Now I noticed a nice looking computer in your office.  Why do you think they left that? 
 You try and rape me, I swear to Christ I'll bite it off. 
 (O.S.) What's going on? 
 (O.S.) Okay, now here's the thing, just keep an open mind. 
 So what now, you gonna get me smokin' from both ends? 
 I just came to look around, but she started yelling and hitting me... 
 Oh please. 
 How the hell is this solving our problem?  How is this stepping up? 
 Just listen, okay. 
 Yeah, listen, if the fat from your neck hasn't stopped up your ears. 
 This is not what we do. 
 It is now. 
 Where would we stash her?  Your place? 
 Too small, plus we'd have to get her in and out without anyone seeing.  And I've seen that sty you call an apartment. 
 See, it's just a bad idea. 
 Yeah.  Maybe. (a possible idea) You see the whirlpool tub? 
 You can't be serious. 
 It could be like a little getaway. 
 Hey Maggie-magster.  How ya -- 
 Mr. Barnell.  You have something that belongs to us. 
 I, I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Do you remember a dead man you found in the dumpster behind your office? 
 No, I can't say that... I mean that would probably stick in my mind a... dead body. 
 Think hard Mr. Barnell. 
 I thought it might be some weirdo sex thing, ya know?  But you look like a pretty straight arrow.  So then I'm thinking, maybe it's a scam.  Maybe somehow our friend is worth some money to you. 
 We, we had a life insurance policy on my brother.  It was for... 100,000 dollars. 
 You know, it's always you quiet guys.  Here's how it's going to work.  We stay here with your wife, you go get our guy. 
 Here? 
 We even see you or a cop even roll past, she's dead. Plus you'll have to explain how you scammed the insurance people out of their hard earned money.  We'll call you in three days. Have the body and, let's say 50,000 dollars for our trouble.  Screw with us, we start mailing your wife back to you. 
 He gone? 
 He was scared.  Really scared. 
 You used the feet thing, didn't you? 
 No. 
 Hey, little help here.  I got Pop Tarts. 
 This stops now.  This case is making me and you crazy, especially you. 
 (re: the file) Dead guy's got a record?  Cool. 
 Honey? 
 I think you should read this again. 
 We don't have any money, you know. 
 Lady.  Please. 
 If you want Raymond's fucking insurance money... we don't have that either. 
 It's none of your business what we want. 
 It's a disease.  It's called Tourette Syndrome.  I can't control what I say.  Turnip. 
 Really? 
 You've taken a handicapped person hostage.  I hope you're proud of yourself. 
 I saw this thing on TV where they said people with that don't usually curse. 
 They must have got it wrong. 
 I don't think so.  It was a movie of the week based on real events.  Don't most of Tourette's people twitch and stuff? 
 Over the sink.  And what's that supposed to mean? 
 Nothing.  Cumin? 
 On the left. (beat)  And I'm not... crazy, it's a physical disease.  Sometimes I can control it, and sometimes -- 
 You can't?  Want to know what I think?  I think this "syndrome" is something you read about somewhere and figured, hey, works for me. 
 Ass-rimming ball-sucker. 
 You can completely abdicate your societal responsibilities, say whatever you want whenever you want, and slough it off on a illness.  Maybe I should catch this thing. "Gee, sorry Your Honor, I have a disease that makes me rob 7-11s."  It's called really need a Slurpee disease. 
 You've never robbed a 7-11 in your life you shit eating fuck-weasel.  What kind of man threatens a woman with a gun, anyway? 
 You are so faking it. 
 Oh, I'm faking it?  Is this how you get your kicks, you over-compensating pussy little fart sack? 
 Hey!  Keep your voice down or the gag goes back. 
 You don't scare me.  If something bad was going to happen, my psychic would have told me. 
 MRS. WHERRY Paul, sorry to hear about your brother. (Paul gives a sad smile) You moving in? 
 Just for a bit. 
 MRS. WHERRY She'll come to her senses.  They always do.  Oh, the septic lines are frozen, so you'll have to use the outdoor commode. 
 (to himself) Would it have killed you to clean up before you left, Raymond? 
 Who is it? 
 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) State Police.  Is there a Mr. Barnell here? 
 (as he unlocks it) Yes, is there something wrong-- 
 Hello brother. 
 Raymond?  Is that... 
 Page 16, Paul. That's why I love "USA Today", news from every fuckin' state.  Don't you want to read it?  I was eaten by wild fuckin' animals.  But ya know, despite that, I'm feeling pretty God-damned chipper. 
 Raymond, let me tell you what happened here.  We all thought you were... 
 Dead?  Yeah, I got that impression. 
 But you had dropped off the face of the earth. 
 And you just decide to make it permanent? 
 But there were no records of you anywhere.  I checked. 
 In certain lines of quasi-legal employment, using your actual ID can be a hinderance.  But despite the reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth certificate to fall back on.  Gotta tell ya, Paul, I was pretty pissed. 
 Life insurance. 
 Figured.  So where's my money? 
 Your money? (a beat) They're still... investigating. 
 What you get? 
 Fifty thousand. 
 (with a shrug) Almost worth coming back for.  What's the split?  I get half? 
 (not quite trusting him) Okay.  Sure. (changing the subject) You look good.  Lost some weight? 
 Gave up carbs.  So what are you doing out here? She not go along with it? 
 Who?  Margaret? 
 How she hold up, anyway? 
 She's fine.  Actually, we're not doing so good right now. 
 Any kids? (off his look) Still can't get one by the goalie, huh. 
 Hey. 
 (snarky) Hey. 
 Talked to our friend.  We're okay for now.  How's everything here? 
 Oh, just great. (to Margaret) Seventy six, perfectly normal.  What a shock. 
 He's a little over tired. 
 It's been a rough week. 
 (for Gary's benefit) Really?  Why?  You and your life partner in the shitter having trouble picking a China pattern? 
 (shocked) Um, um... Gary? 
 (O.S.) Your turn to deal with it.  If I come out of this bathroom I'll put a bullet in her head, swear to God. 
 I have a psychiatric disorder. (to Gary, in the bathroom) And so do you! 
 Mr. Watters.  You said on the phone something about a resolution in our claim? 
 My wife and I, we're having some problems. 
 You mean Raymond? 
 I'm not sure I appreciate your tone. 
 I really think you should go now. 
 You know Mr. Watters, I've had a pretty rough night, so if you wouldn't mind just leaving. 
 MRS. WHERRY (O.S.) What's say you just move away from him. 
 I'm fine, Mrs. Wherry.  Just go back inside. 
 MRS. WHERRY I can drop him if you want. 
 I'm fine.  Really. (turning to Watters) I think you'd better go. 
 MRS. WHERRY I've got some fishing line if you want me to stitch that. 
 He give you the check? 
 No.  He thinks I...  It'll be fine. 
 Maybe I'll pay him a little visit.  See if we can speed up the process. 
 You don't have to... I figured out a way to take care of things. 
 Yeah, I was watching from the window. 
 You can't do that, Raymond.  If someone sees you... 
 Ya know, I been thinking there, Paulie. 
 About what? 
 After we get her back from these guys who grabbed her, you think your wife'll be able to keep her mouth shut? 
 I don't think I... 
 Crazy people talk a lot.  And I think if you tell your therapist something, they can use it in court. 
 She's not...  she doesn't have a therapist. 
 (taking a slug) Still, might wanna think about it. 
 Think about what? 
 You crossed over into the bigs now, Paulie.  Fraud. Consorting with felons.  Got to "cowboy up." 
 Cowboy up? 
 Get tough, ya suck-hole.  I'm just saying sometimes a man has to make problematic decisions.  Cull the heard, so to speak. (off his look) Paul, come on, just kiddin' around, here.  Don't be such a fuckin' stick. 
 PAUL (MUFFLED) I haven't called the police yet, but I'll tell you it was certainly tempting. 
 Watters.  Glad you're... Mr. Barnell was just telling me about the... meeting you two had. 
 As you can see... well, Mr. Barnell has some... concerns. 
 Ted, his neighbor says... otherwise. 
 It... did get better. 
 Raymond was always... bothered by it. When he came back from... Florida, he'd had it fixed.  Laser surgery... like removing a tattoo. 
 You taped my brother's body, in the morgue? 
 That will be just about enough of that. Mr. Barnell, I'm sorry it's all come to this.  We'll have a check brought over to you tomorrow morning. 
 Jesus, we're lucky he's not suing.  Now tomorrow, you deliver the check to Mr. Barnell with a complete apology. 
 It looks like you beat the hell out of one of our policy holders.  Now send Cam in here. 
 Well, while you were off on your little Easter Egg hunt, your junior found us an out on that warehouse robbery.  Head office is bumping him a level. 
 They're very keen on him.  They want me to feel him out on a transfer -- 
 Hello... yes, I'm wondering what city department would be in charge of... sure, I can hold. (to himself) Hang on Mag Pie, just hang on. 
 Listen you little prick, we've had just about enough of this.  You get me? 
 Ray - 
 Hey Paul.  Took care of our little problem today.  We should see some serious money any time, soon. 
 Could... I have a word with you? 
 (whisper) Are those...? 
 (serious) Prostitutes? (laughing) I sure as hell hope so, cause Jehovah's Witnesses won't lick your lolly no matter how much you pay them. 
 How did you get them here? 
 Put it on my plastic.  See, got my name on it and everything.  It's every where I want to be. 
 You can't use that.  You're supposed to be dead! They'll track us down. 
 You think they give a shit who pays the bill?  Think for a minute, will ya? 
 What... Raymond, what is... this? 
 That's "muh gun," Paul. 
 Yes, hello.  Sorry, what? 
 You having a party, Mr. Barnell? (embarrassed for Margaret) That's... that's not right. 
 Thirty, sorry, startinnng... Now! 
 There's no party...let me talk to my wife. 
 Hang on. 
 Twenty-five! 
 Why are you counting? 
 Paul?  Are you entertaining? 
 (a wave of relief) Oh God, oh Jesus... Margaret, are you okay? 
 (O.S.) Paul, we got any more chips? 
 Fifteen! (grabs the phone) The body. Have you -- (beat) No, I'm the other guy. Have you got the body? 
 (shouting) Paul, the carrot little weasly one wants to carrot screw me with his sick carrot little cock.  And he's messing up my kitchen.  Carrotcarrocarrot... 
 You sick... Don't you hurt her!! 
 I never said anything like-- (looks at his watch in panic) Yes or no.  Ten seconds. 
 Yes! It'll... it'll happen tomorrow.  Put Margaret back on! 
 (O.S.) Paul!  Chips!! 
 Hello? 
 I think I managed to avoid a trace. 
 (quietly to Gary) We're staying at his house. 
 Hello.  Can I help you? 
 (O.S.) (icily) Mr. Watters? 
 Thank you, I appreciate that. (an awkward pause) Please, sit. 
 No, please.  You don't have to... 
 (picking it up) It was a gift from Raymond.  He bought it for me from Florida.  It's all we have to remember him by. 
 I'm not single. 
 Mr. Watters, I love my wife.  Very much. 
 Avis!  Avis? 
 Oh, that's where you went. 
 They do some very nice in store promotions. 
 So, right here, by the X. 
 There's nothing to be embarrassed about. (a snide glance at Ted) A lot of people find talking to a psychic very therapeutic.  So what's on your mind, Carlos? 
 I have a situation.  My wife...  do you think it's okay to do something kinda bad to someone if you think they're gonna do something really bad to someone else? 
 Sure. 
 What if it's a really bad thing? 
 Well, you probably shouldn't break the law if you can help it.  Are you really sure they're going to do this other thing? 
 I'm... I... I don't know.  He said some things.  He said he was joking, but I... I think he might. 
 Don't think, know.  How close are you to the other someone else, the one you're trying to protect? 
 (crying) I just, I just...  Have you ever felt like that?  Like your own life didn't even matter, as long as... 
 (touched) Listen to me, Carlos.  Your wife is an incredibly lucky woman.  I know, relationships are tough, but you do what you gotta do to keep it together, okay? Remember, love is sacrifice. 
 (sniffling) I guess you're right. 
 Now you get tough.  And remember, this call is for entertainment purposes only.  Call me back and let me know how it goes. 
 (blowing by) She's having sex with them. 
 Who's doing what? 
 Margaret.  You know that Stockholm Syndrome thing? 
 The movie? 
 When you fall in love with your kidnappers. 
 Get the fuck out of here. 
 I went by there.  She was in the bedroom with the big one. (quietly) Not the first time, either. (a flash of panic) With other men, not kidnappers. 
 For real? 
 Her therapist.  And some guy she... hardly knew. 
 Wow.  Sucks to be you. 
 Shut up. 
 I always knew she was a fucking tease. 
 Yeah.  Guess you were right. 
 Well, you want my opinion... (Paul nods) I don't trust her, Paul.  Never did. 
 You think she'd... really mess things up? 
 Only one way to make sure she doesn't. 
 Not sure what you're saying? 
 You remember that pooch Mom had?  Crazy little Jack Russel with the bladder infection? 
 Whole basement stank. 
 Nothing you can do but put the thing out of it's misery.  And yours. 
 You... You sure, Ray? 
 Trust me, Bro'.  Leaky dogs, crazy women.  Two things no man should have to live with. 
 Mr. Barnell?  I didn't expect you back today.  Nice jacket. 
 Well... I am.  And Avis? 
 Yes? 
 You've been with me for five years?  Paul?  Can we make it Paul? 
 Sure.  I just thought it was more professional when people were around to call you Mr. Barnell. 
 (O.S.) Avis.  There haven't been any people in here for months.  No one comes in here, unless they're looking for pornographic movies or deep fried fish, neither of which we carry.  So you can call me pretty much anything you want and it won't impress the customers at all because we don't have any. 
 Are you OK, Paul? 
 No Avis, to be frank I'm a little frazzled right now. Now could you get me some tape, my passport out of the safe and two open-ended tickets to Paraguay. 
 Trouble is the city keeps cutting us back and cutting us back. 
 Excuse me, are you Arnith? 
 How'd you know? 
 Know what? 
 That he didn't want to be buried. 
 He left it in a letter. 
 And you just got it now? 
 Ya know, I don't mean to be rude here, but I'm not sure this is any of your business. 
 That's entirely possible. 
 I, I don't think this is anything to be flippant about. 
 I appreciate that, Sir.  But I'm on a union specified break right now, which means you are talking to me as a private citizen. Now as a private citizen I can pretty much say whatever I want to. If you talk to me in 15 minutes I can assure you, you will be afforded every courtesy as specified in the workers policy guide and recently ratified in our latest collective agreement dated -- 
 Sorry.  I'm just -- 
 Trying to get your brother out of the ground. We couldn't be more pleased.  You've arranged for transportation of the remains? 
 We're gonna take him to go. 
 See, now that's a problem.  We can't release the body into your custody unless you are licensed by the state to convey deceased persons. 
 Good point Bill.  Bill knows exhumation policy.  You can look it up but I'm betting he's right.  You come back with a bonded agent and we'll get right on this. 
 I'll give you five hundred dollars to go get him now. 
 (O.S.) There ya go Mr. Barnell.  Snug as a bug in a rug. Anything else we can get you? 
 So... Miami, huh?  Can you believe that?  One little case and "boom", you're the flavor of the month. 
 Say thanks.  I really owe you.  If you hadn't given me a shot on that-- 
 So we were all kinda wondering... what did happen to your face? 
 Should you be driving? 
 We set? 
 Yeah.  How you feel about the turnout by Summit Hill where the snowmobilers park? 
 Fine. 
 Tastes like a rectal polyp. 
 (to Gary) How would she know. 
 See, I could have had her.  We both know that, but I figured, she was such a... I mean, I don't know why... You know why? 
 (O.S.) No.  You want a refill? 
 Does a duck shit under water? 
 They said it'd be in tomorrow by -- 
 Right, right, you told me.  Then all we have to do is get her and the thing... Hey, remember that time in school, when I jumped out and scared you, and you fucking pee'd all over yourself? 
 Was pretty funny. (raises his mug) Bottoms up. 
 Okay, "Puddles."  Remember how they called you that?  Huh, "Puddles?" (about to drink - then) Christ, what time is it? 
 It's early.  Come on... ya... (uncomfortably) ...pussy. 
 (O.S.) Pussy!!! 
 (O.S.) Gary!  You seen my shirt? 
 (O.S.) It relaxes me.  You know it has twelve different settings? 
 (O.S.) No Gary, I don't know that because every time I thought about using it someone was in it. 
 (O.S.) Hey, I do a lot around here. 
 (half asleep) What's going on. 
 We're out of coffee.  But I'll be right back.  Still early. 
 Paul? 
 (O.S.) The number you have dialed is no longer in service. If you think you have -- 
 Oh thank fucking Christ.  Is Tiffany there? 
 Well you should know, fuck-wit.  You know there's a man with a gun in my shower, right now? 
 I'm here, Margaret.  How you feeling today? 
 (to Ted) What is wrong with you? 
 Christ, where do you want to start? 
 Sorry about that.  Mrs. Barnell?  Could you speak up a bit? 
 Something about the gay mafia taking her to a park to kill her.  Can you hand me my Help Line list? 
 Margaret, are you sure these are real people in your house? 
 (listening to a profane ramble) Well then it's a good thing you called.  Nope, not seeing any problems, but hang on, let me really concentrate. 
 Shit on toast. 
 She specifically mentioned the cock-sucking turnout up the highway where the snowmobilers hang out. 
 I won't be here. 
 I know relationships aren't all sunshine and roses, but I'm really not having fun anymore, and I don't think you are either. 
 Maybe you have to be like this right now, and I'm just not in a good space to deal with it.  But... 
 Maybe we shouldn't be like this together. 
 (to Ted) Really? 
 If you're going to be sarcastic. 
 Okay.  Why do you want me to come? 
 (into the phone) Mr. Bennett, she's totally cool with it.  but listen, you're gonna have to call back... I gotta go help my boyfriend. 
 Okay, it's called the listening game.  You talk, I listen, and I can't interrupt.  Then we switch. 
 Yes. 
 See the little box down there?  Lists all the symptoms of that Tourette's thing, and you don't have half of them. 
 And? 
 And?  And you're faking it. 
 Magazines don't prove anything. 
 Gary, can we just try and get there in peace? 
 Magazines prove everything!! 
 (O.S.) That little prick!!! 
 You can't be serious. 
 I'm still not sleeping. 
 Jimbo.  Come on. 
 It's a thought, okay.  With hard work, you can live okay as a civilian. 
 After all this... 
 Yeah, after all this. 
 Don't you go soft on me, Jimbo. 
 So this is kind of like a really weird "Law and Order" episode? 
 And if Paul Barnell already killed his brother... 
 Cool.  My turn? (Ted nods) Now a healthy relationship is... 
 Calibre? 
 Mr. Barnell.  I'll assume you've got our friend back there? 
 Yes.  You can let her go now. 
 (gently) So, do you have a plan here? 
 I guess.  So when do we call the cops? 
 That's a very good plan. 
 Who? 
 How do we know it's him? 
 Come on!  Where would I get another one? 
 I know you? 
 Go away, now. 
 (stops cold) How much? 
 It's all over honey.  It's all over.  Did they hurt you? 
 (smiling/whisper) Does food poisoning count?  Have you been eating? 
 You know me when I get busy. 
 Did you fall? 
 Just a little. (to Jimbo) Hey, we're gonna get... 
 Who the hell is that? 
 Paul? 
 (quietly) Honey, I need you to start walking to that hill over there, alright? 
 Why? 
 I'll catch up in a bit.  Now, no matter what you hear, just keep going, alright.  And if I'm... late or something, just look in the coat, alright? 
 (nervous) Jimbo? 
 (yelling) A million dollars, Paul!?  You really think you could take me?  Again! 
 What million dollars? 
 Raymond... please. 
 Hey!  What the fuck!! 
 And you do? 
 You first. 
 Gary!  Just -- 
 You win, tough guy. 
 (meek, apologetic) Sorry. 
 Oh God... Oh Jesus... 
 (muffled) Oh fucking hell... I can't... breath. 
 Can you stand. 
 Is... The Pope... a... 
 Okay, easy... 
 (starting to lose it) He just, fell... Oh Jesus, oh God. 
 I know. 
 (laboured) Look at me, you little... 
 Ted, leave him alone. 
 Okay. 
 (a long pause) I love my wife, Mr. Watters.  And when you love someone, I mean, really love someone... 
 They call this the listening game.  Mr. Barnell, you get to go first. 
 Hey. 
 So where you want to go? 
 Cool.  You alright about everything? 
 Good.  I like it when you're okay. 
 (V.O.) Pauly, know it sounds corny but I miss you so much! Wish you could have come.  Saw some dolphins today.  Frisky little buggers.  They were even playing our song in the bar.  Have been pondering about your question, and I think my answer is "yes."  After all, it's no fun in the sun without... 
 How you feeling? 
 Pretty damn good. 
 I can tell. 
 Can you? 
 Why don't we go there after? (off her look) Fine.  We'll do it now. 
 DAVE'S WIFE Watch the curb.

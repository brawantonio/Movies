 (V.O.) The last of the great cities died when my father was a child. Another victim of yet another war. The plagues followed. And the terrors. The living hid themselves away in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained. The Earth itself had fallen prey to chaos. For three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase. The ocean was barren. Poisoned. Near death. 
 (V.O.) Sixteen long years passed before the great lungs started working again. My father said it was as if the ocean breathed a great sigh of relief... 
 MAN'S FOOTPRINTS 
 Portland's under twenty feet of water. 
 You mouthin' me? 
 He is mouthin' you; I say we kill him. 
 Don't be in such a rush, Martin. (back to The Postman) Now I see a pack mule over there, but I don't see no packs. 
 Oh... Kill him, Martin. 
 #20 What do you got in there? 
 Shut up. (to Postman) What do you got in there? 
 #20 Maybe he's got it booby-trapped. 
 You go up and get it. 
 (O.S.) Just you start tossing those cigarettes down! 
 
 #20 Maybe he fell asleep. 
 
 Put some buckshot through it, Martin. Just to hurry him up. 
 I only got three shells left. 
 So use his gun. 
 
 
 
 
 #20 We're rich!

 MRS. THOMPSON The children have never heard Shakespeare before. 
 I'm clapping because you stink. 
 When I was young, I tried to be an actor. I was awful. But now I won't die thinking I was the worst one. 
 MRS. THOMPSON Larry, stop it. (to The Postman) You were very good. 
 Holnists!   Holnists are coming! 
 MRS. THOMPSON It's okay. We give them food and supplies. All the towns do. 
 #1 They hardly kill anyone lately. Just take a woman sometimes. 
 (O.S.) What are you doing there? 
 I said, what are you doing? 
 It's just a game, General Bethlehem. Something they saw in a play. No harm in it. 
 A play? (to kids) Show me. It's all right, children, show me. 
 Arm, arm yourselves! No running from the witches! 
 (surprised) Shakespeare, is it? Well, I'm sorry I missed it. 
 You should know, sir, we haven't nearly stocked the game we thought we would. 
 Really?   But you had time for a play? 
 I'm taking three conscripts from each town. They will have the honor of serving in the Holnist Army until such time as I see fit. (to Mayor) Three men. You suppose you could do that? 
 All men between 15 and 50 and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now. 
 Acceptable. 
 Sir? 
 Acceptable, Captain! 
 You'll need to put some meat on, but I like an impressionable mind. Acceptable. 
 Mongoloid.   Unacceptable. 
 I want pure blood. Someone like... 
 That man. 
 You were required to show yourself. 
 (O.S.) Take the mule. 
 #20 Hi. 
 #20 Well... I mean, we know each other, kind of... 
 #20 (looking around) Wow! 
 #20 We traded them for a woman. 
 #20 They traded me to the Holnists. 
 (O.S.) Ten hut! 
 Welcome, gentlemen, to your new life. You have been born again as soldiers in the army of the United Clans of Holn. The strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak. Men, strong men, have been denied their destiny. You men have been saved from that fate. Redemption is within your grasp. 
 You. What did you do before you were given this opportunity? 
 I had a shovel. I digged holes. 
 You digged holes... Well, now you're going to fill them. (turns to Postman) And you? 
 Is there any question in anyone's mind that I was talking to you? Yes, you. You look like a dangerous man. Are you? 
 Shakespeare? 
 I know who Shakespeare was... 'Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war.' 
 'We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.' 
 You're pretty good. You're also a fighter. I see it in your eyes. 
 Don't you agree? Come on, a man's got to speak his mind. 
 Don't you think I should be the judge of that, soldier? 
 Get up.   I said, get up. 
 Put up your fists. 
 Now fight. 
 You're right. You're not a fighter. But you will be. I'm giving you a chance at a life that means something. A life worth living. 
 (O.S.) Let's move it.     Everybody up and at 'em. 
 Say it again. 
 The words you said in town. About the wind blowing. And the rest... Say it again. 
 What's it mean? 
 All right, girls. We're gonna run. Twenty miles. With packs. You got three hours. Everybody makes it. Or nobody eats. 
 Eat up!    You got meat tonight. 
 Why don't you tell Shakespeare what kind of meat that is. 
 Mule. 
 A godawful animal. The sterile offspring of a horse and a donkey. Can you imagine that?! There's no room in this new world for a bastard like that. 
 Uh uh. (loudly; for all) Any man last in line ain't hungry enough. You show up last, you don't eat! 
 #20 I'll die before I'm last in line again. 
 #20 Serious?   This isn't bad. 
 The laws of eight, gentlemen. That is the legacy handed down to us by Nathan Holn. 
 God rest his soul! 
 These are the laws that we live by. The eight is our symbol. Each man will bear it with pride. 
 Only then will you be part of the clan. Sit down, gentlemen. 
 Law One. You will obey orders without question. (to Slow Recruit) I told you to sit. 
 (scared) There weren't enough chairs. 
 I didn't specify chairs. You could've sat down on the ground. 
 You disobeyed a direct order.    You broke Law One. 
 Law Two.   Punishment shall be swift. 
 Law Three: Mercy is for the weak. Four: Terror will defeat reason. Five: Your allegiance is to the clan. Six: Justice can be dictated. Law Seven. Any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan. Does any man here wish to challenge me? 
 On your feet! 
 Law Eight: There is only one penalty: Death. 
 Please, I'm begging you. 
 You will get out of this army what you put into it. Work and you'll be fed. Fight and you'll be respected. Die and you'll be remembered. It's up to you. 
 You thinking of challenging for leadership of the clan? 
 You see Colonel Getty? Always following the General? He's the only man who ever challenged. Fight lasted six seconds, but the General didn't kill him. He cut off his tongue and he cut off his balls and old Getty's been following him like a dog ever since. 
 The General don't see it, but I say you got some nigger in you. 
 The General would like a word with you, Shakespeare. 
 (re: the book and binoculars on the table) They're yours. A solitary man, aren't you? Binoculars. To watch life from a distance. And Shakespeare. To read about it instead of living it. 
 If he wishes to rise above mere thuggery, a military commandeer must be classically educated. Philosophy, history. Even a sense of the dramatic. (a beat) Do you know what I did before the war? Do you think I was in the army? I sold copying machines. I was a salesman. The talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away inside me. 
 If Nathan Holn hadn't come along, I'd still be selling copying machines. Can you imagine the wasted life? Can you imagine the magnitude of it? But war... War gives men like me a chance. 
 Here... 'The prize is often left unclaimed. Have the courage to grasp it. For fortune always favors the bold.' (moved) It always inspires me. (beat) I have a design for the future. A master plan. I'll need able officers to carry it out. You have the intelligence. If your heart matches, you'll go far. (a beat) We'll talk more in the weeks to come. Dismissed. 
 Issue the binoculars to a scout. 
 And the book, sir? 
 Burn it. 
 Quit moving. 
 #20 What happened? 
 #20 What did he say? 
 #20 Did he say anything about me? 
 #20 What are you talking about? 
 #20 We can't. 
 #20 No, no. I can't. I like it here. I like being a part of something. 
 One of you dogs has earned himself a treat. Over there. 
 Those men hunted themselves a lion this morning. Must've been a zoo around here before the war. Anyhow, they shot him and he crawled into that thicket. A third man went in after him. We don't know if he's dead or alive. I need a volunteer. Someone's gotta go in and get our boy out. 
 #20 I'll go. 
 I guess size ain't a measure of courage, is it? Shakespeare! 
 (O.S.) I don't think so, Captain. 
 Come out alive and you got yourself a lion steak. 
 (winks) Maybe you'll find your St. Rose up there. 
 What are you waiting for, Christmas? 
 (O.S.) Why are you stopping? 
 (O.S.) He alive? 
 (O.S.) Bring him out. 
 
 
 (across river) Hurry up! You still got a lion to bag! 
 In the water. Come back without him and you and another man will die in his place. 
 Go!   Go! 
 #20 (caught up) I'll get him, sir. 
 #20 My army.   I like the sound of that. 
 #20 I got him!   Over -- 
 They sent me to kill you. 
 Good, boy.   Get him. 
 It's you or me. 
 Finish it. 
 No harness on my back. 
 
 You want your St. Rose? 
 
 #1 Just head back the way you came. Pine View ain't buying, ain't listening and don't give charity. 
 #2 What the hell are you talking about? 
 I'm Sheriff Briscoe. Who the hell are you? 
 What does that mean in English? 
 (to someone on wall) Hand me your gun. 
 You got three seconds to get your ass outta here. 
 One! 
 Never heard of him. Two! 
 Three! 
 MRS. MARCH Did he say my name? 
 MRS. MARCH I'm Irene March. 
 MRS. MARCH Would you read it? 
 MRS. MARCH Please.   Someone has to. 
 Just read it, will ya? 
 MRS. MARCH My sister in Denver. Fifteen years ago. Thank you. 
 MRS. MARCH You're a Godsend. A savior. 
 MRS. MARCH Oh, yes, absolutely... Is there anything else? 
 (beaming) Cleaned and pressed, sir. 
 Yeah, I'm supposed to take you to Foster's. (extending a hand) My name's Ford. Ford Lincoln Mercury. 
 Used to be John Stevens, but I changed it on account of I want to drive cars. 
 I live in that car. A 2003 Pontiac Sinatra. With a nine- banger and a Q-eight. 
 (in awe of him) Were they fast? 
 A buck seventy-five on a strip. 
 A buck seventy-five? I thought maybe I could fix some of them up. It's nothing compared to what you do. 
 #1 Tell us about the government! 
 #1 Yes, tell us everything! 
 #2 Is there a President? 
 #2 What's his name? 
 #3 He a Democrat or a Republican? 
 #4 What about Europe? Any word? 
 #3 Is Nathan Holn still alive? 
 #4 And the Holnists? They're still out there. What's the government going to do about them? 
 #5 What about the Marines Corp? 
 Be quiet, everyone! Can't we just let this man eat? 
 That's not a toy, honey. That's very important. Give it back. 
 Would you like to dance? 
 All you got to do is hold on. 
 
 How tall are you? 
 Are you smart? 
 Just wondering. Did you ever have the bad mumps? 
 Have you ever had herpes or syphilis or anything like that? 
 So as far as you know, you have good semen? 
 I don't mean to be nosy. I'm only asking because I want you to make me pregnant. 
 This is my husband.    Michael. 
 We've been trying to have a baby for three years. We can't on account of Michael had the bad mumps when he was twelve. So we need a body father. We could ask a man here, but it could cause trouble. I've seen it happen. Things go okay until the woman starts to show. Then it can be bad. But you'll only be around once in awhile with the mail. 
 He hasn't said 'no'. 
 (undaunted) What do you say, mister?     You'd be doing us a favor. 
 #1 Mrs. March wants to give you something. (to Mrs. March) He's right here, Irene. 
 MRS. MARCH (re: letter) It's to my daughter Annie. She left five years ago. She was only fifteen. The last I heard, she was living up north... 
 MRS. MARCH Know what? 
 MRS. MARCH I have a feeling about you. I know you'll do what's right. 
 (O.S.) It's right around the corner. 
 What you're looking for. 
 I knew you'd come here. 
 How do you get to be a postman, anyhow? 
 How could I do it? 
 Not anymore. That was kid's stuff. This is real. So, where's the right place? 
 Kinda like vampires, right? 
 What does? 
 I'll set them straight. 
 I've been lonely all my life. 
 POSTMAN/FORD (repeating) Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds. 
 (repeating) Okay, then. 
 I want you to know I'd die to get a letter through. 
 (O.S.) Johnny, why don't you run along. I need to speak to this man. 
 I'll see you around. 
 Johnny's real impressed with you. Whole town's real impressed with you. 
 Smarter than you look. 
 You can clear out. Or I can throw you out. Either way suits me fine. 
 You're not authorized by shit. You're nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail. And I want you out of my town. 
 These people don't need dreams, Mr. Postman. They need something real. They need help with the goddamn Holnists. Are you going to bring them that? (as The Postman doesn't answer) Didn't think so. All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts. I aim to keep it that way. You can stay till morning. Then I don't ever want to see you again. 
 
 PACKAGE - NIGHT 
 You'll be leaving tomorrow? 
 (enters; closes door) Everybody's up late writing letters for you to take. We're not supposed to waste candles like that, but they're so excited. 
 I don't have anybody to write to. 
 You're funny. Hardly anyone's funny around here. 
 Have you decided yet? 
 I don't want to. 
 It would be easier for me if you closed your eyes. 
 These are going to Blue Jay. About twenty miles east. I thought I could take them. 
 I'm your escort out of town. 
 #1 We took a vote, Mr. Postman.   We want you to have this horse. 
 #2 Now don't say no. A man on horseback can cover ten times the territory of a man on foot. 
 #3 There's a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations. 
 #1 Where do you figure you'll go from here? 
 ELLEN & TOWN 'Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain. For purple mountain's majesty, above the fruited plain. America...' 
 You got a helluva nerve, whoever you are. 
 She and Michael are working the north meadow this morning. 
 Well, you're on your own. 
 Hey! Are you really who you say you are? 
 God damn it! 
 What are you looking at? 
 Everything. 
 Holnists!    Holnists are coming! 
 They don't usually look at me. 
 Who's responsible for that?! 
 Holnists, Johnny. You gotta stay out of sight. 
 I'm a postman. And I'm not hiding from anyone. I -- 
 You stay out of this, or I'll lock you up myself damnit. 
 You.  You'll be responsible. (to soldiers) Get him a torch. 
 Set that flag on fire. 
 
 Now throw it through the window of your 'post office.' 
 
 
 The United States doesn't exist. That flag is an abomination. 
 General Bethlehem. (as Bethlehem turns) We're gathering the tribute, sir. Can I take your wagons? 
 Make sure that fire doesn't go out. 
 Good Lord. That, gentlemen, is a first-rate piece of ass. 
 Tell the Sheriff I want to be introduced. She does not belong in a mudhole like this. 
 Excuse me. 
 (looks over) You again? 
 That's my wife, General.   She's a married woman. 
 Do you know what system of government we have here, son? (as Michael shrugs) A feudal system. Like the Middle Ages. With lords and vassals. That's you and me. Those lords, they had some ideas. If a vassal got married, it was the lord's right, his right, to sleep with the bride on the wedding night. 
 Me and Abby have been married for three years. 
 Sorry, but I wasn't invited to the wedding. Now, you've already done me one favor, son. Don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record. 
 
 
 We'll be civilized about this. I want you to give me your blessing. 
 Sir, I can't.     You can't. 
 Can't? I'm tired of can't. We had a great nation once. Do you know what made it that way? I can! Till the weak came along. The 'I can'ts' destroyed us. But I'm going to make us strong again. I'm going to be the father of a new nation. (draws his sword) Do you know why it will be me? 
 Because I can! 
 Michael! 
 You didn't have to -- 
 Didn't have to what, Sheriff? 
 Your people seem seditious.    You seem seditious. 
 Aw, Michael... 
 What am I seeing here? I'm waiting. 
 (burying his anger) Man came through here. With mail. Said he was a postman. Said the government had been restored back east. 
 What government? 
 The United States government. 
 Who said that? 
 Which way did he go? (a beat) Do not make me ask again. 
 (lies) East. 
 (to Getty) Send a patrol east. Send three more south, north and west. (to Briscoe) They'd better find him east. 
 I managed to save these. 
 (re: shirt) Take that thing off, Johnny.    You want to die, too? 
 I'm headed south. With the mail. 
 (grabs harness) Don't be a damn fool. 
 What kind should I be?... Haw! 
 G.D. died last winter of flu. 
 Tell us about President Starkey! 
 What about New York City?   Did they survive the plague? 
 #3 How much is it to mail a letter? 
 #3 That sounds awful cheap. 
 (rides up; salutes) They won't open the gates, sir. 
 What? 
 They say they got a representative of the restored United States in there. They say this army is illegal. They say -- 
 Drop dead and go to hell! 
 The Romans had an expression they used to scare their children. 'Hannibal ad portas!' -- Hannibal is at the gates. Do you know who Hannibal was? (as she doesn't answer) Of course not. A pretty girl like you wouldn't know a thing. (to Getty) Colonel Getty, get some men up there and open that gate. 
 What the hell are you doing?! Open the gates! 
 Government's restored! We don't have to take their crap anymore! 
 Idiots! 
 #1 (realizing; scared) They're gonna kill us all. 
 No!   Let's fight them! 
 With what? We got five guns maybe 20 rounds of ammo in the whole town! How do we fight them with that?! 
 Okay. You're a government rep. You go tell them. 
 Make it quick.     I've got an attack to coordinate. 
 Do I know you? 
 (scans uniform) You're the Postman, aren't you? 
 
 The restored United States. Do these people really believe that shit? Who are you really? 
 I was at the Battle of Georgetown. I watched the White House burn to the ground. Don't try to sell me on any restored U.S... 
 You're funny.    Now, what are the terms? 
 Appreciate your offer, Postman. Problem is, you're in no position to negotiate. These people made it through the bugs and the riots and the three year winter. But they're not going to survive you. 
 Law six, justice can be dictated. (to soldiers) Kill him. And kill the restored United States with him. 
 (by rote) In accordance with law eight and by the authority of Emergency Order 46, you are hereby -- 
 Get her. 
 Colonel Getty! 
 We can't stop now. They'll be coming after us. 
 Don't move. 
 If you'd had a bullet, you'd a used it by now. 
 You're right. 
 They killed Michael. 
 How sorry are you? 
 You got the mark of eight on you. 
 You're a liar.     I should've let you die. 
 Anything else? 
 Your legs are going to rot off if you don't try to walk. 
 You're lazy. 
 This is the last of it. 
 I'm going to check the pass. 
 Help! 
 I told you that's all there was. 
 I knew you could walk. 
 So?    What good is that now? 
 Look, there's something you'd better know. You're going to find out soon enough. I'm pregnant. (a long beat) It's Michael's baby. You're just the body father. 
 He tried with me almost every night. He couldn't do it. So he beat me. Said it was my fault. 
 
 The pass is clear. It's time to go. 
 Of course. 
 I set the fire. 
 You didn't think we'd stay here forever, did you? (The Postman has no response) I'd appreciate if you'd walk with me long enough to find someplace safe for the baby. Then we can split up. (a beat) You shaved. 
 It looks nice. 
 I've heard people talk. I've heard lots of names. Bliss. Hesperia. New Eden. Sheriff Briscoe says it's a fantasy. 
 But you're The Postman. 
 Me neither, mister. 
 What are you? 
 PONYTAIL (RIDER) Carrier 18. U.S. Postal Service. Got any mail? 
 Ain't you heard of The Postman? 
 No, tell us. 
 He's only the greatest man who ever lived. He crossed the wasteland, shook his fist at the enemy and spit in the eye of General Bethlehem himself. He's back east with President Starkey right now. 
 Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury. He's in direct contact with the restored congress. 
 (growing irritated) Do you have mail, or don't you? 
 Thirty-two.    As of midnight. 
 You got another letter? 
 More recruits? 
 Did you get a letter or didn't you? 
 Gather 'round, everybody. Got another letter here. Came in last night. 
 Postman sent Ford another letter. He's gonna read it. 
 (reading) 'Hello, all postal carriers.' 
 (a ritual) Hello! 
 I'm here in Minneapolis with President Starkey, but my thoughts are with you. Remember, nothing worth doing can be done overnight. Keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot. Signed, The Postman. 
 His letters are always kind of short. 
 (looks up) Hold on now. There's a P.S... Anybody know what P.S. stands for? 
 Holy shit... 
 I seen him once when I lived in Benning. It's The Postman! 
 Guess you want to talk about this? 
 I found him!   I found him! 
 I thought you were dead. 
 I lied. I told people you were in contact with me. 
 Because I didn't want it to end. 
 Sure. But you'll stay till he sends word? Right? 
 You'll stay 'til President Starkey sends word, right? Right? 
 Could you say a few words? 
 We bring all the mail here first. We sort it, group it and then it goes out. So far we got thirty routes. 
 (low, to Red) Boy, he's smart. 
 PONYTAIL/RECRUITS Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night... 
 Seventy-five, sir. 
 Nope. Can't walk too good, either. 
 I know stuff. 
 1970. A girl with eyes as big as saucers did me in a little town called Saigon. 
 Yes? 
 I'm on the other side of town. 
 What do you think, Lieutenant? 
 Can't tell what it is if you stand too close. The colors all kinda run together, don't they? 
 Yes... 
 Well, if it isn't our old friend the U.P.S. man. 
 We captured him on the Oregon border. 
 Who the hell are you? 
 CARRIER (PRISONER) Carrier Twelve. United States, um, Postal Service. 
 I want the camp struck at dawn. We're moving north. 
 Yes, sir. 
 (chilling) You spelled tyranny wrong. 
 Boy, he's smart. 
 We never named it. 
 I missed him. 
 Phil, this better not be another of your U.F.O.'s. 
 (amazed) I'll be damned. 
 Bethlehem is offering a 1000 pounds of gold to whoever brings you in. Dead or alive. 
 I'd have shot you myself. 
 Things are getting better. Getting better all the time. (a beat) I don't know who you are, but I do know I was wrong about you. 
 It's from my sister. I thought she was dead. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Births and deaths, the weather, gossip. There's nothing here. 
 Nothing? Everything is here.    Am I the only one who sees that? (to Gibbs) Get out! 
 Give the people back their hope and their dreams won't be far behind. 
 What is it, Getty? 
 (crumpling the paper) A military man, especially a commander, should keep a journal. After he's gone, it's the only real defense against the slander that arises. 
 Not a soul in seven years of trying. But I will. 
 Go ahead. Take a look. (offering joint) Want some? 
 I was an aerospace engineer. I helped design the Galileo space station. (scanning sky) I dream it's orbiting Earth forever. With a dozen human skeletons all grinning at each other. Laughing at us down here. 
 It's Red.   He's overdue. 
 No.  No. Not him. No. (looks to soldiers) Children. I want a man and you bring me children! 
 Not yet. General wants the message to get back. 
. 
 Halt!   Identify yourself! 
 
 
 
 (reading) Postage due... 
 You want a war? I'll give you a war. I was born for it! 
 FORD/RECRUITS Neither snow, nor heat, nor gloom of night. Through bandit's hell, through fire fight. Through flood and plague we cannot fail. No Holnist trash will stop the mail. 
 Ford's idea. 
 Sir? It'd be an honor if I could shake your hand. 
 Sir? 
 No, sir. 
 (ignores it) You're exhausted. You need rest. There's food in the trailer -- 
 Route twenty-two. I'm already an hour late. 
 What rule? 
 But they're waiting on their mail down there. 
 You can't keep doing this. 
 Riding all the routes.   You're not saving anyone. 
 
 Ready! 
 The post office, General? 
 No. Let it stand. All by itself. So it can remind them what it cost them. 
 Aim! 
 Fire! 
 You think you can ride? (as the Carrier nods) Then today's your lucky day. 
 Bethlehem says... 
 ... he's... headed north. He's gonna kill ten people in every town. Then burn it to the ground. For what you did... 
 He said to tell you Pine View's on his way. He said he'd wait there, but not for long. (breaking down) I was so scared, sir... I thought they were going to kill me, too... I wish they would have... 
 POSTMAN'S POV 
 What are you going to do? 
 You can't. 
 (shaking his head) They'll kill you. 
 You can't help them! 
 (re: The Postman) You're hurting him. 
 No, this is all my doing.    I went against your orders. 
 The Holnists we killed. You told me to bury them. But I didn't. I sent Bethlehem the bodies. 
 Because Bethlehem has to know that we're not going to stop. 
 Bullshit. They're dying because of Bethlehem. They're dying because this is a shitty world. And if we're ever going to change it, then somebody might have to die. If I could make it be me down there I would. But I can't. 
 (holding back the tears) We know their names. The little one's my brother. His name is Billy. 
 What Ford did was wrong. But it doesn't change anything for any of us. Does it? 
 (to Getty) He's out there somewhere. Watching. I can feel it. 
 You feel it too, don't you? Didn't have to end like this, Sheriff. He knew where I'd be if he wanted to face me like a man. Instead, he's hiding like a rabbit. So much for your Postman. 
 Ready!    Aim! 
 Ride, Postman! Ride! You hear me? I said ride! 
 Fire! 
 Ford thinks you're going to do something. 
 Ford doesn't know what it means to be a kid. He doesn't have your memories. None of them do. All they've got is the lousy world we gave them. And this is the only decent thing in it. 
 I knew it was something like that. 
 I remember... 
 The rest are on the overdue list. 
 Greetings, President Starkey! 
 (low; fierce) The President never wrote that letter. 
 Who's the other letter to? 
 What does it say? 
 What does it say? 
 It says you quit. What about the oath? 
 Then I'll take it. 
 If this is the end. If this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered. I'll take it. 
 I'm still a postman. You owe it to me... I owe it to me. 
 General Bethlehem said... (raises the pistol) ... You should be on your knees when I do it. 
 The general is a great man. 
 (O.S.) Yes. 
 Guess Minneapolis is that way. 
 Good lord, what do we have here? 
 I'm a representative of the restored United States -- 
 He's got a letter. Says The Postman sent it. 
 A letter? 
 'Bethlehem. This letter is my testimony to the fact that there is no restored United States and there is no Postal Service.' (laugh; grim) Then who the hell have we been fighting...? (reads on) 'My carriers are returning home. In exchange, I'm asking you to let them be. The Postman.' 
 He expects me to believe this? 
 (O.S.) It's true, sir. I was there. He disbanded the carriers and rode west. 
 Traitor... 
 Then I've won.     I've won. 
 You were supposed to kill him. 
 I couldn't get close enough. (re: Ford) This one's his second in command. 
 Why doesn't that surprise me? 
 Bring out the one we found yesterday. They can die together. 
 Who are you? 
 Name's Clark. Postal Carrier of the restored Republic of California. Who are you? 
 Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury. 
 It's an honor. 
 Wait a minute... wait a minute! 
 Sir? 
 Hold your fire! You don't know each other? (to himself, quiet anger building) This will never be over. It'll go on except I'll be fighting a goddamn ghost. 
 Should we fire, sir? 
 No goddamnit. 
 No, I won't fight a ghost. Tabula rasa, gentlemen. A clean slate. I want all mail carriers hunted down. I want The Postman found. I want him dealt with. (to Getty) Colonel, organize the scouts. (to Luke) He rode west? 
 (shakes her head) Where do you think he came from? 
 Howdy. Welcome to sunny California. 
 Little accident. The ground started to shake big time and the Hanford nuclear plant went... (motions an explosion) ... 'Poof.' Destroyed everything for miles. But the sunsets are beautiful. 
 Friend, I've never heard of St. Shit. 
 Hey, don't go! I got Monopoly in the house! Boardwalk, Park Place and the Reading Railroad! 
 You think that's President Starkey? 
 No. 
 What makes you so sure? 
 President lives in a white house. That guy's place is gray. 
 (shaking her head) I'm hungry, Postman. 
 Set the rifle on the ground. 
 B.C. You're in Bridge City. Where we don't allow guns. 
 B.C. Sentry said you were coming. 
 B.C. I was once. Not anymore. (beat) Are you looking to cross? 
 B.C. How many? 
 Boy, is he smart... 
 B.C. For you and your wife. 
 B.C. St. Rose? 
 B.C. Never been. But they say it's a ways down on the coast. 
 B.C. Couple hundred miles at least.   I couldn't say for sure. 
 B.C. We try to be. 
 B.C. (intuitive) You want to leave her? 
 B.C. Why don't you take the night to think. Decide if that's what you really want. 
 
 B.C. They're looking for The Postman. 
 B.C. No such thing anymore. 
 B.C. Man on the horse says there is. Says he thinks he's here. Says he's coming back with friends. 
 B.C. What's a postman? 
 (stepping forward) You never heard of a postman? 
 There used to be a postman for every street in America. They wore uniforms. And hats. Like this one... 
 B.C. Wow... 
 My postman knew the name of every kid on my street. He knew our birthdays. He'd even find the baseballs you'd hit down the street. I can still see the smile on his face. The tip of his cap -- when he had a letter in his bag with my name on it. Mine always came just after school. You could set your watch by him. Unless you were waiting on something special -- like a present from somewhere far away or a letter from your sweetheart. Then it seemed like he'd never come. I used to think they could make time stand still. 
 I don't think we ever really understood what they meant to us until they were gone. Getting a letter made you feel like you were part of something bigger than yourself. No place was ever too far away for the postman. So nobody ever had to be alone. The postman was someone you could count on. Things just made more sense when they were around. (beat) That's the kind of world we used to have. A world a lot of us took for granted. And now we've got this one. And it makes me wonder -- what kind of world do I want my child to live in? I want my child to live in a world where hopes and dreams aren't just lies you tell yourself to get through another day. I want my child, and I want my friends -- I want all of us to live in a world where you still get your mail. 
 B.C. (to The Postman) Are you The Postman? 
 B.C. I've heard of you, man. You're famous. 
 B.C. Fact that we don't allow 'em doesn't mean we don't have 'em. We're not stupid, after all. 
 B.C. No need to be sorry. Long as we get our mail on time. 
 (O.S.) Ready for duty, sir. 
 Talk to the people. Gather who's willing. Tell them it's important. Tell them we can make a difference. 
 And tell 'em we're going to kick ass. 
 This is hard for me. (beat) Michael was the best man I ever knew. I never thought there'd be another man I could love the way I loved him. (searching for the words) I don't know why I've been so blessed. And I've tried to find a way to be thankful, but I swear, if I lose you... 
 I don't know, but I believe in you. You have a gift, Postman.     I saw it back in Pine View. (MORE) 
 ABBY (CONT'D) You made Mrs. March feel like she could see again. You made Ford feel like he was part of the world. You give out hope like it was candy in your pocket. 
 When you come back, we'll be waiting here for you. So you can take us to St. Rose. 
 B.C. There's three good-sized towns up that way. Enough folks to be a big help to you. If you can convince them to come. 
 B.C. A lot higher than it looks, huh? 
 B.C. Don't tell anybody, but I like to ride the damn thing just for the hell of it. Being a city official has its perks. 
 B.C. Trust me, man. This'll get you there a lot faster. 
 B.C. Don't worry about it. Good luck and Godspeed. 
 
 
 Steady, boys, steady. 
 In accordance with Law Eight... 
 Get on with it, you floppy-eared sonuvabitch! 
 (O.S.) ... We were outnumbered, sir. 
 How many? 
 A least a hundred. With guns. 
 (feigning shock) With guns? Are you sure? 
 Yes, sir... 
 Looks more like two hundred to me... 
 (donning a pair of leather gloves) Only thing worse than a coward is one who can't count. Lieutenant, do yourself a favor. Die well in this battle. In my army a deserter's life is a brief and unpleasant one. 
 (to himself) At last, someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me. 
 Reckoning, gentlemen. This is the day I've dreamed of. 
 They're an eager-looking bunch. Morale's a dangerous thing. (to Getty) Bring him up. I want this postman to see how the game is played. 
 Are they surrendering? 
 God, I hope not. 
 My little shipping clerk. 
 Great men are made by other great men. Patton had Rommel. Grant had Lee. But I get you. 
 Are you trying to goad me into a fight? 
 Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. 
 What? 
 You're not a Holnist. You're not a member of the clan. You don't have the right. 
 Where do I know you from? 
 Shakespeare. The one who didn't want to fight. 
 Law seven it is. (to all) This war is settled here! 
 I study people. I know your problem. Do you know why you can't fight? 
 You have nothing to fight for. You don't care about anything. You don't value anything. You don't believe in anything. That's what makes me better. 
 Law three.   Mercy is for the weak. 
 Law eight. There is only one penalty and that penalty is death. 
 Everyone has to learn how to read. 
 #1 Three.    Liberty and justice for all! 
 Four.    No more tattoos. 
 #2 Law five.   Give peace a chance! 
 #2 Law six. Mercy is, it's okay sometimes! 
 #3 Seven!    Bring back vacations! 
 Law eight... 
 ... Live and let live. 
 Would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting. Oh, had I but followed the arts... 
 Huh? 
 Your daddy wrote to tell you that he'll be here as soon as he can. And that he loves you very much. 
 Your daughter.     Her name is Hope. 
 (V.O.) And so my father returned home after the Holnists were defeated... 
 But he never did see St. Rose. There was too much to be done. He'd made a promise and in keeping it -- he traded one dream for another. With no regrets. And so, in honor of my father...

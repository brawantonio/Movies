 
 Professor Pentcho? 
 VOICE (ARLETTE) Multi-tasking again? 
 We can start the descent now. 
 Two hundred feet below us is the world's largest particle accelerator... 
 Did you get that data off to Braverman at Cal Tech? 
 Done. 
 GUIDE (OC) ...at the moment of impact the electrons inside the pipe are travelling six hundred sixty six million miles per -- 
 We need to progress. 
 Hey, it is 3-P-O!  P, P, P!  Professore Paulo Pentcho! 
 That's not an official nickname, Jacque. 
 Beh!  Eets just tun-nel humor. 
 Did they recalibrate the 3k turn? 
 PENTCHO (CONT'D) Give me more angle-control on the bounce. 
 Benissimo, Professore. 
 Fifteen seconds Arlette... 
 
 
 PENTCHO'S VOICE Ten, nine, eight... 
 Then goodbye... 
 WHAT DO YOU WANT? 
!" 
 JACQUE'S VOICE Impact! 
 WANT, PAUL?" 
 What the hell were you thinking?  What?  I want to know!  WHAT?!! 
 Probability of this happening, same make, model, color and year is less likely than the proof for the existence of God. 
 SINGER'S VOICE I know this world is kil...ling you... 
 Paul...? 
 Then goodbye... 
 Less likely than the existence of God. 
 PENTCHO (CONT'D) I've been dreaming about you. 
 Day or night? 
 Both. 
 Is that your... 
 No. (beat) Not yet. 
 Could we go somewhere? 
 I'm heading out of town. 
 (deep breath) Okay. 
 What? 
 I could go out of town. 
 Could you? 
 (nodding) Where to? 
 A place you've never been. 
 That's the physicist's playground. 
 Why am I doing this? 
 It's an experiment. 
 We flopped the first time out. 
 At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways. 
 And you think this is relevant to our relationship? 
 Could be. 
 (wryly) What universe are you in, Paul? 
 A quantum one. 
 The shorthand is, when you send electrons through space, it's impossible to say precisely what they are: particles or waves. 
 PENTCHO (CONT'D) They come into being as one or the other at the moment we observe them. 
 PENTCHO (CONT'D) Nothing is real until it's perceived. 
 The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium. 
 How? 
 Baby, reality is what you choose to make it. 
 God. 
 But only if you live your life that way.  If you experience every moment as discovery. 
 Mia!  You're restoring heaven with dabs of paint.  You're bringing new order to the universe. 
 I always said we were in the same business... 
 If you're right, we have a chance. (beat) To be together. 
! 
 VOICE (OC) I'm not done. 
 When I was a kid I used to snap my head back like a gunfighter on the draw, hoping to catch a glimpse behind me. 
 Of what? 
 God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia. 
 PENTCHO (CONT'D) The universe is snapping my head back.  I'm losing my focus. 
 Welcome, Paul.  Welcome. 
 MIA (CONT'D) "Things fall apart; the center will not hold.  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world." 
 An electron spoke to me yesterday.  (beat) I swear. 
 What did it want? 
 That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment. 
 Like now? 
 Yes. 
 PENTCHO (CONT'D) Did you know electrons have lovers? 
 No.  I didn't.  (dryly) I'm listening. 
 Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier... 
 PENTCHO (CONT'D) A strip of silicon, which for you and me would be like... 
 She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area -- 
 (plowing ahead) A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so -- 
 Dysfunctional -- 
 That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together -- 
 And glow happily ever after. 
 MIA (CONT'D) Don't science me Paul.  (beat) What do you want? 
 VOICE (OC) Paul?  Pauly? 
 Rented every last ve-hicle.  'Cept one. 
 I'll take it. 
 Paul... Pauly... 
 I... I thought you were dead. 
 I must be. 
 Look at me. 
 ALEXANDER (CONT'D) (contemptuous) "Alexander the Great." 
 ALEXANDER (CONT'D) 22 I built the first machine to transfer digital bits over a land line.  I wrote the TCP/IP protocol before thirty.  This mind (tapping his temples), the one and only, was OBGYN at the birth of the Internet.  And where has it taken me? 
 ALEXANDER (CONT'D) To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son. 
 You taking any medication? 
 Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me (pulling the gun out) to this particular switching station? 
 Dad... 
 Two: what if I didn't miss? 
 You did. 
 Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss? 
 You did miss -- 
 -- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?  (softer) What did your life mean? (beat) Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love? 
 ALEXANDER (CONT'D) What was her name? 
 Excuse me??? 
 What was her name?  The one I met. 
 Mia...? 
 Yes.... 
 ALEXANDER (CONT'D) The restorer... 
 I need some air. (beat) Don't shoot me. 
 
 We've been kidding ourselves, Pauly.  Until you look for it, it doesn't even exist. 
 You would have a son with me... 
 PENTCHO'S VOICE "If you could look back fast enough, at near to the speed of light, then there would be no reality behind you, because it hadn't yet been created -- 
 Uncle, hey... 
 Can you feel it, uncle?  Can you feel it right down to your bones?! 
 Yes.  (beat) Yes I can. 
 WOMAN'S VOICE What do you want?! 
 Guess who's coming to dinner. 
 I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time. 
 Wait.  I want to tell you something. 
 I've been dreaming about this. 
 (excited) Then you get it.  You'll understand. 
 What? 
 I know what I want.  I let go, and a second later you materialized at the door.  You see? 
 PENTCHO (CONT'D) Mia.  I can create reality.  (beat) I can choose to love you with all my heart. 
 You know those people who won't be photographed because they're afraid you're stealing their souls...? (long beat) I came to take back my picture.  The one I keep leaving with you. 
 Why? 
 So I can move on.  You too. 
 MIA (CONT'D) Be who you are, Paul.  I love who you are. I do. 
 MIA'S VOICE I'll drive. 
 Do you want to think about it some more? 
 PENTCHO'S VOICE What do you want? 
 Impact!

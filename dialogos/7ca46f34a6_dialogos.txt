 (O.S.) Oh god...oh god...oh god... 
 (O.S.) Oh god...that's sooo good...you're the best...the best I ever had... 
 
 It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a divorce in Reno. 
 I told her I would not grant one. 
 If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset. 
 She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr. Quentin. 
 I went to a few bars first. Later, I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's home and confront them. They weren't there...so I parked my car in the turnout...and waited. 
 I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think mostly I wanted to scare them. 
 Yes. I did. 
 No. I was sobering up. I realized she wasn't worth it. I decided to let her have her quickie divorce. 
 I did not. I got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off. Along the way, I stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River. I feel I've been very clear on this point. 
 (softly) Yes. It does. 
 Yes. It does. 
 Strike me as a fantastic coincidence. 
 It's the truth. 
 (faint, bitter smile) Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found. 
 (O.S.) Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty... 
 You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you. By the power vested in me by the State of Maine, I hereby order you to serve two life sentences, back to back, one for each of your victims. So be it. 
 #1 Sit. 
 #2 We see by your file you've served twenty years of a life sentence. 
 #3 You feel you've been rehabilitated? 
 Fresh fish! Fresh fish today! 
 All clear! 
 On your feet before I fuck you up so bad you never walk again. 
 Never seen such a sorry-lookin' heap of maggot shit in my life. 
 Comin' from you, Heywood, you being so pretty and all... 
 Takin' bets today, Red? 
 Smokes. Put me down for two. 
 That gangly sack of shit, third from the front. He'll be the first. 
 Bullshit. I'll take that action. 
 Me too. 
 You're out some smokes, son. Take my word. 
 You're so smart, you call it. 
 I say that chubby fat-ass...let's see...fifth from the front. Put me down for a quarter deck. 
 What say, Red? 
 Rich bet. 
 Eyes front. 
 This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. You are sinners and scum, that's why they sent you to me. Rule number one: no blaspheming. I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions? 
 When do we eat? 
 YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU SHIT WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT- 
! 
 Any other questions? (there are none) I believe in two things. Discipline and the Bible. Here, you'll receive both. (holds up a Bible) Put your faith in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank. 
 Off with them clothes! And I didn't say take all day doing it, did I? 
 First man into the shower! 
 Delouse that piece of shit! Next man in! 
 Bend over. 
 (O.S.) ...maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul... 
 That's lights out! Good night, ladies. 
 (O.S.) Fishee fishee fisheeee...You're gonna like it here, new fish. A whooole lot...Make you wish your daddies never dicked your mommies...You takin' this down, new fish? Gonna be a quiz later. (somebody LAUGHS) Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws'll hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee... 
 (O.S.) Fat-Ass...oh, Faaaat-Ass. Talk to me, boy. I know you're in there. I can hear you breathin'. Now don't you listen to these nitwits, hear? 
 (O.S.) This ain't such a bad place. I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home. I know some big ol' bull queers who'd love to make your acquaintance...especially that big white mushy butt of yours... 
 FAT-ASS OH GOD! I DON'T BELONG HERE! I WANNA GO HOME! 
 AND IT'S FAT-ASS BY A NOSE.' 
 Fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh fish... 
 FAT-ASS I WANNA GO HOME! I WANT MY MOTHER.' 
 (O.S.) I had your mother! She wasn't that great! 
 What the Christ is this happy shit? 
 (O.S.) He took the Lord's name in vain! I'm tellin' the warden! 
 (to the unseen wit) You'll be tellin' him with my baton up your ass! 
 What's your malfunction you fat fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk? 
 FAT-ASS PLEASE! THIS AIN'T RIGHT! I AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! NOT ME! 
 I ain't gonna count to three! Not even to one! Now shut the fuck up 'fore I sing you a lullabye! 
 Get this tub of shit down to the infirmary. (peers around) If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here the rest of the night, by God and Sonny Jesus, you'll all visit the infirmary. Every last motherfucker here. 
 You gonna eat that? 
 Hadn't planned on it. 
 You mind? 
 Mmm. Nice and ripe. 
 Jake says thanks. Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop. I'm lookin' after him till he's old enough to fly. 
 Oh, Christ, here he comes. 
 Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. You know why it's fine? 
 That's right, send 'em all down. I wanna see 'em lined up in a row, pretty as a chorus line. 
 Smell my ass... 
 Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your horse comin' in last and all. Hell, I sure do love that horse of mine. I believe I owe that boy a big sloppy kiss when I see him. 
 Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty this week? How's that winnin' horse of mine, anyway? 
 Dead. (the men fall silent) Hadley busted his head pretty good. Doc already went home for the night. Poor bastard lay there till this morning. By then... 
 What was his name? 
 What? What'd you say? 
 I was wondering if anyone knew his name. 
 What the fuck you care, new fish? (resumes eating) Doesn't matter what his fuckin' name was. He's dead. 
 
 Hard to get. I like that. 
 (offers his hand) Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne. 
 How do you know that? 
 I didn't, since you ask. 
 Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! 
 What else have you heard? 
 What do you think? 
 I understand you're a man who knows how to get things. 
 I wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer? 
 You make your customers' motives a part of your business? 
 Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks. 
 Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill. 
 I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be again, on a limited scale. 
 I have no enemies here. 
 Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual? 
 Thanks for the advice. 
 If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good. 
 
 Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop. 
 Ten it is. 
 Oh? 
 I understand. Thank you, Mr...? 
 Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you. 
 Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel. 
 DUFRESNE! WE'RE LOW ON HEXLITE! HEAD ON BACK AND FETCH US UP SOME! 
 You get this in your eyes, it blinds you. 
 Honey, hush. 
 That's it, fight. Better that way. 
 ...the roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing. I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work. We're gonna be taking names in this steel bucket here... 
 ...so this shithead lawyer calls long distance from Texas, and he says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He says, sorry to inform you, but your brother just died. 
 Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that. 
 I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off years ago, family ain't heard of him since. Figured him for dead anyway. So this lawyer prick says, your brother died a rich man. Oil wells and shit, close to a million bucks. Jesus, it's frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get. 
 A million bucks? Jeez-Louise! You get any of that? 
 Thirty five thousand. That's what he left me. 
 Dollars? Holy shit, that's great! Like winnin' a lottery... (off Hadley's shitty look) ...ain't it? 
 Dumbshit. What do you figger the government's gonna do to me? Take a big wet bite out of my ass, is what. 
 Oh. Hadn't thought of that. 
 Maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with. Then what happens? You pay tax on the car. Repairs and maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' you to take 'em for a ride... 
 And drive it, if they're old enough. 
 That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! Then at the end of the year, if you figured the tax wrong, they make you pay out of your own pocket. Uncle Sam puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple. Always get the short end. That's a fact. (spits over the side) Some brother. Shit. 
 Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin' luck. Imagine inheriting thirty five thousand dollars. 
 What's he doing? 
 Gettin' himself killed. 
 Just keep spreadin' tar... 
 Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife? 
 That's funny. You're gonna look funnier suckin' my dick with no fuckin' teeth. 
 What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back? Try to hamstring you? 
 That's it! Step aside, Mert. This fucker's havin' hisself an accident. 
 Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's gonna throw him off the roof... 
 Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus... 
 Because if you do trust her, there's no reason in the world you can't keep every cent of that money. 
 You better start making sense. 
 If you want to keep that money, all of it, just give it to your wife. See, the IRS allows you a one-time- only gift to your spouse. It's good up to sixty thousand dollars. 
 Naw, that ain't right! Tax free? 
 Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent. 
 You're the smart banker what shot his wife. Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So's I can wind up in here with you? 
 It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS, they'll say the same thing. Actually, I feel silly telling you all this. I'm sure you would have investigated the matter yourself. 
 Fuckin'-A. I don't need no smart wife-killin' banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat. 
 Of course not. But you will need somebody to set up the tax-free gift, and that'll cost you. A lawyer, for example... 
 Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing cocksuckers! 
 ...or come to think of it, I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money. I'll write down the forms you need, you can pick them up, and I'll prepare them for your signature... nearly free of charge. (off Hadley's look) I'd only ask three beers apiece for my co-workers, if that seems fair. 
 (guffawing) Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it? Co-workers... 
 I think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion. 
 What are you jimmies starin' at? Back to work, goddamn it! 
 Drink up, boys. While it's cold. 
 (approaches with a beer) Here's a cold one, Andy. 
 No thanks. I gave up drinking. 
 Chess. Now there's a game of kings. Civilized...strategic... 
 Maybe you'll let me teach you someday. I've been thinking of getting a board together. 
 We might do business on a board. But the pieces, I'd like to carve those myself. One side done in quartz... the opposing side in limestone. 
 Years I've got. What I don't have are the rocks. Pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim. 
 (smiles) Not yet. I suppose I should. 
 I suppose we are. 
 I'm innocent, remember? Just like everybody else here. 
 What are you in for, Red? 
 Innocent? 
 I know. I've seen it three times this month already. 
 Can we talk business? 
 Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 
 Weeks? 
 Take a walk. 
 I have to change reels. 
 I said fuck off. 
 I know. I've seen it three times this month already. 
 Can we talk business? 
 Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 
 Weeks? 
 Take a walk. 
 I have to change reels. 
 I said fuck off. 
 Ain't you gonna scream? 
 They'd never hear me over that. Let's get this over with. 
 Me first. 
 Okay. 
 Fuck! Shit! He broke my nose! 
 Now I'm gonna open my fly, and you're gonna swallow what I give you to swallow. And when you d mine, you gonna swallow Rooster's. You done broke his nose, so he ought to have somethin' to show for it. 
 Anything you put in my mouth, you're going to lose. 
 You don't understand. You do that, I'll put all eight inches of this steel ii your ear. 
 Okay. But you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down. Hard. (faint smile) In fact, I understand the bite-reflex is so strong the victim's jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar. 
 You little fuck. 
 Time's up, Bogs. 
 (O.S.) Return to your cellblocks for evening count. 
 Damn, Byron. Look'a that. 
 Poor fella must'a tripped. 
 Sounds good to us. Figure we owe him for the beer. 
 That ain't quartz. Nor limestone. 
 What are you, fuckin' geologist? 
 He's right, it ain't. 
 What the hell is it then? 
 Bullshit. 
 (O.S.) Lights out! 
 Heads up. They're tossin' cells. 
 What kind'a contraband you hiding in there, boy? 
 Solitary. A week. Make sure he takes his Bible. 
 Too goddamn dark to read down there. 
 Add another week for blasphemy. 
 Let's try the second tier. 
 Good evening. 
 I'm pleased to see you reading this. Any favorite passages? 
 Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house cometh. 
 (smiles) Luke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I've always liked that one. (strolls the cell) But I prefer: "I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." 
 John. Chapter 8, verse 12. 
 I hear you're good with numbers. How nice. A man should have a skill. 
 You wanna explain this? 
 It's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks. Little hobby of mine. 
 Looks pretty clean. Some contraband here, nothing to get in a twist over. 
 I can't say I approve of this... (turns to Andy) ...but I suppose exceptions can always be made. 
 I almost forgot. 
 I'd hate to deprive you of this. Salvation lies within. 
 DUFRESNE! YOU'RE OFF THE LINE! 
 My wife made that in church group. 
 It's very pretty, sir. 
 You like working in the laundry? 
 No, sir. Not especially. 
 Perhaps we can find something more befitting a man of your education. 
 Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks? 
 Andy! Thought I heard you out here! 
 I've been reassigned to you. 
 I know, they told me. Ain't that a kick in the ass? Come on in, I'll give you the dime tour. 
 Here she is, the Shawshank Prison Library. Along this side, we got the National Geographics. That side, the Reader's Digest Condensed books. Bottom shelf there, some Louis L'Amours and Erle Stanley Gardners. Every night I pile the cart and make my rounds. I write down the names on this clipboard here. Well, that's it. Easy, peasy, Japanesey. Any questions? 
 Brooks? How long have you been librarian? 
 Since 1912. Yuh, over 37 years. 
 In all that time, have you ever had an assistant? 
 Never needed one. Not much to it, is there? 
 So why now? Why me? 
 I dunno. Be nice to have some comp'ny down here for a change. 
 (O.S.) Dufresne! 
 That's him. That's the one. 
 I'm Dekins. I been, uh, thinkin' 'bout maybe settin' up some kinda trust fund for my kids' educations. 
 I see. Well. Why don't we have a seat and talk it over? 
 Pull down one'a them desks there. 
 What did you have in mind? A weekly draw on your pay? 
 Yuh. I figured just stick it in the bank, but Captain Hadley said check with you first. 
 He was right. You don't want your money in a bank. 
 I don't? 
 What's that gonna earn you? Two and a half, three percent a year? We can do a lot better than that. (wets his pen) So tell me, Mr. Dekins. Where do you want to send your kids? Harvard? Yale? 
 He didn't say that! 
 God is my witness. And Dekins, he just blinks for a second, then laughs his ass off. Afterward, he actually shook Andy's hand. 
 My ass! 
 Shook his fuckin' hand. Just about shit myself. All Andy needed was a suit and tie, a jiggly little hula girl on his desk, he would'a been Mister Dufresne, if you please. 
 I wouldn't say "friends." I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning. That's a wonderful pet to have. 
 Maybe it can do more than that. (off their looks) How about expanding the library? Get some new books in there. 
 How you 'spect to do that, "Mr. Dufresne-if-you-please?" 
 Ask the warden for funds. 
 Son, I've had six wardens through here during my tenure, and I have learned one great immutable truth of the universe: ain't one of 'em been born whose asshole don't pucker up tight as a snare drum when you ask for funds. 
 Not a dime. My budget's stretched thin as it is. 
 I see. Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds directly from them. 
 Far as them Republican boys in Augusta are concerned, there's only three ways to spend the taxpayer's hard-earned when it come to prisons. More walls. More bars. More guards. 
 Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. I'll send a letter a week. They can't ignore me forever. 
 They sure can, but you write your letters if it makes you happy. I'll even mail 'em for you, how's that? 
 Moresby Prison issued you that gun, but you actually had to pay for it? 
 See, that's all deductible. You get to write that off. 
 Say Red, could you hand me a stack of those 1040s? 
 Red? Andy? It's Brooks. 
 C'mon, Brooksie, why don't you just calm the fuck down, okay? 
 Goddamn miserable puke-eatin' sons of whores! 
 You tell me, man. One second he was fine, then out came the knife. I better get the guards. 
 Nothing left to talk about! It's all talked out! Nothing left now but to cut his fuckin' throat! 
 That's what they want! It's the price I gotta pay! 
 Brooks, you're not going to hurt Heywood, we all know that. Even Heywood knows it, right Heywood? 
 (nods, terrified) Sure. I know that. Sure. 
 Why? Ask anyone, they'll tell you. Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man. 
 You're not fooling anybody, so just put the damn knife down and stop scaring the shit out of people. 
 But it's the only way they'll let me stay. 
 Take it easy. You'll be all right. 
 Him? What about me? Crazy old fool! Goddamn near slit my throat! 
 Nothin'! Just came in to say fare-thee-well. (off their looks) Ain't you heard? His parole came through! 
 I just don't understand what happened in there, that's all. 
 Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse, is what. 
 Institutionalized, my ass. 
 Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass. 
 Shit. I could never get that way. 
 (softly) Say that when you been inside as long as Brooks has. 
 I can't take care of you no more. You go on now. You're free. 
 (V.O.) Dear Fellas. I can't believe how fast things move on the outside. 
 (V.O.) I saw an automobile once when I was young. Now they're everywhere. 
 (V.O.) The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry. 
 No music in your room after eight p.m. No guests after nine. No cooking except on the hotplate... 
 (V.O.) People even talk faster. And louder. 
 (V.O.) The parole board got me into this halfway house called the Brewster, and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway... 
 Make sure he double-bags. Last time your man didn't double-bag and the bottom near came out. 
 You double-bag like the lady says, understand? 
 Yes sir, double-bag, surely will. 
 (V.O.) It's hard work. I try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the time. I don't think the store manager likes me very much. 
 (V.O.) Sometimes after work I go to the park and feed the birds. I keep thinking Jake might show up and say hello, but he never does. I hope wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends. 
 (V.O.) I have trouble sleeping at night. The bed is too big. I have bad dreams, like I'm falling. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am. 
 (V.O.) Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home. I could shoot the manager while I was at it, sort of like a bonus. 
 (V.O.) But I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore. 
 (V.O.) I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided not to stay. 
 (V.O.) I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. Not for an old crook like me. 
 P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat. No hard feelings. 
 Red! 
 Water break! Five minutes! 
 That's real pretty, Red. Nice work. 
 Shovel man in. Watch the dirt. 
 What the fuck. 
 (follows his gaze) HEY.' YOU MEN UP THERE.' GET YOUR ASSES OFF THAT SLOPE! (works his rifle bolt) YOU HAPPY ASSHOLES GONE DEAF? YOU GOT FIVE SECONDS 'FORE I SHOOT 
! 
 What am I, talkin' to myself? 
 Dufresne! What the fuck did you do? (Andy looks up) Your ass, warden's office, now! 
 What is all this? 
 You tell me, fuck-stick! They're addressed to you, every damn one! 
 Well, take it. 
 Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to your repeated inquiries, the State Senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project... " (stunned, examines check) This is two hundred dollars. 
 In addition, the Library District has generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and sundries. We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed. Please stop sending us letters. Yours truly, the State Comptroller's Office. 
 I want all this cleared out before the warden gets back, I shit you not. 
 Good for you, Andy. 
 Only took six years. (beat) From now on, I send two letters a week instead of one. 
 (laughs, shakes his head) I believe you're crazy enough. You better get this stuff downstairs like the Captain said. I'm gonna go pinch a loaf. When I get back, this is all gone, right? 
 Andy? You hear that? 
 (O.S.) LET ME OUUUUT! 
 Couldn't play somethin' good, huh? Hank Williams? 
 They broke the door down before I could take requests. 
 Was it worth two weeks in the hole? 
 Easiest time I ever did. 
 Shit. No such thing as easy time in the hole. A week seems like a year. 
 I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. Hardly felt the time at all. 
 (taps his heart, his head) The music was here...and here. That's the one thing they can't confiscate, not ever. That's the beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt that way about music, Red? 
 Here's where it makes most sense. We need it so we don't forget. 
 That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope. 
 (softly) Like Brooks did? 
 #2 You feel you've been rehabilitated? 
 You wonder where it went. I wonder where ten years went. 
 Anniversary gift. Open it. 
 Had to go through one of your competitors. Hope you don't mind. Wanted it to be a surprise. 
 You gonna play something? 
 Treasure Island. Robert Louis... 
 (jotting) ...Stevenson. Next? 
 Trade skills and hobbies, those go under educational. Stack right behind you. 
 The Count of Monte Crisco... 
 Cristo, you dumbshit. 
 ...by Alexandree Dumb-ass. 
 Dumas. You boys'll like that one. It's about a prison break. 
 ...a genuine, progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation. Our inmates, properly supervised, will be put to work outside these walls performing all manner of public service. Cutting pulpwood, repairing bridges and causeways, digging storm drains... 
 These men can learn the value of an honest day's labor while providing a valuable service to the community -- and at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer! 
 Sounds like road-gangin', you ask me. 
 You there! You men! We're gonna take your picture now! 
 Give us a break, lady. 
 Don't you know who I am? I'm from LIFE magazine! I was told I'd get some co-operation out here! You want me to report you to your warden? Is that what you want? 
 (sighs) No, ma'am. 
 That's more like it! Now I want you all in a row with big bright smiles on your faces! Grab hold of your tools and show 'em to me! 
 You heard the lady. 
 C'mon! We're showin' our tools and grinnin' like fools! Take the damn picture! 
 Ned, we're providing a valuable community service. 
 Ned, I wouldn't worry too much over this contract. Seems to me I've already got my boys committed elsewhere. You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie. 
 Two deposits, Casco Bank and New England First. Night drop, like always. 
 Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot. Tell 'em if they over- starch my shirts again, they're gonna hear about it from me. (adjusts his tie) How do I look? 
 Very nice. 
 Big charity to-do up Portland way. Governor's gonna be there. (indicates pie) Want the rest of that? Woman can't bake worth shit. 
 What you hear isn't half of it. He's got scams you haven't dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. There's a river of dirty money flowing through this place. 
 That's where I come in. I channel it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, securities, tax free municipals... I send that money out into the big world. And when it comes back... 
 Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, I will have made him a millionaire. 
 (smiles) I thought you had more faith in me than that. 
 Sure it will. But not to me, and certainly not to the warden. 
 Peter Stevens. 
 The silent, silent partner. He's the guilty one, your Honor. The man with the bank accounts. That's where the filtering process starts. They trace it back, all they're gonna find is him. 
 A phantom. An apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. (off Red's look) I conjured him out of thin air. He doesn't exist...except on paper. 
 Sure you can, if you know how the system works, and where the cracks are. It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate, social security card, driver's license. They ever track those accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination. 
 It's funny. On the outside, I was an honest man. Straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook. 
 I don't run the scams, Red, I just process the profits. That's a fine line, maybe. But I've also built that library, and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas. Why do you think the warden lets me do all that? 
 I work cheap. That's the trade-off. 
 Well. Ain't this for shit? 
 (slapping his gloves) C'mon there, old boys! Movin' like molasses! Makin' me look bad! 
 ...so I'm backin' out the door, right? Had the TV like this... (mimes his grip) Big ol' thing. Couldn't see shit. Suddenly, here's this voice: Freeze kid! Hands in the air! Well I just stand there holdin' on to that TV, so the voice says: "You hear what I said, boy?" And I say, Yes sir, I sure did! But if I drop this fuckin' thing, you got me on destruction of property too! 
 You did a stretch in Cashman too? 
 Yeah. That was an easy ride, let me tell you. Work programs, weekend furloughs. Not like here. 
 Sounds like you done time all over New England. 
 Been in and out since I was 13. Name the place, chances are I been there. 
 Perhaps it's time you considered a new profession. (the game stalls) What I mean is, you don't seem to be a very good thief. Maybe you should try something else. 
 What the hell you know about it, Capone? What are you in for? 
 (wry glance to Red) Everyone's innocent in here. Don't you know that? 
 ...said we can stay with them, but Joey's gettin' out of the service next month, and they barely got enough room as it is. Plus they got Poppa workin' double shifts and the baby cries half the night. I just don't know where we're gonna go... 
 I'm thinkin' maybe I should try for high school equivalency. Hear you helped some fellas with that. 
 I don't waste time on losers, Tommy. 
 (tight) I ain't no goddamn loser. 
 That's a good start. If we do this, we do it all the way. One hundred percent. Nothing half-assed. 
 Thing is, see... (leans in, mutters) ...I don't read all that good. 
 (smiles) Well. You've come to the right place then. 
 ...and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor...and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted nevermore! " 
 So this raven just sits there and won't go away? 
 That's right. 
 (beat) Why don't that fella get hisself a 12-gauge and dust the fucker? 
 The cat sh--The cat shh... (glances up) The cat shat on the welcome mat? 
 The cat sh--shh--shimmied up the tree and crept st--stel--stealthily out on the limb... 
 Well? 
 Well. It's for shit. (gets up in disgust) Wasted a whole fuckin' year of my time with this bullshit! 
 May not be as bad as you think. 
 It's worse! I didn't get a fuckin' thing right! Might as well be in Chinese! 
 We'll see how the score comes out. 
 I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out... 
 Two points! Right there! There's your goddamn score! (storms out) Goddamn cats crawlin' up trees, 5 times 5 is 25, fuck this place, fuck it! 
 I feel bad. I let him down. 
 Smart fella, ain't he? 
 What's he in for anyway? 
 The hell you say. 
 (bare whisper) Oh my God... 
 'Bout four years ago, I was in Thomaston on a 2 to 3 stretch. Stole a car. Dumbfuck thing to do. (beat) Few months left to go, I get a new cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big twitchy fucker. Crazy eyes. Kind of roomie you pray you don't get, know what I'm sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed burglary. Said he done hundreds of jobs. Hard to believe, high-strung as he was. Cut a loud fart, he'd go three feet in the air. Talked all the time, too, that's the other thing. Never shut up. Places he'd been, jobs he pulled, women he fucked. Even people he killed. People that gave him shit, that's how he put it. One night, like a joke, I say: "Yeah? Who'd you kill?" So he says... 
 ...I got me this job one time bussin' tables at a country club. So I could case all the big rich pricks that come in. I pick out this guy, go in one night and do his place. He wakes up and gives me shit. So I killed him. Him and the tasty bitch he was with. (starts laughing) That's the best part! She's fuckin' this prick, see, this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy! Some hotshot banker. He's the one they pinned it on! They got him down-Maine somewhere doin' time for the crime! Ain't that choice? 
 Well. I have to say, that's the most amazing story I ever heard. What amazes me most is you were taken in by it. 
 Sir? 
 It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you. He hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up. He's young, not terribly bright. Not surprising he didn't know what a state he'd put you in. 
 I think he's telling the truth. 
 Let's say for a moment Blatch does exist. You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, "Yes, I did it! I confess! By all means, please add a life term to my sentence!" 
 It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial. 
 That's assuming Blatch is even still there. Chances are excellent he'd be released by now. Excellent. 
 They'd have his last known address. Names of relatives... (Norton shakes his head) Well it's a chance. isn't it? How can you be so obtuse? 
 What? What did you call me? 
 Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The country club will have his old time cards! W-2s with his name on them! 
 (rises) Dufresne, if you want to indulge this fantasy, that's your business. Don't make it mine. This meeting's over. 
 Look, if it's the squeeze, don't worry. I'd never say what goes on in here. I'd be just as indictable as you for laundering the money! 
 Don't you ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch! Not in this office, not anywhere! (slaps intercom) Get in here! Now! 
 I was just trying to rest your mind at ease, that's all. 
 (as GUARDS enter) Solitary! A month! 
 What's the matter with you? It's my chance to get out, don't you see that? It's my life! Don't you understand it's my life? 
 A month in the hole. Longest damn stretch I ever heard of. 
 It's my fault. 
 Red? You saying Andy's innocent? I mean for real innocent? (Red nods) Sweet Jesus. How long's he been in here? 
 Thomas Williams! 
 The son of a bitch mailed it. 
 Thumb up my butt sounds better. 
 C'mon, just throw it away. Will you please? Just throw it away? 
 Kid passed. C-plus average. Thought you'd like to know. 
 Warden wants to talk. 
 Out here? 
 That's what the man said. 
 Warden? 
 Tommy, we've got a situation here. I think you can appreciate that. 
 Yes sir, I sure can. 
 I tell you, son, this really came along and knocked my wind out. It's got me up nights, that's the truth. 
 The right decision. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what that is. You understand? (Tommy nods) Think hard, Tommy. If I'm gonna move on this, there can't be the least little shred of doubt. I have to know if you what you told Dufresne was the truth. 
 Yes sir. Absolutely. 
 Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...having placed your hand on the Good Book and taken an oath before Almighty God Himself? 
 Just gimme that chance. 
 That's what I thought. 
 Terrible thing. Man that young, less than a year to go, trying to escape. Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him, truly it did. 
 I'm done. It stops right now. Get H&R Block to declare your income. 
 Nothing stops! NOTHING! (tight) Or you will do the hardest time there is. No more protection from the guards. I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton and put you in (MORE) 
 My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book. Complained about it all the time. (pause) She was beautiful. I loved her. But I guess I couldn't show it enough. (softly) I killed her, Red. 
 I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she died. Because of me, the way I am. 
 No. I didn't. Someone else did, and I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess. 
 It floats around. Has to land on somebody. Say a storm comes through. Some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain. The house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. (softly) I just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has. (glances to him) Think you'll ever get out of here? 
 Tell you where I'd go. Zihuatanejo. 
 Mexico. Little place right on the Pacific. You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? They say it has no memory. That's where I'd like to finish out my life, Red. A warm place with no memory. Open a little hotel right on the beach. Buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new. Take my guests out charter fishing. (beat) You know, a place like that, I'd need a man who can get things. 
 You underestimate yourself. 
 Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover, and whatever mistakes I made I've paid for and then some. That hotel and that boat...I don't think it's too much to want. To look at the stars just after sunset. Touch the sand. Wade in the water. Feel free. 
 You're right. It's down there, and I'm in here. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying. 
 (turns back) Red, if you ever get out of here, do me a favor. There's this big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is? 
 One in particular. Got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end. Like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my (MORE) 
 You'll just have to pry up that rock and see. 
 We ought to keep an eye on him. 
 That's fine, during the day. But at night he's got that cell all to himself. 
 Oh Lord. Andy come down to the loading dock today. Asked me for a length of rope. Six foot long. 
 Shit! You gave it to him? 
 Sure I did. I mean why wouldn't I? 
 Christ! Remember Brooks Hatlen? 
 How the hell was I s'pose to know? 
 Andy'd never do that. Never. 
 Where the hell is he? 
 Probably still up in the warden's. 
 (via bullhorn) YOU MEN! YOU HEAR THAT ANNOUNCEMENT OR ZUST TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND? 
 Christ. What do we do? 
 Nothing we can do. Not tonight. 
 Let's pull him aside tomorrow, all of us. Have a word with him. Ain't that right, Red? 
 Lickety-split. I wanna get home. 
 Just about done, sir. 
 Three deposits tonight. 
 Get my stuff down t'laundry. And shine my shoes. I want 'em lookin' like mirrors. (pauses at door) Nice havin' you back, Andy. Place just wasn't the same without you. 
 (O.S.) Open number twelve! 
 (O.S.) Lights out! 
 Man missing on tier two! Cell 12! 
 Dufresne? Get your ass out here, boy! You're holding up the show! (no answer) Don't make me come down there now! I'll thump your skull for you! 
 Dufresne, dammit, you're putting me behind! You better be sick or dead in there, I shit you not! 
 
 WHAT THE FUCK! 
 I want every man on that cellblock questioned! Start with that friend of his! 
 who? 
 Him. 
 What do you mean "he just wasn't here?" Don't say that to me, Haig! Don't say that to me again! 
 But sir! He wasn't! He isn't! 
 I can see that, Haig! You think I'm blind? Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig? 
 No sir! 
 What about you? You blind? Tell me what this is! 
 Last night's count. 
 You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! Right there, see? "Dufresne." He was in his cell at lights out! Stands to reason he'd still be here this morning! I want him found! Not tomorrow, not after breakfast! Now! 
 Well? 
 I see you two all the time, you're thick as thieves, you are! He must'a said something! 
 Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind! Nothin' left but some damn rocks on the windowsill and that cupcake on the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she knows! What say there, Fuzzy- Britches? Feel like talking? Guess not. Why should you be different? 
 It's a conspiracy! (SMASH) That's what this is! (SMASH) It's one big damn conspiracy! (SMASH) And everyone's in on it! (SMASH) Including her! 
 Warden? There's a space here between the walls 'bout three feet across! Smells pretty damn bad! 
 (O.S.) I don't care what it smells like! 
 (O.S.) Go on, boy! We got a hold of you! 
 Hoo-whee! Smell's gettin' worse! 
 (O.S.) Never mind, I said! Just keep going! 
 Smells pretty damn bad, Warden! In fact, it smells just like shit. 
 Oh God, that's what it is, it's shit. oh my God it's shit. pull me out 'fore I blow my groceries, oh shit it's shit, oh my Gawwwwwwd! 
 Lickety-split. I wanna get home. 
 Just about done, sir. 
 (O.S.) May I help you? 
 My name is Peter Stevens. I've come to close out some accounts. 
 
 Thank you. I'm sure I will. 
 Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else? 
 Please. Would you add this to your outgoing mail? 
 Hal! Dave! Get your butts in here! 
 I'm not sure which one it is... 
 #1 Your file says you've served forty years of a life sentence. You feel you've been rehabilitated? 
 #1 Shall I repeat the question? 
 #2 Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society as a-- 
 (motions him over) You don't need to ask me every time you go take a piss. Just go. Understand? 
 (V.O.) Dear Red. If you're reading this, you've gotten out. And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You remember the name of the town, don't you? I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready. (beat) Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well. Your friend. Andy.

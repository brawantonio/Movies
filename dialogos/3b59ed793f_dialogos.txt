... 
 A. 
 (V.O.) You'll be saving American lives. 
 #1 Put your hands on your head and turn around slowly! 
. 
 (in Russian) Give me your gun and radio. 
 (in Russian) My argument is not with you. 
 (V.O.) So we got in the way?   Is that why Neski died? Is that why you killed Marie? 
 (V.O.) You killed Marie the minute you climbed into her car.   The minute you entered her life she was dead! 
 (V.O.) I told you people to leave me alone! I fell off the grid. I was half way around the world. 
 (V.O.) There's no place it won't catch up to you. It's how every story ends. It's what you are, Jason. A killer! You always will be. 
! 
 We think that's Bourne hitting him on the head and then-- 
 (V.O.) Go ahead!     Go on! Do it! 
 (V.O.) She wouldn't want me to. That's the only reason your alive. 
 Who's "she?" 
 His girlfriend, Marie. She was killed in India three weeks ago. 
 A dirty section chief in league with a corrupt Russian Billionaire commits suicide when confronted by Jason Bourne. You couldn't make this stuff up. (holds up the photo of Abbot dead) You watched this happen? 
 Bourne's last confirmed location is Moscow, three days ago? 
 Right. 
 So what does he do now? 
 I think he's looking for something he hasn't found. 
 Like what?     What's he after? 
 I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't gotten his memory back yet.  Not all of it. 
 Pam, what I need to know is, what kind of a threat is he to us? 
 If he just wanted to hurt us he could have sent this tape to CNN. 
 Maybe he still will. Maybe he gave it to you because he wants to throw you in the opposite direction of his real plan. I don't know. I just know my number one rule is "the only way to stay safe is to assume the worst."   As far as I'm concerned Bourne is a serious threat until proven otherwise. 
 (with poster) ...This one's three years ago -- had half of Interpol after him -- disappeared...Turned up in Naples -- Berlin -- Moscow -- disappeared again... (Daniels says nothing) The girl he was on he run with -- Marie Kreutz -- she turned up dead halfway around the world, from a sniper's bullet... (beat) What connects the dots? Is it Treadstone? 
 Turn off that tape recorder. 
 Where is my sister? 
 She's dead. She was killed. 
 I knew it was going to end this way. It was always going to end this way... 
 I didn't believe that. 
 Why did she die? 
 She was shot. A man came for me. 
 And then you killed him. 
 Now what? 
 Someone started all this...and I'm going to find them. 
. 
 (in French) Who started Treadstone? 
 (in French, to bodyguard) It's OK! (in French, to Bourne) They're still looking for you. You are taking a big risk coming here. 
 (in French) Just tell me what I want to know! 
 (in French) I just provided them weapons.    I don't know who started-- 
 (in French) You know something.   Tell me where to start looking. 
 (in French) There's a journalist in London. Simon Ross. He seems to know a lot about you.   He has a source inside the program. Someone there from the beginning. What should I tell them if they contact me? 
 (in English) They give me the name I want, or I burn their entire house down to get it. 
 ...This is big -- a skein of lies -- you pull at it and it just keeps coming -- I'll fill you in when I get home. And it's not finished, either. (beat) They're calling it `Blackbriar'. 
 
#3 "Blackbriar" echelon hit. NSA, please confirm receipt. 
 Okay, send it to CRI right now. 
 We tracked the phone. Registered to a London reporter named Simon Ross. He works at the Guardian newspaper. 
 You tracking him? 
 Yeah, thanks Mike. We have a survey team covering him at work...and a sneak and peek's on their way to his apartment. 
 Well, who talked to him? How did he find out about Blackbriar? 
 We don't know, we pulled his background and ran a cross check on any known anomalies, but we've come up with nothing. But, I think if we follow Ross, we are going to be able... 
 Right. Ross is easy. I want the source. 
. 
 ROSS (VOICEOVER) Have you heard of an Operation Blackbriar? I'm going to try and get my head around this, see you first thing. 
 Is that all? 
 Yeah. 
 I want rendition protocols and I want the asset put on standby, just in case. 
 People, listen up, this is a full priority situation 
 Jimmy, give me Ross's profile on one. (points at the big screen on the wall) 
 Our target is a British national, Simon Ross, a reporter. I want all his phones, his blackberry, his apartment, his car, bank accounts, credit cards, travel patterns...I want to know what he's going to think before he does. Every dirty little secret he has. And most of all, we want the name and real time location of his source. 
 VOSEN (CONT'D) All right, let's get to it. 
#1 Copy that. Mr. Vosen, subject is entering his office. 
 Where's my picture please? 
#2 Coming online...Online...Now. 
#3 Take an hour to get his phone... 
 That's too long. 
 So how do we know he's not spinning for someone? 
 There's more. He was scared. 
 Scared of what? 
 Blackbriar. 
 Sorry, a call for you. 
 Who is it? 
 Won't give hie name. 
 He's on my line... 
 Why aren't we hearing this? 
 That's a hard line, Jimmy, why don't we have it? 
 We have his line, sir, but he's not on it. 
 (V.O.) Waterloo Station, south entrance, thirty minutes. 
 Who is this? 
 (V.O.) This is Jason Bourne. 
 (V.O.) Are you getting an image? 
 Okay, he is on the move.   Target is mobile. 
 Okay, people, look sharp, give me eyeballs on the street. 
 Subject is on the move. Go mobile One and Two. 
 Where's that audio on the street? I want to know where he's going... 
 2 (over radio) We have the subject confirmed. 
 Where is he heading? 
 2 Waterloo Station. 
 (V.O.) Stand by at Waterloo... 
 Hello? 
 (O.S.) Don't ask questions. Just listen... 
 What's he doing? I thought we blocked his cell? Who the hell is he talking to??? 
 Jimmy, I need that phone! 
 (beat) Activate the asset. 
 Sir, we haven't yet become operational -- 
 I said activate the asset.   I want options. 
 What's the ROE on this one? 
 (O.S.) To your left. Blue hooded top. Walking towards the bus stop 
 Okay, who's the guy in the blue hood? 
 Okay, there, he's talking to the guy with the hood. Take them down. 
. 
 Watch that bus! The bus! -- don't lose them! Stay triangular and don't get blocked. 
? Grab Team B. Grab the hoody and stay with Ross... 
 Take the footbridge. Go to the West Entrance. I'll meet you at the newsstand. 
 No, no, look...Ross is not on the bus.   Split up the team -- get the guy on the bus and send someone to stay on Ross. 
 (to Hoody) You. On the floor. Down. 
 Driver, stop the bus! 
 I don't like this. Patch me through to Met surveillance. 
 Why do you know so much about me? 
 What? 
 The article. You talked to someone from Treadstone. Someone there at the beginning.  What's his name? 
 I can't tell you that.... Who's following me? 
 Whoever they are it's trouble. 
 Are they Blackbriar? 
 Blackbriar, what's Blackbriar? 
 I don't know. I heard the name this morning for the first time. Whatever it is, my source said it started with you. 
 What? What are you talking about? 
 Look, just help me get away from these people...and we can talk more...we can-- 
 (spotting approaching operatives) We have to move. 
 Answer your phone. 
 He's got to be close. Seal the entrances. 
 (O.C.) Three o'clock. Female. Blonde black top. 
 Has she seen me? 
 Not yet. Dip left past the photo kiosk. 
 BOURNE (CONT'D) Straight ahead. News kiosk. 
 BOURNE (CONT'D) Change of plan. Stop. Tie your shoelace. 
 Are we clear? 
 Clear. News kiosk. Straight ahead. 
 Straight toward me.     Bin man? 
 Negative. 
 He's got a gun. 
 Negative.    Keep straight ahead. 
#1 We got a hit. Middle of the concourse. 
 We're losing him! We cannot afford to lose him! 
 Waterloo concourse. Subject heading east. 
 Get into cover. Now! 
 64H             What's the status of the asset?                     64H 
 In place in one minute. 
 Alright, I want to take him now. Get him out of there and have the asset cover it. 
 Target moving towards the stores. 
 Asset in play. ETA thirty seconds. All exits covered. 
 Keep moving... 
 BOURNE (CONT'D) Faster.... 
 BOURNE (CONT'D) The front... 
 BOURNE (CONT'D) GET IN THE STORE. 
 INSIDE! 
 Service doorway -- Now! 
 2 Store.   Three means of egress. 
 Close him down... 
 Keep moving. 
 BOURNE (CONT'D) Through the store room. 
 Jesus Christ, that's Jason Bourne. 
 Maybe he's the source? 
 It doesn't matter, the asset now has 2 targets. Take them both out. 
 I'm going to get you to safety but you have to stay calm do exactly what I say. 
 (fear-induced autopilot) Sure, okay. 
 No, listen to me: Exactly what I say this time. Understand? 
 Yes. 
 Stay here while I look for an escape. 
 No, stay behind that door. 
 There. That silver door. Bourne's behind that door? 
 Confirmed. 
 Okay, pull the agents back and give Bourne's location to the asset. 
 
 
 ROSS (TEL. V.O.) I'm going to go for it, okay? 
 Don't move until I tell you. 
 I'm going to go for it. 
 No, No not now. 
 Oh...shit... 
 VOSEN (CONT'D) Get the asset out of there ... 
 What about Bourne? 
 Get him out of there - NOW! 
. 
 BOURNE'S POV 
 Hello. 
 It's Vosen. We have a situation. 
 (to waiter) Sparkling. And a "Heart-Healthy" omelet with goat cheese and peppers. 
 You're late. Traffic? 
 (handing her the menu) Ma'am? 
 Nothing for me. 
 I'm buying. 
 When the Director called, it was suggested we bring you on-- 
 Suggested? (beat) Are you sure it was just a suggestion? 
 Funny how different things look depending on where you sit. I look at this as doing a favor for you. Giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business. 
 Meaning? 
 Jason Bourne. 
 Bourne's finished. 
 Really? 
 It was finished the moment I realized I was chasing him for something he didn't do.   The case is closed. 
 So what do you make of this? (handing her surveillance photos of Bourne in Paris) French intel picked up Bourne meeting Pierre Elattrache on Tuesday. He threatened to burn our house down if you didn't tell him who started Treadstone. That's a big problem, wouldn't you agree? 
 This doesn't feel like Bourne to me. 
 Why's it so hard for you to believe? 
 Probably because it's coming from you, Noah. 
 Lets try and be adults okay? We all thought he was done, off the grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe he's a threat. We both want the same thing here. 
 So what happened at Waterloo? 
 We have a leak. Bourne showed up in our surveillance. We had very little time to react. 
 And the reporter ended up dead? 
 Bourne saw us coming. 
 So what was he doing? 
? We don't know. But just the fact that he was there means he's up to something, don't you think? Maybe he's the source? 
 The real question is how you managed to get in a fire fight in the middle of a public train station. 
 Don't second guess an operation from an armchair, Pam. It's not fair. 
 I'm going to the office now. I'll make my own introductions. 
 This is Pamela Landy. She's gonna be quarterbacking our search effort. I think what we oughta do, just to get started, let's go around the room, say who you are and what your spec is. 
 Let's do names later. (she's got the floor) What's Bourne's last fixed position? (impatient) Anybody. 
#3 London.   Twelve hundred Zulu. 
 Status?   Wounded?   Armed? 
#2 Alive.    Mobile. Unknown. 
 Where are your grids coming from? 
#1 NSA Tactical. 
 You have an Echelon package? 
#1 Yes. 
 Why isn't it on? 
#1 We were waiting. 
 For what? (no takers) You're nine hours behind the toughest target you've ever tracked. I want everyone to sit down, strap in, and turn on all you've got. (beat) That would mean now. 
 LANDY (CONT'D) Thank you. 
 LANDY (CONT'D) I want everything you've got on Ross on screen one. 
#1 Sir, we just hacked Ross's email account at the Guardian and found a round trip ticket to Turin, yesterday. 0800 arrival, 12:05 departure. 
 I think we can be pretty certain that Bourne's not your source then? 
 How? 
 Ross's call to his editor, where he said he just met the source on Blackbriar, took place just after his flight landed. His met his source in Turin. 
 So? 
 So, what, Bourne met Ross for breakfast and then, at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo? 
 (Needling Wills) Maybe they were even on the same flight? 
 Cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with Blackbriar SCI clearance against all calls in and out of Turin during the morning Ross was there 
 The guy you're after is a CIA operative with clearance above Top Secret.   He was committing treason by talking to Ross.   Do you really think, while doing that, he used a cell phone he knows we can track? 
 TECH 3 (JIMMY) Zero results on the cross check. 
 Do you have a better idea? 
 Yeah, I'd look at all the people whose cell phones were switched off the entire period Ross was in Turin. 
 Do it Jimmy. 
 (looks at Cronin) I mean if your people use their cell phones as much as mine do, the list should be pretty small 
 TECHNICIAN 3 JIMMY Three names: Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin, Neal Daniels. 
 Now check everything in Ross's apartment against those names. Look for common patterns, look for - 
 Initials .....Bring that up on main. 
 Neal Daniels.   He's Station Chief in Madrid now, isn't he? 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Call the RSO at the Embassy and have them take Daniels into custody if he's there.   If he's not, get a grab team to the Calle Norte safe house. Send them in heavy and tell them we'll assist with entry. 
 "Heavy?" Daniels isn't-- 
 I'm worried about Bourne. If he's not Ross's source, then he must be after Ross's source -- just like us. 
 TECH 1. (LUCY) Parque Vasquez is clean. No sign of subject. 
 Team two, ETA Callee Norte? 
 FILTERED V.O. (KILEY) Three minutes. 
#3 Sir, they're at the front door. 
 We're in. 
 Okay, put it live. 
 Alarm's down. 
 That has to be Bourne. 
 (into mike) Safe's cleaned out. 
 Shit...    Track the passports. 
 Goddamn it! Get a back-up team in there! 
 How long till back-up arrives? 
 How long? (beat, loud, to the entire hub) Stop! Hang on. I have an idea... 
 What are you doing here? 
 Where's Daniels? 
 Who is this? 
 Nicky, I need to do an ID challenge first. Code in: "Sparrow." 
 Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How long have you been on site? 
 We have two officers on site. Are you in contact with them? 
 Is there any sign of Daniels? 
 Nicky, this is Pam Landy. We have reason to believe there is a connection between Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne. 
 No, some people are convinced he's still a threat. I disagree but to find out I need to talk to him. 
 Hold on Nicky. 
 What are you doing? You know Bourne's probably listening. 
 How long till back up arrives. 
 VOSEN (CONT'D) (into microphone again) Listen, Nicky. I want you to stay put and secure the premises. It could be an hour until another team arrives. 
 How long do I have? 
 2 minutes to safehouse. 
 BOURNE (SUBTITLE) 334 Calle Norte. I hear gunfire. And men shouting. I think they're Americans -- 
 You "disagree" he's a threat? He just took out two more of my men. Not to mention his ultimatum to Ellatrache? 
 The only way this has a happy ending, Noah, is if we find a way to bring Bourne in voluntarily. 
 He wants revenge, Pam. The only realistic way to deal with this is to eliminate the threat. 
 Okay, where is Daniels headed? 
 Okay, Tangier is about 300 miles away, we can make the morning ferry. 
 Manos Arriba! Manos Arriba! 
 Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective immediately. 
 We lost Bourne. 
 You still think he's after Daniels? 
 Yeah. Nicky's just the means. But if we find Daniels, we'll find Bourne. 
 Daniels knows way too much. Daniels knows everything. We can't let them meet. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Good. (beat) And fill Hirsch in.     Just in case. 
 Do you know who this is? 
 I have to get back to the beginning...or I'll never be free of this. 
 I think he started Treadstone.    I remember meeting him.   I remember the first day... (beat) Daniels brought me to him. 
 An initiation...I guess... 
 Why are you helping me? 
 NICKY (CONT'D) You really don't remember anything? 
 No. 
 BOURNE (CONT'D) We should move. 
 (to voiceprint mic) Noah Vosen. 
 They tracked Daniels' passport to a hotel in Tangier. They're holding up a bank transfer he made to keep him in place while they move an asset in from Casablanca. 
 Since when do you have authorization for lethal action against Daniels? 
 Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar safe and fled to Morocco! 
 So grab him-- 
 I don't have the people on the ground to do that and I'm not going to risk that file falling into the wrong hands. 
 What's going on?    What's Daniels got? 
 What's he got? He ran all of Blackbriar's operations in Southern Europe and North Africa. 
 I think the world's well aware we have a rendition and lethal action capability at this point, Noah. 
 For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got our entire playbook. Names, dates, ghost sites, how we train our assets..... 
 You still don't have the authority to kill him. 
 Oh, yes I do, Pam. 
 That's what makes us special. No red tape. No more getting badguys in our sights and then watching them escape while we wait for some bureaucrat to issue the order. 
 You just decide? No oversight. No checks and balances. 
 Come on, Pam, you've seen the raw intel. You know how real the threat is.    We can't afford to have our hands tied like that anymore. 
... 
 It's Pamela Landy for him. Would you tell him it's urgent? 
 ASSISTANT (PHONE V.O.) It's Pam Landy. She says it's urgent. 
 Tell her I'm unreachable. 
 Give me the subject's location. 
 Get an elevation and a floor plan, tic-tac-toe. Locate the room. Give the asset Daniels's location and the route between Daniel's hotel and the bank. 
 Do we have that room yet? 
 TECH 2(ARKI) Yes sir Room 117. 
 Get the hotel's trunk line. Run all calls through here with an iso on 117 
 Sir, the asset is acquiring the materials. 
 Now they found Daniels, do you know where he is? 
 Find out who. 
 Tell him you're going to meet him and that you have a new phone for him. 
 We're not going to stop him. We're going to follow him. He'll take us right to Daniels. 
 TECH (LUCY) Sir, the asset is deviating. 
 Find out why. 
 TECH (LUCY) Asset unscheduled stop. 
 Sir, the asset is on the move, in route to subject. 
 #1 Sir, the asset is back on course. 
 Sir, we have an unauthorized breach. Someone with active system knowledge has penetrated out protocols. Information was passed to the asset at 14.11. (beat) The trace is confirmed and valid. It comes from a computer belonging to Nicky Parsons. 
 Where did the course deviation occur? 
 TECH (LUCY) South to Rue Belgique. Stationery at Place de France. 
 That's where Parson's is. 
 When we're finished with Daniels send the asset after her. We find Parsons, we find Bourne. 
 LANDY (OVERLAPPING) (going to Vosen, firm) Noah, what are you doing? 
 Not now. 
 Now.   I want to know what's going on. 
 Not now. 
 I'm asking on what basis you're continuing this operation. 
 On the basis that Nicky Parsons has compromised a covert operation. She is up to her neck in it. 
 This is about Daniels, not Nicky! 
 She has betrayed us! 
 You don't know the circumstances! 
 She's in league with Jason Bourne for Chrissake! 
 You don't have the authority to kill her or Bourne! 
 Yes, I do Pam, it's right here and it's legal. 
 She's one of our own.   You start down this path...where does it end?! 
 It ends when we've won. 
 Notify the asset of the additional target. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Have the bank release the funds.

 Alright, we need to be dead.    You need to code that in. 
 I want to be sure. Have the station chief in Rabat confirm the deaths and do a sub-rosa check...And keep and eye on Landy. 
 The hub just got word Bourne and Nicky are dead. 
 Confirmed? 
 Not yet. 
 Get me a copy of Bourne's personnel file. 
 I can see all their faces. But I can't remember any names.... 
 I was starting to remember who they were...in India...with Marie. 
 I've killed people and I've tried to apologize for what I've done, for what I am. None of it makes it better... 
 They're going to come for you again. You are going to have to run now. 
 It gets easier. 
 Station chief in Rabat just called, they found a body. Bourne? 
 Desh. 
 Pam, You need to see this. 
 CRONIN (CONT'D) This passport just cleared Immigration at JFK ten minutes ago. It's an early Treadstone identity registered to Jason Bourne but he never used it and it never went to the grid. Bourne's alive. 
 They don't know. 
 No, if they knew Vosen wouldn't be in his office right now. 
 (O.S.) It's a hell of a risk. 
 (O.S.) Yeah. Maybe Bourne wants us to know, just like Naples, maybe he's communicating. 
 Maybe he's trying to communicate with you. 
 Maybe we should communicate back. Because I think I know what Bourne's looking for. 
 Pamela Landy. 
 I hear you're still looking for me. 
 Bourne? 
 WILLS (TEL. V.O.) Get in here! Bourne called Landy! 
 I guess I owe you an apology. 
 (V.O.) Is that official? 
 VOSEN (OVERLAPPING) Are we triangulating?! 
 (V.O.) No. Off the record. You know how it is. 
 (V.O.) Good-bye. 
 Wait.     Wait. 
 David Webb. That's your real name. 
 Why the hell did she give him that? 
 (V.O.) You were born 4/15/71 in Nixa, Missouri. 
 Why don't you come in, and we'll talk about it? (beat) Bourne? 
 Get some rest, Pam. 
 (V.O.) You look tired. 
 (rushing out) He's got line of sight on us! 
 ...This is a national security emergency. We have an imminent threat. 
 Jason Bourne is alive and at large in New York City. We believe in one thousand yards of this building. I want an immediate twelve block lockdown of the area. Send a FLASH message to Langley, prep for local backup assistance. 
 Landy just left the building. 
 Check Landy's phone.   Is she using it? 
 Nothing?   No calls since Bourne-- ? 
 What the hell do you mean we can't read it? 
 Working on it-- 
 (frustrated) How do you know a text came if you can't read it-- (to Wills) Are we on Landy? 
 Six men.   More on the way. 
 I want that goddamn text.   We need to get out in front of her! 
 Seconds... 
 TECH (CONT'D) Got it! 
 Surround it. Anyone not on Landy goes to Tudor City. Now! (to Wills) Get the trucks. We're going mobile. 
 3 Copy, we're going to take a left at 41st. One block, settle at the corner. 
 Get the map up. 
 4 It's a bad place to pick, it's too exposed. 
 He wouldn't have chosen it if he didn't have a reason. 
 3 (V.O.) Okay folks here we go, box at two hundred meters. Let's lock it down. 
 As soon as you have eyes on Landy, I want to know. 
 3 Okay, here we go. 
 Copy that, I see her. 
 VOSEN (CONT'D) Any sign of Bourne? 
 Noah Vosen. 
 (V.O.) This is Jason Bourne. 
 How did you get this number? 
 (V.O.) You didn't actually think I was coming to Tudor City, did you? 
 No, I guess not. But if it's me you want to talk to maybe we can arrange a meet. 
 (V.O.) Where are you right now? 
 In my office. 
 (V.O.) I doubt that. If you were in your office-- 
 We'd be having this conversation face-to-face. 
 VOSEN (TAPE V.O.) Noah Vosen. 
 This is a code ten abort, I want everybody back in the vehicles this is a code ten abort! Back to the vehicles immediately, back to CRI immediately. 
 Bourne got into your safe! 
 What just happened? 
 Bourne got into Vosen's safe. 
 What?! 
 Where to? 
 415 East 71st Street. 
 4.15.71...     Jesus, Pam. 
 ...I want the entire building searched. Every room. Every hallway. Every closet. Every goddamm airduct. Do you understand? I want him found! 
 (to Tac Team Leader) Lethal force is authorized. 
 Tell them again! 
 Take him out! 
 Ho-ly shit! 
 (practically screaming into his handheld) He did what?! 
 (to Wills) Get NYPD backup! And FBI, DEA, any other federal assets we can draft! 
 10-13. Shots fired. Officer down. Port Authority parking lot. Level four. 
 BOURNE (CONT'D) Stay out of sight until one of your own arrive. 
 The asset lost Bourne.   We lost him. 
 Sir, this may be nothing but, look at Bourne's birthday. 
 What about it? 
 Well, Landy told Bourne his birthday was 4/15/71 so... 
 Everything stops. (to the room now) EVERYTHING STOPS! LISTEN UP! (they're listening) New assignment. Numbers. Four. (MORE) 
 Landy gave Bourne a false birthday. Wills thinks it's a code. 
 #3 -- if you plug them in as variants of latitude and longitude you get Cameroon -- Peru -- Colombia -- 
 #2 -- San Francisco's got a four-one- five area code -- 
 #1 -- 41571 is the zip code for Varney, Kentucky -- 
 #4 -- there's no 415 West 71st Street, but there is a 415 East 71st -- 
 #1 -- if it's a substitution code, we're way short on variables, which I -- (no chance to finish as-- ) 
 --hang on -- wait -- Seventy First Street? Like what? Like York and First? 
 #4 That's correct. 
 She gave him the facility.     She gave him-- 
 (into cell phone) I know. (to driver) Go! Go! Drive! (into cell phone) We're already on our way. Turn the teams around. Bring them in behind me. 
 
 Not long.    Get out of there. 
 No.   I'm going to stay. 
 Are you crazy, he'll-- 
 He'll come to the training wing. That's what he knows. I'll keep him in play until you arrive. 
 They'll kill you for giving me this place. 
 4/15/71 isn't much of a code. My guess is Vosen's already on his way. 
 Why'd you do it? 
 This isn't us, David. What they turned you into, what they're doing with Blackbriar... This has to stop. 
 Then stop it. Everything you need is in there. 
 David... Come in with me. It's better if we do this together. 
 (shakes head) This is where it started for me, this is where it ends. 
: 
 Oh, my God... 
 Landy! Right there!    She's got Bourne's backpack! 
 (to a group of six agents) I'll find Landy. You get to the training wing and get Bourne! 
 Do you know who I am? (the guard nods) Where's your security room? 
 I want to see all your footage for the last three minutes. 
 
 
 You better get a good lawyer. 
 Put the gun down. I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to talk. 
 I've spent three years running. Three years trying to find out who I was. 
 You still don't have it all back, do you? You haven't filled in all the pieces? 
 Let's start with the moment you found out I wouldn't execute Wombosi. The amnesia wasn't the issue, it was the fact that I didn't pull the trigger.... 
 One lapse meant your conditioning had failed. 
 It was always you, behind Conklin, behind Abbott.... They were just following orders. 
 (completely calm) I'm unarmed, Jason. 
 (shoving Hirsch hard against the wall) "David." I'm David Webb. 
 You were David Webb, but not anymore. 
 Why me?   Why did you pick me? 
 You really don't remember, do you? (beat) You picked us, Jason. 
 What does that mean? 
 You volunteered. 
 You volunteered right here.... You didn't even blink, Jason. You just handed me these... 
 HIRSCH (CONT'D) Has everything been explained to you. 
 Yes, sir. 
 You were a soldier ready to serve his country. Just like thousands of others, except you were a prodigy with languages...and a perfect shot. 
 HIRSCH (CONT'D) Your missions will save American lives. 
 You said I'd be saving American lives. Instead you just turned me into a killer. 
 You could have left at any time. And you knew exactly what it meant for you if you chose to stay. 
 When we're finished with you, you'll no longer be David Webb. 
 I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir. 
 Stop running from the truth, Jason. You chose to come here! You chose to stay! And no matter how much you want to forget it...eventually you're going to have to face how you chose, right there, to become Jason Bourne! 
 HIRSCH (CONT'D) You haven't slept for a long time have you David? Have you made a decision? This can't go on, you know. You have to decide. 
 Who is he? 
 We've been through that. 
 What did he do? 
 It doesn't matter. (beat) You came to us. You volunteered. You said you'd do anything it takes to save American lives. You're not a liar are you? Or too weak to see this through? This is it. Let go of David Webb. Will you give yourself to this program? 
 HIRSCH (CONT'D) You're no longer David Webb. From now on you'll be known as Jason Bourne. Welcome to the program. 
 He's ready. Send him to Operations. 
 Do you remember now? 
 I remember. I remember everything. 
 You can't outrun what you did, Jason. You made yourself into who you are. 
 I'm done running.  That's why I'm here. To end you, to shut this down. I'm no longer Jason Bourne. 
 So now you're going to kill me? 
 No. You don't deserve the star they give you on the wall at Langley. 
 Why didn't you take the shot? 
 Do you even know why you're trying to kill me? Look at what they make you give.

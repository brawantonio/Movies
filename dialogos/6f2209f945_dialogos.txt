 
 Fucking hot box. 
 Dirt over here tastes like dog shit. 
 I guess you'd know. 
 (keys mike) I got a military-aged male, on a cell phone, watching the convoy. Over. 
 GOAT (OC) He could be calling his old lady. 
 (keys mike) He stepped off. 
 (keys mike) Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out, moving toward the convoy. 
 Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying something. 
 She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian grenade. I think she gave it to the kid. 
 You got eyes on this? Can you confirm? 
 GOAT (OC) They fry you if you're wrong. Send your ass to Leavenworth. 
 MAN'S VOICE Get back here. 
 Don't ever leave your gun in the dirt. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Helluva shot, son. You got a gift. You're gonna make a fine hunter someday. 
 Everything dies to give life. 
 Can it see me? 
 It's a deer, son. 
 (hands him hunting knife) You shot it, you deal with it. 
 We don't see with his eyes so we don't know the glory of his plan. Our lives unfold before us like puzzling reflections in a mirror. But on the day we rise, we will see with clarity and understand the mystery of his ways-- 
 Some people prefer to believe that evil doesn't exist in the world, and if it ever darkened their doorstep they wouldn't know how to protect themselves... those are the sheep. 
 Now we're not raising any sheep in this family and I will whoop your ass if you turn into a wolf-- 
 Wayne-- 
 But we take care of our own. And if someone picks a fight with you or bullies your brother, you have my permission to finish it. 
 The guy was picking on Jeff. 
 That true? 
 (eye swollen) Yes sir... Yes, he was... (03.18.14)                         7. 
 (turns to Chris) And did you finish it? 
 Then you know who you are... 
 WAYNE (VO) You know your purpose. 
 "AMERICAN SNIPER" 
 Wasn't nobody there and you come away with a belt buckle too damn big to wear. What you supposed to do with it? (03.18.14)                          8. 
 (grabs belt buckle) You're supposed to get laid with it. I'm gonna wear it in and see if it puts Sarah in the mood. 
 A strong wind'd put Sarah in the mood. 
 Is that what they say? 
 You know what they called her in high school-- 
 Don't say it. 
 Sarah suck-a-- 
 Shit man-- 
 Who wants to hump a rodeo star? 
 What the fuck-- 
 You said you wasn't coming home until tomorrow. 
 (wounded) Why would you do this? 
 Just let him out. He didn't know... 
 (shamed, steps aside) You didn't know? 
 What the fuck is wrong with you! What'd you expect? You drag me out here then run off with your damn brother every weekend! 
 Get out. 
 You think you're a cowboy cause you rodeo? You're no cowboy. You're just a lousy ranch-hand and a shitty fuckin lay! 
 Some people ain't worth fighting for. 
 But she was right... 
 (closing his eyes) A job is a job. At least we're outside. (03.18.14)                         10. 
 Jeff, wake up. Look at this-- 
 Look what they did... 
 I saw what they did, on our soil, and-- 
 And you're from Texas and you're a patriot so it pissed you off. 
 Yes, sir. But I can't see myself on a ship. I'd wanna be in the fight-- 
 You wanna fight? Meet the warrior elite. 
 SEALs? 
 Sea, Air and Land. 
 I ain't much of a swimmer-- (03.18.14)                          11. 
 (taking brochure back) This isn't for the faint of heart. Most men wash-out. They quit-- 
 (cutting him off) I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit. 
 (sprays Chris in the face) You a quitter, boy? 
 No, sir! 
 Bullshit, you are fleet-meat. Don't turn away. Look up and take it. You're old as fuck. Did you join the Navy cause you had such a good time on Noah's Arc? How old are you? 
 30, sir. 
 30! You fart dust and could've fathered half these boys. You think cause you had a pop-gun back in Texas you're cut out to be a SEAL? 
 No, sir. 
 No, you're not cut out to be one? 
 What kind of asshole joins the Navy but hates the water. 
 I love water, hooyah. 
 My ass you do. 
 Is that you giggling you fat fuck? Look at you. You're so fat they had to baptize you at Sea World. Your momma fat too? 
 No sir, she's not. 
 Don't lie to me! I bet we could use her panties as a parachute. What the fuck are you doing here fatboy? Do your feet get wet when you shower? When's the last time you saw your pecker? You're not a Seal, you're a fuckin Walrus. A big giggling Walrus. "Biggles" that's your new name-- 
 --and that's your ticket home. Just drag your jelly-roll ass up and ring it and you'll be headed home to momma Shamu. 
 CHRIS (OC) (draws Rolle off Biggles) Two hundred. 
 (whirls around, hosing) Did I ask you to count? 
 No, sir. (03.18.14)                         13. 
 Was that your ass talking then? 
 That's a quitter. If he quits here, he'll quit in battle. When shit gets hairy he can't step up. You get shot, he can't pull you out. We're gonna weed out the quitters and see if we can find a warrior or two. 
 Wave goodbye to the sun, boys... 
 --and when I told her the condom broke she started crying and begging me to do something. And I'm a virgin, I don't know what to do, but I'd heard if you pour Coke up there you won't get pregnant-- (guys start laughing) So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods. She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring, she starts screaming, "it stings, it stings" but when I'd stop, she'd scream "no don't stop" and it's fizzing out and-- 
 INSTRUCTOR "TONY" You really from Connecticut, Dauber? I never met a hick from Hartford. 
 Country is countrywide, sir. 
 INSTRUCTOR "TONY" I don't think he likes black dudes, "D". 
 INSTRUCTOR "TONY" No? 
 INSTRUCTOR "TONY" You hungry Biggles? I'd bet you'd eat the ass out of a low-flying duck. 
 Hooyah. I'd toss that critter shitter on a baguette and get my eat on. 
 INSTRUCTOR "TONY" (screams in his face) Squirrel! Where'd you hide your nuts? 
 Nuts crawled up inside. The little shits are gone for good. 
 INSTRUCTOR "TONY" How about you old man? How you feeling? (03.18.14)                          15. 
 Dangerous, sir. Feeling dangerous. 
 I'm gonna try and get into sniper school. 
 Can you shoot? 
 I can hunt. And what's cooler than being a sniper? 
 Blowing shit up. Blowing shit up is way cooler. 
 (end of her rope) Will a drink make you 6 inches taller and charming? Will it make you not married? 
 I watched you take your ring off. Don't be a scumbag. Go home. 
 It could be the leather pants. 
 Yeah? What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone? 
 Corduroy. 
 Is that how it is with you guys-- suddenly single after three beers? 
 Only thing that happens to me after three beers is a fourth. 
 That's great. A real red-neck. 
 I'm no redneck, I'm a Texan. 
 What's the difference? 
 We ride horses, they ride their cousins. 
 (almost laughs) What do you do for work? You look like military. (03.18.14)                     17. 
 I polish dolphins. They have to be polished in captivity or their skin disintegrates. 
 Do I look stupid to you? 
 To be honest, you look a little sad. 
 So am I tall enough to buy you a drink? 
 Not until you tell me what you do. 
 How about this: one shot, one answer. 
 You're obviously military. What branch? 
 I'm just finishing BUD/S. 
 Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL? 
 That was two questions... 
 (two angry shots) I know all about you guys. My sister was engaged to a SEAL. 
 What's that mean you know all about us? 
 You're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and do whatever the fuck you want. (pushes him a shot) I'd never date a SEAL. (03.18.14)                   18. 
 (confused) How can you say we're self-centered? I'd lay down my life for my country. 
 Why? 
 Cause it's the greatest country on earth and I believe it's worth protecting. (climbs off stool) I'm sorry this guy hurt your sister but that's not me. Nice talking to you. 
 Where are you going? 
 You said you'd never date a SEAL, so I'm going home. 
 I said I'd never marry one. 
 Well in that case... what's your name? 
 Taya. 
 Nice to meet you, Taya. I'm Chris Kyle. 
 (liquor softening her) Pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all, isn't it Chris? 
 Our instructors say our biggest enemies are ego, liquor, and women. 
 Sounds like you're under attack. 
 --I'm not going home with you so don't even think about it. 
 Feel breath filling every cell of your body. This is our ritual. We master our breath, we master our mind--- 
 --pulling the trigger will become an unconscious effort. You will be aware of it but not directing it. And as you exhale, find your natural respiratory pause and the space between heart-beats. 
 CHRIS (OS) It's me again. The guy whose shoes you puked on? I was thinking maybe you didn't get my last message. Or the one before that. So, I figured-- (03.18.14)                        20. 
 You figured what? 
 Did you always want to be a soldier? 
 I wanted to be a cowboy-- but I did that and I felt like I was meant for more. 
 So you started rescuing girls from bars? 
 I rescued that bar from you. 
 Do you like country music? 
 Only when I'm depressed. 
 You want kids? (03.18.14)                          21. 
 Someday. My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men. 
 That's a shitty thing to tell a girl. 
 I've proven her right. 
 But those wrong picks put you here. They made you who you are. And I like who you are. 
 What happens when there's a real person on the other end of that gun? 
 (uncertain) I don't know... I just pray I can do my job if that day comes. 
 Mirage is boiling at 35 degree angle. 
 Check. I'm dialed for windage. 
 Hold right-four, up-two. 
 Are we looking at the same target? (03.18.14)                          22. 
 You're trembling... 
 I know. I don't... 
 We don't have to do this... 
 I want to. I do... 
 
 You need to shut your off-eye. 
 If I close my off-eye I can't see what's out there. 
 Negative. There's something-- 
 Give me 50 push-ups. Clear and safe. Push `em out. 
 There it is. 
 You hardly even know me. 
 I know enough. You're a package deal, babe. 
 What are you afraid of? 
 Nothing. Everything. I don't know. What if it doesn't work out? 
 I'm going to marry you, and we're going to start a family. 
 You got it all planned out, don't you. 
 I love you. I'm done. (03.18.14)                          24. 
 (crushed by his sincerity) Well... you're gonna need a ring if you want to talk all tough like that. 
 TAYA (OS) Oh my god! No! Chris-- 
 (her hand smudged with paint) What the hell is on your neck? 
 Would you believe me if I told you I was painted green and on an IV two hours ago? (03.18.14)                       25. 
 What do you-- 
 (smiles) Package deal babe. 
 (looks them over) It's on boys. Just got the call. 
 They say it'll be over in 6 weeks. 
 I'm so afraid. 
 Don't be afraid. It's all part of the plan. 
 Your heart is beating out of your chest. 
 (nods, looking past her) I'm not the only one going to war. 
 AQI have put a price on your heads and extremists from around the globe are flooding the borders to collect on it. 
 You snipers will be paired with a man to watch your back and inserted along the main road to do "overwatch" for 1st Marines going door to door. Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs. 
 The city was evacuated. Any military-aged male still here, is here to kill you. Let's bring these boys in safe and get our asses back home. Move-- 
 Keep your head down, Tex. The Muj' got snipers too. 
 A sniper won't aim for your head. 
 They got this sniper that's been hitting headshots from 500 yards out-- 
 WINSTON (CONT'D) --they call him "Mustafa." He was in the Olympics. 
 They got sniping in the Olympics now? 
 (trailing Chris) What're we looking for? 
 You ever hunt? 
 I ain't that kind of red-neck. 
 WINSTON (OS) Fuck, fuck-- 
 A 
 (laughing) You just got your first kill, Goat. 
 I'm going to the roof. You stay here and be on the lookout for farm animals. 
 (keys mike) I got a military-aged male, on a cell phone, watching the convoy. Over. (03.18.14)                          29. 
 (keys mike) He stepped off. 
 Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, moving toward the convoy. 
 Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying something. 
 She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian grenade. I think she gave it to the kid. 
 You got eyes on this? Can you confirm? Over. 
 GOAT (OC) They fry you if you're wrong. Send your ass to Leavenworth. (03.18.14)                       30. 
 GOAT (OC) -Fuck that was gnarly. 
 GOAT (OC) Shit yeah. Evil bitch! 
 You hear that? 
 Get the fuck off me. 
 That's your overwatch, Einstein. You can thank him later. Keep moving. 
 WASHROOM / MUSTAFA 
 
 #1 --hot as Bigfoot's ballsack over here. (knocks on next gate) Derka, derka, derka.... 
 CHRIS (OC) That was sniper fire. Shooter is on our side of Elizabeth street. Over. 
 
 
 Smells like piss in here. (no response) You covered our ass out there, man. Appreciate it. Those were ballsy shots. 
 And they were clean. Right? 
 Hell yeah, they were. 
 (finally looks up) That sniper walked right up our ass. 
 I chewed out our security detail. It won't happen again. 
 My shooter statements are on the dresser. 
 Six? 
 Should be eight. Two got dragged off. (off Marc) Something wrong? 
 No... but you got more kills than the rest of the snipers combined. 
 They still got one of our guys. (03.18.14)                          35. 
 You can't shoot what you can't see. 
 Heard you got your dick wet. 
 Where is everybody? 
 We're just picking our dicks here, training those fucking haji soldiers. 
 Why ain't you out there? 
 I got the shits. Marc Lee said you were on fuckin fire out there. 
 (shedding gear) You still read comic books? 
 It's a fuckin graphic novel. Talk to me, man. Did you pop your cherry? 
 This kid didn't even have hair on his balls and his mom hands him a grenade-- sends him running off to kill Marines. 
 (sees his hurt) You saw his balls? (03.18.14)                        36. 
 It was evil, man. That was hate like I've never seen it before. 
 That kid could've taken out ten Marines-- 
 (wrestling with it) I know. 
 You did your job. End of fuckin story. 
 It's just not how you imagine the first one going down. 
 How about the other ones? What about the other kills? 
 The other ones-- were righteous. Like God was blowing on my bullets. 
 
 
 Our task here is to make sure every kill is a righteous kill and conforms to ROEs. 
 By every kill, do you mean just our kills or you're monitoring the bad guys too? (03.18.14)                       37. 
 #2 Your scores at sniper school were average at best, then you get here and you're just lighting the world on fire? 
 Sorry, was that a question? 
 
 Haven't seen shit all day. Maybe the war is over and they forgot to tell us. 
 (keys mike) I got a armed military-aged male moving tactically with a car battery. Maybe he needs a jump? 
 His wife said he was carrying a Koran. 
 Well, I don't know what a Koran looks like but I can describe what he was carrying-- it was pressed metal, fired 7.62s and looked just like an AK-47. 
 (03.18.14)                          38. 
 Listen up ladies and genitals. The Legend here would like you to know that when it comes to sniping it's better to be lucky than good! Our boy here has a Texas horseshoe crammed so far up his ass that-- 
 TAYA (OS) Have you killed anyone yet? 
 That's not how the call-home goes, babe. 
 TAYA (OS) Don't be weird with me. Seriously. I want you to tell me everything. 
 There are things we can't say over the phone. 
 (playful) You knocked me up and now I'm stuck here by myself assembling baby-cribs and you can't talk to me? That's the big plan? 
 You guys almost done over there yet? (03.18.14)                        39. 
 I can't stop thinking about that pink silky thing you wore on our honeymoon... 
 It's called a nightgown. 
 Yeah-- 
 And three days is not a honeymoon. 
 It was a good three days. I miss you bad. 
 (curls up in chair) You want me to talk dirty to you? 
 Yeah. But I got my gun in one hand and the phone in the other-- 
 Well, you'll just have to decide what's more important. 
 You're horny preggers. 
 Fat and horny. It's kinda disgusting. 
 You could be 300 pounds I'd still do you. 
 -So romantic. 
 How's my boy? 
 Nobody said it's a boy-- 
 I can't wait to see the way you are with him. You're gonna be incredible. (03.18.14)                         40. 
 (harbors doubt) How do you know? 
 I just know. I can see it. 
 I hope you're right. 
 (suddenly) Did your dad get hold of you? 
 I haven't checked any email. 
 Shit. You need to call him. Hang up and-- 
 What happened? 
 I'm so selfish. I wasn't even thinking-- 
 Taya. 
 Your little brother deployed. 
 What happened to jump school? I thought-- 
 He didn't get in. Just call your dad-- 
 Deployed where? Where's he going? 
 Over there. He's headed to Iraq. 
: (03.18.14)                         41. 
 COL. GRONSKI His name is "Zarqawi" and he is the prince of al-Qaeda in Iraq. AQI, his mercenary army, are 5000 strong. They're trained well, paid well and waging the heaviest urban combat since Vietnam. 
 COL. GRONSKI Zarqawi and his Lieutenants are our highest priority. Only way to root them out is to go house-to-house until we find them, or someone who will reveal their whereabouts. We need to clear ten structures an hour. It's aggressive so we'll loosen things up with air support-- 
 These Marines rush in like they been doing, they'll get their asses shot off. 
 They're Marines. They don't get the training we do. Half of them were civilians six months ago. 
 So let's coach them up. I'll show them how Team Guys do it and lead a unit in the street. 
 Can't do. We need you on overwatch. 
 But if I was down in the street-- 
 House-to-house is the deadliest job here. You got some kind of savior complex? 
 I just wanna get the bad guys. And I can't shoot them if I can't see `em. 
 You got a hot hand. These Marines all know your name now and they think they're invincible with you up there. 
 They're not-- 
 They are if they believe they are. Just keep banging on the long-gun and let these ground-pounders sniff out Zarqawi. 
 You said that AQI sniper was in the Olympics-- but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter in the last three games. 
 Mustafa's not Iraqi. He's from Syria. (03.18.14)                       43. 
 (keys mike) Once you make entry I can't see shit, so keep it slow and push through the target. 
 Fuck this-- I'm going down to clear houses with the Marines. You coming? 
 No man. No. I like my life. I wanna make it home. I go fishing and do all kind of cool shit. It's not my job to knock down doors. Those guys picked the wrong fucking job. I ain't doing that shit. 
 (smiles) If I don't see you down there, you make sure I don't see you again. 
 (bowls up) You wanna be a sniper? Swap me guns. 
 "JEFF" MARINE Really? 
 I'll roll with you guys if that's cool? 
 CPT. GILLESPIE Hey, any Navy Seal is cool by me. 
 You're that guy. They're calling you The Legend. You got like 24 confirmed kills. 
 It's 32. But who's counting. 
 That's badass. 
 There's some boy in Bravo catching up. 
 (packs a dip) Y'all are meateaters for sure but I got a little training I could show you, some simple shit, that might just keep us above ground. What do you say? 
 (low) -Whas that mean again? 
 Cover and follow. 
 Down. Down! On the floor, now! 
 I will fucking shoot you! Down! Get down-- 
 He does look a little retarded. 
 You were ordered to evacuate. Why are you still here? 
 I found these bitches in the back closet. 
 This sand nig' want us in here so he can blow us up. Check his ass for a vest. 
 Who will know we've spoken? (03.18.14)                          46. 
 Bring the other guys in. 
 Who is he? I need a name. 
 He calls him - the pure flame of fire- . Basically, this man comes to their house and prey on the weak with hurt. 
 So he's some kind of enforcer? 
 (jumps) We want Zarqawi. Where do we find Zarqawi? 
 How do we find him? 
 He will ask for money. 
 We don't even have proof this guy exists. 
 I'm sorry. I want to help you. I do. But I need names, places, phone numbers-- 
 (rushes in) Hey, we got a Marine unit pinned down in a house just uprange-- 
 Give me a name, Sheik. Give me something. 
 They're out of ammo. If we don't go now-- 
: 
 I guess that translates to "pay me" in just about any language, doesn't it? 
 Yes sir, it does. 
 And you're the secret squirrel with the cash, right? 
 (not amused) When you were having tea with Sheik al- Obedie did he tell you he ran a network of highway bandits before AQI moved in? 
 He left that part out. 
 That's AQI's racket now. Your Sheik got edged out. This could be blowback. 
 Or he could be upset The Butcher cut off his wife's hand. Either way, seems like you'd wanna explore it. 
 This is your guy here. (points to photo directly under Zarqawi) We believe The Butcher is Zarqawi's number two man. 
 But you don't know his real name or you'd have it written up there. (03.18.14)                          49. 
 We have several aliases-- (picks up phone, dialing) If "Fanus" is legit we go see the Sheik. 
 He's asking for 100,000. 
 If he delivers the Butcher he'll get it. (into phone) This is Agent Shead, DIA, I need a name check on "Amir Khalaf Fanus." I'll wait. 
 If we're going back out, TEAM 3 could pull security-- 
 If we're humping money the head-shed will want contractors on it. (into phone) I'm here. What do you got? 
 Road-kill. 
 The Butcher is Zarqawi's enforcer. They say his weapon of choice is a drill. 
 I went to seminary school before I joined the Navy. Came close to being a preacher. 
 Why didn't you? (03.18.14)                       50. 
 I love to gamble, man. Love those dice. 
 My kind of preacher. 
 It's like that now, huh? 
 You haven't heard? I'm The Legend. (laughs at self; into phone) Hey babe-- 
 TAYA (OS) You were right, doctor says it's a boy. 
 It's a boy! 
 Hell yeah. Congratu-- 
 Chris!-- 
 I heard one shot. 
 Check. Large caliber. Came in at an angle, gotta be 300 or more out-- (03.18.14)                       51. 
 (ducks back) He's all over us. You get a bead? 
 Negative-- 
 Minaret, 11 o'clock! 
 (from Humvee) There's no room. We'll come back for you-- 
 You got eyes on that? 
 Negative. 
 Eyes on The Butcher. He's got that Sheikh's kid in the street-- 
 Fuck!-- 
 (into radio) --requesting back-up. We're pinned down taking sniper fire on approach of high- value target, GRID 04536236. Over. 
 We're on the wrong end of this. 
 I'm gonna pop smoke for cover but don't move till I say. 
 Hold. 
 We gotta go-- 
 Holding! Hold... 
 Move now. Go-- 
 How you know he'd wait-- (03.18.14)                        53. 
 Cause I'd wait. 
 (sobbing, into phone) Chris-- 
 
 Go around. I'll go high. 
 
 
 
 
 He had line-of-sight 500 meters out. 
 Colonel Gronski is all over Marc, bro. (03.18.14)                          55. 
 We need to work up a squad to pursue him. 
 They're shutting us down. 
 What do you mean? 
 We're confined to base pending an incident review. 
 Can he do that? Just shelf us like that? I ship home in three weeks. 
 It's gonna be a long three weeks. 
 I thought you were dead. I thought-- 
 Shh. I'm know. I'm so sorry. 
 You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. 
 I have an alien growing inside me-- 
 And there's a strange man in my bedroom. 
 Our bedroom. 
 (pulls his ring off necklace) Why isn't it on your finger? 
 If it catches the light... 
 Your hands feel different. 
 They're mine. I swear... 
 Why am I so fucking nervous? 
 (kissing her belly) I'm nervous too. 
 No you're not. Don't lie. 
 I am... What if that little alien reaches out and grabs me? 
 Why are you so good with me. 
 TAYA (OC) --it might be nice to get out-- 
 TAYA (OC) --are you listening to me? Chris-- 
 (knee pumping) Huh?-- 
 What do you want to do today, hon'? 
 Maybe we just relax here? 
 Okay, we do that. Let's relax. 
 How you feeling? 
 I'm done being pregnant. I want to meet him. 
 It'll be any day now. (03.18.14)                       58. 
 How about you Mr. Kyle? How're you feeling? 
 Good. Doing good. 
 I imagine you're still decompressing. 
 Not really. 
 Well, this is the first time we left the house. 
 I'm just happy to be home. 
 Here, slip this on for me. 
 If you wanna help, you should be looking at my knees. I don't know what I did but-- 
 Are you a smoker? 
 No, ma'am. 
 Do you drink? 
 (charming) Only when I'm thirsty. 
 170 over 110. 
 (concerned) Jesus Christ Chris... (03.18.14)                        59. 
 Is that high? 
 Not if you just had 14 cups of coffee. But for someone who is sitting down-- 
 I'll look into it. Thanks doc. 
 You sabotaged me back there. 
 What am I supposed to do. You're not talking. You act like it's all okay-- 
 It is okay. I'm fine. 
 You're not fine. Your blood pressure-- 
 Babe, I'm driving down the freeway, it's sunny and 72 degrees. I'm fine. But there are people dying over there and I look around and it's like it's not even happening. It's barely on the news, no one talks about it. No one cares. And if I stay too long I'll forget about it too. 
 Chris-- 
 We're at war and I'm headed to the mall. 
 I don't belong here. I can't help anybody- 
 --it's happening-- (03.18.14)                          60. 
 Oh shit-- 
 What're you doing! 
 I'm going back. 
 (laughing and crying) --oh my god, you're crazy! You're fucking crazy you know that? 
: 
 My little man... 
 Look at our boy. Look what we did. (nuzzles close to her) I love you, baby. We made it-- 
 TAYA (OC) The baby is crying. I thought you were-- 
 Don't bother turning it off, I already watched it. 
 I had to make sure you didn't have an Iraqi girlfriend sending sexy videos. 
 This sniper is recording his kills. Mustafa. They sell these in the street. 
 That day we were on the phone-- 
 You're not protecting me by not talking about it. 
 I don't want you thinking about it. I don't need you worrying. 
 My imagination is so much worse than anything you could tell me-- 
 (cutting her off) No, it's not. They're savages. 
 Chris-- 
 They're fuckin savages. 
 It's not about them, it's about us. (hands him baby) You have to make it back to us. 
 "SECOND TOUR" 
 Slower than Christmas. 
 Can you give me a second--? 
 Hey, grunt-- 
 Chris? 
 Y'alright? You in one piece? 
 Let's go, PFC Kyle. Move your ass. 
 You okay? Jeff?-- 
 I heard you're kickin ass our here. All the guys, that's what they say-- 
 You're my hero, bro. Always have been. 
 (swollen with emotion) The Legend... 
 (over deafening noise) I'm gonna miss my ride. 
 What happened? 
 I'm just tired, man. I'm-- (swallows it) I'm going home. 
 I'm proud of you. You hear me? 
 Dad too. He's proud of you. 
 Fuck this place-- (03.18.14)                         64. 
 (can't hear him) What? 
 Fuck this place. 
 COL. JONES You made Chief. Congratulations. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 COL. JONES Gronski's gone. A lot of top-brass are. We're working off a new playbook now. 
 COL. JONES I've studied insurgencies for the last decade. I know every stone thrown since before the first century. These wars are won and lost in the minds of our enemy. 
 COL. JONES That you? 
 COL. JONES You're now the most wanted man in Iraq. 
 Don't tell my wife, she might take that number right about now. 
 COL. JONES I understand you wanted to put together a direct-action squad to hunt The Butcher. (03.18.14)                        65. 
 Yes, sir. 
 COL. JONES We plugged the rat-hole that is Fallujah and flushed them into Ramadi. We got some intel indicating his area of operations. 
 COL. JONES I want you to put the fear of God in these savages, and find his ass. 
 You guys know how I hate this shit so shut your traps. Our target is Amir Khalaf Fanus aka The Butcher. (clicks first slide) We'll be heading in under cover of darkness, sector P13, north of the river-- 
 You give good power-point, Legend. 
 Is this thing bulletproof? (holds Chris' Bible) You never open it so I assumed... 
 God, country, family, right? (03.18.14)                       66. 
 You got a God? 
 You getting weird on me? 
 We had this electric fence around our property in Oregon and us kids used to see who could grab it and hang on the longest. War feels like that, it puts lightning in your bones, makes it hard to hold on to anything else. 
 You need to sit this one out? 
 I just wanna believe in what we're doing-- 
 Evil lives here, we've seen it. 
 It lives everywhere-- 
 You want to invite these motherfuckers to come fight in San Diego? Or New York? We're protecting more than this dirt. 
 Hooyah then. Lets go kill this fucker. 
 (whisper-mic, pointing) This building, any apartment on the east side, will look down Fahima Halal. 
 (whisper-mic) Breacher-up. 
 Tell em they won't be leaving till we do-- (hands Terp a photo) Ask if they seen him. 
 (Hall & Oates song) --Private eyes, we're watching you, watching your every move... 
 Big freezers. 
 Let's keep eyes on it get pictures of anyone coming and going. 
 Fucking Chief Nappy-nap. 
 What do we got? 
 16 military aged males have gone in. 
 Sixteen? 
 They serve more customers than McDonalds. 
 And check this. 
 He still inside? 
 I'm only clocking one point of entry. He's in there, but it's no easy breach. 
 When they see it's The Legend they'll probably just invite him in-- (03.18.14)                        69. 
 You got a problem? I didn't promote myself. 
 No, I did it for you. You'd never have made Chief if I nicknamed you "The Myth". 
 Enough. It's everybody's Navy. 
 --naw, it's Legend's Navy now. Just hope he leaves some for the rest of us. 
 Hash out tactics. We go at zero-dark. And Big Giggles is making the coffee. 
 (translates) He invites you to join him for Eid al- Adha supper. He says -on this day everyone has a seat at my table-. 
 Tell him that's very generous of him. 
 Tell him he's gonna be shipped off for detention and the Iraqi courts can decide what to do with him-- or he can help us get inside that restaurant down there. 
 That's a bad move-- 
 He's our breech. He's a fucking way in-- 
 If something happens-- 
 He's AQI man, look what he's holding. 
 It's his choice. Tell him. 
 "D" (VO) Approaching the door... 
 
 "D" (VO) 5 meters... 
 
 "D" (VO) He's knocking... 
 "D" (VO) They're vetting him. 
 GUARD'S POV 
 (N/V) 
 "D" (OS) Now. 
 (keys mike) We have eyes on the target. Flushing them out the back-- 
 (keys mike) Negative. Nothing yet. 
 
 
 (to "D") Help him-- 
 (realizes; keys mike) They're coming back up! Watch your six-- 
 
 --I can't hear you. Say again. 
 
 Move. 
 
 Biggles! Watch your six. Roadies on you-- 
 
 Pull back! Loading-- 
 Got you. 
 
! 
 Contact. Eyes on The Butcher. 12 o'clock. 
 (keys mike) Dauber? You got visual? Confirm. (03.18.14)                          74. 
 
 Negative. No shot-- 
 
 He's on the move. Crossing! 
 Got you. Got you. Go, go, go-- 
 
 (can't take eyes off son) I offered his father detention. I gave him a choice-- 
 Sir, we have armed insurgents moving this way. We need to make tracks. 
 Tell him this boy's father was fighting for the people that butchered the clerics we found in the freezer in there. 
 
 - This is our territory. If you want to come here, you ask me. If you want to find someone, I find them- (03.18.14)                          76. 
 BIGGLES (OC) (atop Humvee, on the .60) Fuck `em. Let's go. Shit's getting hairy. 
 (to Tribal Leader) If I ask for your help you're the one they carve up next. I've seen it happen. 
 
 -I am the seventh son of Isaac of Abraham. This is the land of my father, and I am not afraid.- He says your evil is greater than those you fight. He calls you white satan, devil of Ramadi. 
 
 You tell him to deliver The Butcher to us, or the devil comes back. 
 TAYA (VO) The news is saying the war is over. 
 CHRIS (VO) It's not over. 
 TAYA (VO) But are we winning? 
 CHRIS (VO) I don't know... 
 Hey, some help here-- She's crying-- 
: 
 But I want that one-- (03.18.14)                         78. 
 (the air still thick, his words spoken from afar) You don't get to choose, bubba. 
 But I don't like it! I want that one-- 
 You get what it gives you. That's how this thing works. 
 Don't do this. Get up. Come on-- 
 RECEPTIONIST (OC) Chris Kyle, your truck is ready. 
 (snaps-to; to Colton) Get off the floor. Right now-- 
 Are you... "Chief" Chris Kyle? 
 That's me. 
 Sorry to intrude, sir, but we met in Fallujah. You saved my life. 
 Did I--? 
 (lifetimes ago, but) Yeah. Right. Well, you Marines saved our ass plenty out there. How you holding up? 
 It cost lots of guys more than a leg. 
 Did you lose some friends? 
 That too, but I'm talking about guys that lived. They made it back but they're just not back. They can't seem to get right. 
 Yeah, I-- I'm sorry to hear that. 
 You should come down to the VA sometime. The guys would love it. They all know who The Legend is. 
 I bet you missed your daddy when he was gone. But can I tell you something? Your dad is a hero. He saved my life-- (eyes well up) He helped me get home to my little girl. 
 So thank you for loaning him to us, li'l man. I wouldn't be here without him. 
 My family thanks you for your service. 
 I'm making memories by myself. I have no one to share them with. 
 We have the rest of our lives for that. 
 When does that start? Even when you're here you're not here. 
 I hate the teams for it. I do. You're my husband and the father of my children-- but they're the ones that pull you back. 
 (doesn't look up from his daughter) We can wait. They can't. 
 TAYA (OC) If you think this war isn't changing you you're wrong. 
 You can only circle the flame so long. 
 "THIRD TOUR" 
 (keys mike) --we are tailing the Butcher's courier, turning onto Maryland Street. Over. 
 I bought the ring. 
 Here? 
 They're cheaper here. 
 You want some savage's ring? What if it's a blood diamond? 
 What the fuck do you care? You spilled more blood than anyone! 
 Not for a rock. 
 Whatever, man. 
 Ease off, don't get too close. (the van turns ahead) You gonna tell her where it came from? 
 Hell no! I'll tell her I got from Zales. 
 BIGGLES (OS) (over radio) Still with us cookie? (03.18.14)                          82. 
 20 years from now, we'll have a reunion and you'll be married to a dude. 
 
 The Butcher has his peepers out. 
 This motherfucker is Keyser Söze. Next time you got a shot try not to miss. 
 I coulda taken him in that alley if I didn't have to save your ass-- 
 (accelerates) Whatever helps you sleep at night. 
 ON A ROOFTOP 
 
 You gonna be my best man? 
 (still masked) Is it just me? Or other guys too? 
 You fucking egomaniac-- 
 Rooftop, twelve-o'clock-- 
 Get me a shot, grandma. 
 A 
 That should do it. 
 What the fuck!? How'd he survive-- 
 Rubber junk-man's got your horseshoe. 
 Clear. 
 (keys mike) We're headed to the roof. Secure the van. 
 No ammo, no jihad. 
 
 How the hell'd he make that? 
 He didn't-- 
 So much for leading us to the Butcher. 
 So much for him having my horseshoe. (03.18.14)                         85. 
 
 She'll take it to Zales and try to find out how much your spent. 
 She's not like that. 
 They're all like that. 
 It's giant, bro. Four karats. It had to belong to one of Saddam's bitches-- 
 A 
 No!-- 
 (dives on him, keys mike) Biggles is down. Man down. (pulls Biggles close, chiseled with grief) No, buddy. No! Stay with me-- (03.18.14)                        86. 
 (keys mike) Cover! I need cover. He's picking us off. 
 (gargled) I'm got it. I got it-- I can walk-- 
 (gargling blood) --I'm sorry-- 
 You got nothing to be sorry for. I shouldn't have had us up there-- 
 Am I gonna die? 
 We'll rub a little dirt in it, get you a sip of water, you'll be fine. 
 --it was always gonna be me-- 
 Coulda been any of us. Just hang on-- (03.18.14)                          87. 
 Not you. Not the Legend. You lucky fuck-- 
 Don't die, Ryan. You hold on-- 
 He was 1000 meters out. Only one enemy sniper makes that shot. 
 COL. JONES Will he make it? 
 Doesn't look good, Master Chief. 
 COL. JONES A Shi'a cab driver we source is saying there's a stronghold seven doors down. 
 COL. JONES I can understand if you want to stand- down and regroup. It's up to you. 
 Lex talionis... (looks up) Eye for eye, tooth for tooth. 
 We're going back. 
 Two clicks out. Lock and load. 
 For Biggles. 
 Courtyard is clear. Moving. 
 Some stronghold. Move. 
 
 
 
 Clear. 
 
 Somebody left in a hurry. 
 (keys mike) You sure we got the right address-- 
 DAUBER (OS) (from hallway) Fuck-- 
 
 Contact-- 
 Marc-- 
: 
 Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago. Did he say any of that to you? 
 Chris? I want to know what you thought of his letter... 
 (slow, absent) An AQI informant called in a tip. Biggles had just been shot. We were operating off emotion and-- we walked into an ambush. 
 But that's not what killed him. That letter did. That letter killed Marc. (looks to her) He let go and he paid the price for it. (03.18.14)                         92. 
 If something ever happened to me-- you'd meet someone else. You'd be alright. 
 Do you want to die? Is that what it is? 
 No. 
 (cheeks shine with tears) Then tell me why do you do it. I want to understand. 
 I do it for you. To protect you. 
 No you don't. I'm here. Your family is here. Your children have no father-- 
 Without this, there's nothing. 
 Bullshit. It's not about us anymore. You don't know when to quit. It's over- (violent) You did your part! We sacrificed enough. Let somebody else go-- 
 I could never live with myself. 
 You find a way! You have to. I need you to be human again. I need you here. (no response, she calms) If you leave again, we might not be here when you get back. 
 I know. 
 (enters) Hey, buddy-- 
 Chris? Where are you? 
 I'm right here just give me a minute-- (hobbles around the bed) Just blind as a bat, huh? 
 Yeah... It fucking blows. They're gonna fix my face though. 
 That's good. Your face always needed a little fixing. 
 I heard you proposed? Did you tell Kelly the diamond was from Zales? 
 Naw, I bought a new one. A small one. Her dad helped me out. 
 Nice. 
 She wouldn't leave me, bro. I told her to go-- but she wouldn't leave. (MORE) (03.18.14)                    94. 
 BIGGLES (CONT'D) (voice cracking) She's getting a raw fucking deal. 
 No she's not. How can you say that? She's getting you. (eyes welling up) All four inches. 
 I'm glad this happened to me and not you. No way you could've handled it. 
 You're probably right. 
 They say you're the deadliest sniper in U.S. Military history. 
 Is that what they say? 
 The bad guys fled up into to Sadr City. 
 You're not going back? 
 We're gonna wall `em in and hunt `em down. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 Yes I do. You're my brother and they're going to pay for what they did to you. 
 Hooyah, Legend. Hooyah-- 
. The Legend, right? I heard you killed 101 men your last tour. The hajis call you The Devil of Ramadi. 
. So how many kills you got now? 
 You have to ask the Navy. I lost count. 
 "FOURTH TOUR" 
 Any other Punishers here? 
 (nostalgic) Teams and shit. 
 I know. I visited him before I left. That fucker can't see shit. 
 I love you too. 
 A 
 CHRIS (OC) Don't do it-- 
 CHRIS (OC) --please God-- 
 
 CHRIS (OC) How deep? 
 Is it Mustafa? 
 Moo-who? 
 In the middle of a fucking sandstorm? 
 What was that-- 
 
 
 Step away from the car! 
 #2 (FIRES WARNING SHOT) --move for the trunk you will be shot. 
 
 (in Arabic) Tell the devil we found his Butcher. We will protect ourselves now. 
 
 
 T-WALL 
 
 No-- (keys mike) It came from behind us. We went the wrong way. He's south of the wall. 
 CHRIS (OC) (into mike) I got something. 1900 yards out. 
 "D" (OS) He's right, Legend. No bueno. 
 CHRIS (OC) Correction. 2100 yards out. 
 CHRIS (OC) (beat) It's him. 
 CHRIS (OS) (over radio) This is Charlie 7 Bravo. We have eyes on the target. Initiate QRF. Over. 
 "D" (OS) Can you confirm it's him. 
 
 CHRIS (OS) He has eyes on our guys. 
 "D" (OS) If you got it, take it. 
 CHRIS (OC) Aim small. Aim small. 
 For Biggles. 
 Tango down. 
 
 You just fucked us, Legend-- (screams into mike) We need Stryker and QRF units, ASAP. 
 He was on our boys and I took him out. 
 We are fucked like a football bat. 
 (03.18.14)                        104. 
 There are two ways onto the roof. We cover both stairways and conserve ammo. 
 Conserve-- 
 
 (into mike) Negative, negative, danger-close, they're all over us-- 
 (screams) QRF is stuck three blocks out. 
 I'm out of ammo-- (03.18.14)                        105. 
 I don't wanna get dragged in the street-- 
 Do it. Call in our coordinates. 
 (keys mike) This is Rio Two Bravo, requesting ordinance drop. GRID 04837959. (gunfire) I know my fucking position! They're right on top of us. Drop it! 
 White-side! 
: 
 3-4, copy that. 30 seconds out. (03.18.14)                        106. 
 --you got four rounds. 
 TAYA (OS) Hello? 
 Hello? 
 (struggles) Hey baby-- 
 Chris-- What's the noise? 
 I can't hear you-- 
 I'm ready to come home. I'm ready... 
 What's happening-- 
 --I'm coming home. Can you hear me? 
 Chris-- 
 F-18 
 
 Go, go, let's move-- 
 
 (choking, into mike) Stryker-3, what's your location-- 
 Hold there! We are 30 seconds out-- (pointing ahead) Go. Straight ahead. Go-- 
 BDUs-- That's them! Drop the ramp. 
 I don't see him-- 
 (into phone) --hello? 
 TAYA (OS) Where are you? I got a weird message that you were on a plane? 
 (into phone) Yeah, I got out early. 
 TAYA (OS) So are you in Germany, or-- 
 I'm here, I'm stateside. 
 TAYA (OS) You're home? What are you doing? 
 (looks around for answer) I guess I just needed a minute. 
 TAYA (OS) Chris, the kids are dying to see you. It's been nine months. 
 Yeah, I know... Me too. I'm coming. 
 TAYA (OS) (pause) Are you alright? 
 Yeah. I'm good. 
 TAYA (OS) Then come home. We miss you. 
 Okay. 
 Chris...? 
 --his game is Saturdays. He's the tallest kid on the team. The doctor said he could be six-four. I can't wait for you to see him play. Maybe you could even coach? 
 McKenna's about to lose that tooth and I'm worried she's going to swallow it. She said she'd let you pull it. But only you. 
 BOY'S MOM Get him off! Get away-- 
 TAYA (OC) No! He's a puppy. He doesn't know! 
 Maybe you saw things, or did some things over there that you wish you hadn't-- 
 That's not me. 
 What's not you? 
 I was just protecting my guys. They were trying to kill our soldiers and-- I'm willing to stand before my creator and answer for every shot I took. (struggles) The thing that haunts me are all the guys I couldn't save. 
 You want to save more guys, walk down any hall in this hospital. We got plenty soldiers that need saving. (pulls prescription pad) I'm going to recommend Zoloft and-- 
 How's it feel? 
 Feels like The Legend is trying to fuck up my shot. Stay still, man. 
 Bulls-eye, boy! Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back. (03.18.14)                         113. 
 Why you spend all this time with us? I know you got a family. 
 I heard you had a nice boot collection before the war and-- 
 (laughs) Seriously man. Why do you do it. 
 We gotta take care of our own. 
 
 Get `em up, lil' lady. Hands in the air. 
 Can I tell you something. 
 Tell it to the judge. 
 I'm proud of you and I don't say it enough. I feel blessed. You're an incredible father and-- I feel lucky to have my husband back. 
 We could lock the doors. They can't get out of the yard. 
 I know how hard you fought to get here. (03.18.14)                    115. 
 You're worth fighting for. 
 Did you pleat those jeans? 
 Yes, ma'am. Right up the middle. 
 Well, you're just a regular old cowboy again, aren't you? 
 I meant what I said about locking the doors. 
 Aren't you and Chad going to the range? 
 (checks watch) Not for four minutes. 
 Is that all it takes. 
 It'll take half that. Then I got two minutes leftover just to look at you. 
 Who are you taking out? 
 This Marine. His mom does parking at school and she asked for my help. 
 Well don't be late for dinner. 
 Dad, you want to play Skylander? Please-- (03.18.14)                         116. 
 I gotta go do something but when I get back, okay? But you have to let me win. 
 No way. 
 Poke the bear-- 
 No. You're supposed to roar. Like Grrr. 
 I should get going... 
 Look after our women, Bubba. (turns to Taya) Love you, babe.

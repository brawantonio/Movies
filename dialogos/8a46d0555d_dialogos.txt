 Hey... 
 Hey... 
 I'm sorry... It's alright, I'm not gonna hurt you. 
 What do you want? 
 I thought you were... 
 What? 
 I don't know... 
 
! 
 It's ok, come here. 
 It's ok, calm down, evrything's gonna be fine. 
 What was in there? 
 Just give me a minute to figure things out. 
 Why are you afraid of that room? 
 Just give me a minute I said. 
 How many people are in this thing? Listen! We can't go climbing around in here. 
 Why not? 
 There's traps. 
 What do you mean, traps? 
 Ubitraps. I looked into a room down there and something almost cut my 
 Holy God, holy, holy God! 
 Are you alright? Mister? Worth? 
 Alright? 
 I hit my head? 
 Let me take a look at that. It's ok, I'm a doctor, it doesn't look bad. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Hey old man? 
 Motiondetectors integrated in the walls. Tough to spot. 
 Wait a second! Let's all just relax for a minute. Does anybody remember 
 Perogies! I was eating dinner. Perogies, cheese and potato. I ran out of 
 You... Leaven? 
 What about you? 
 I just woke up here. 
 Middle of the night. It's like Chile. They always come in the middle of the night. 
 Only the government can build something this ugly. 
 Oh, it ain't government. 
 Then what is it. 
 I don't know. 
 Aliens! 
 Please, we're spooked anough as it is. Let's rule out aliens from now on 
 Rennes... 
 What do you think Rennes? 
 We don't solve the act, sitting still. I'm moving at this straight line, 
 Alright, I attend to agree. 
 No one is gonna come. 
 There's a way in here, so there's gotta be a way out. We can avoid the 
 Ok. 
 It can't be that simple. 
 It ain't gonna be that simple. Take a look around. Take a good long look around, see it. Coz, I got a feeling it's looking at us. 
 Leaven, we can do this. We just have to stay calm, and work together as a team. There's gotta be a lot of people looking for us on the outside. I'm a cop, alright? 
 Yeah... I'm gonna get you out of here, I promise, but you gotta be with me on this one... 
 Boot it! 
 Clean. 
 That one sounded closer. 
 It's mechanical. Seems to come at regular intervals. 
 Maybe it's the ventilationsystem? 
 No bets... 
 No kidding, I'm boiling 
 What is it, serial numbers? 
 Room numbers, they're different in each room. 
 Oh great, so there's only 566 million 400.000 rooms in this thing. 
 There'd better not be! We have about three days without food and water before we're too weak to move. 
 Holloway! 
 Oh, we have heat, stress, physical exhaustion i.e. dehydration, headaches, dizziness, disorientation, confusement. Mental process. The body eventual begins to break down it's own tissue. 
 Suck on it... Keeps the saliva flowing. 
 What? 
 The air seems dry in there. 
 Trapped? 
 Molecular chemical sensor. 
 Why the hell didn't the boot set it off. 
 The boot's not alive. It detects hydrogen-sulfide extruded from the skin. 
 How come, you know so much about sensors, Renz? 
 Rennes... Not Renz! It's french! 
 Fine, you're french. I'm asking how... 
 Rennes... Sensorexpert... With the right age... I don't believe it... 
 This guy is The Wren... 
 The what? 
 The Wren. The bird of Attica. through the coop on six major prisons. 
 Seven! 
 You're kidding right? 
 Maybe. 
 An escapeartist! 
 Yes, I'm Harry "fucking" Houdini. The only reason I dragged you so far, is cause I need your boots. If you're not smarting up I'm gone like that. No more talking... No more guessing. Don't even think about something which is not right in front of ya. That's the real challenge, you gotta save yourselves from yourselves. 
 Merde. 
 Get him out! 
 So it was electrochemical or whatever, right? And he missed it. The Wren... That's great, that's fucking great. 
 Alright... It's time to reassess this place. 
 I've been over it again and again, why would they throw innocent people in here? Are we being punished? 
 Forget about all that! You can't see the big picture from in here. So don't try. Keep your head down. Keep it simple. Just look, look at what's in front of you. 
 That's what he said. 
 Start with us. We got an escapeartist and a cop. There's gotta be a reason for that. You're a doctor Holloway. That gives you a function, a reason, right? 
 No, it just makes me go: "Why me, and not one of the ten million other doctors out there"! 
 Leaven. What are you? 
 What else? 
 I think we have to ask the big questions: What does it want? What is it 
 One down, four to go. 
 Why don't you tell us what your purpose is Worth! 
 I've wondered that myself. I'm just a guy, I work in an officebuilding, doing officebulding stuff. I wasn't actually bursting joie de vivre before I got here. Life just sucks in general. 
 I can't stand that attitude. 
 What´s your purpose Quentin? 
 Kids.. Three of them... I haven't made my piece yet. I'm getting out of here no matter what. That's where my strength comes from. You people find yours wherever you got it. For Christ's sake. What do you live for? Don't you have a wife or a girlfriend or something? 
 Nope, I got a pretty nice collection of pornography 
 Nice, nice. I ain't got anyone either, but I'm not giving up. I'm pissed off. The came into our homes. They stripped us bare. They took my rings. They took my... my amethyst. I wanna know who's responsible. 
 Leaven, your glasses? You don't need them? 
 Well, they took off her jewelry, but they must have put these on you. If nothing is random... why are they here. 
 Leaven, what do you read in school? Math? 
 What can they mean? 
 See what? 
 Wait, wait, wait. How can you make that decision based on one primenumbertrap? 
 You'd remembered all that in your head? 
 Leaven, you beautiful brain... Boot it. 
 Ok, out of the way. 
 Nine or ten hours. 
 How do you know? 
 5 'o clock stubble. the last thing I remember was shaving. 
 Now don't worry. I'll be home in time for dinner. 
 You got a date. 
 Doing good. 
 I need to smoke! I could smoke a butt of a sidewalk. 
 Holloway... Just real yourself in a bit. Come on. Were moving along, things are looking up. 
 Ok. You're right, I quitted smoking years ago. I just need to be occupied. 
 Talk to me. Have a conversation. What kind of doctor are you anyway? 
 Uh, you know, the free kinda... Er, come on help me. Tell me about your rugrats. 
 Ok. We have three boys. Nine, seven and five. 
 Oh, good God. Poor woman. There's no way I'd survived that. 
 She didn't either................. She's not dead, we're just separated. 
 I'm sorry, I can't just shoot the breeze. 
 Ok. Clear. 
 Excuse me, sorry. 
 You could try and help me out here buddy. 
 No, I couldn't 
 We have to backtrack? 
 Not yet. 
 What are you? His coatrack? Oh please. 
 It's stuck! 
 This room is green. 
 Holloway. 
 Hi there. 
 This room is green. 
 Yes it is. 
 I wanna go back to the blue room. 
 Is it shock or what? 
 I think he's mentally handicapped. 
 I like the blue room. 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Hey there, are you all alone? Do you wanna hold my hand, honey? 
 Butter first, then honey, Kazan. Butter first then honey. 
 I wanna go back to the blue room. 
 There's lots of blue rooms. We'll find another one to you real soon. 
 Will you just worry about your own numbers... 
 Go on, I'll look after him. 
 Shall we go for a walk? Kazan, do you wanna go for a walk? 
 Erm' Quentin. Let's not make him do the climbing thing right away. 
 Holloway! 
 Holloway. 
 Could they have taken us all the way to New Mexico? 
 What are you talking about Holloway? 
 I'm talking about: "Where do you hide something this big?" It has at 
 I'm sorry to shake your foundations Quentin, but you have no idea where your tax-dollars go. 
 Free clinic doctors? 
 Only the military industrial complex can afford to build something this size. 
 Holloway, what's the military industrial complex? Have you ever been 
 And how would you know from where you are. 
 What do you think these establishments is? It's just guys like me. Their 
 Is that what you think? 
 Ok, you're a cop. Single bullet theory. Right on. 
 Holloway! Get back here. 
 It's ok. I just swallowed my button. 
 Your boy's having a conniption sitting there. 
 She needs a break. 
 She can do it. 
 They don't look prime to me. 
 Is that your two bits worth, Worth? 
 Of course it's what is worth. 
 Well? 
 What is it? 
 SHUT UP!!! 
 Quentin, hold still! 
 Somebody stop that rackets! 
 Worth. 
 Leave the boots. 
 And shut the fucking door! 
 I had a feeling about that fucking guy. He knew about that trap. 
 Then your numbersystem failed, but he knew. 
 Knew what? How could he know? 
 You're the paranoid, think about it. His only function so far is to kick us when we're down. 
 So, he has a bad attitude. So you think that makes him spy. 
 Trust me on this, it's my job to read people like an x-ray. 
 He doesn't like red rooms. 
 So what happened? 
 Pmfh, you saw what happened! 
 Quentin! 
 Maybe they mean nothing at all. 
 We need to rest anyway. 
 Well that's handy, like if there was nothing fucking else we could do. 
 Are they telling you anything? 
 They're like people. 
 Erm, not here honey, over in the corner. 
 Well, he's just peeing! 
 Jesus Christ! 
 And you find this all pretty funny, don't you? 
 What's your fucking problem Worth? Even Holloway's holding up better than 
 Jawohl, Kommandant! 
 Somebody has to taka responsibility around here. 
 And that somebody has to be you. 
 Not all of us have a luxury of playing nihilists. 
 Not all of us are conceded enough to play hero. 
 It's the will to live, everybody's got it Worth, even you, especially you 
 The will to live. That's the warm, coasy feeling deep inside. Thanks 
 Arh, poor Worth: "Nobody loves me". If that's the chip on your shoulders, 
 Do it. Show us you have some backbone and jump into the sushimachine. Be 
 Thought so. 
 Fuck you Quentin. I don't wanna die, I'm just being realistic. Do you 
 Do you think they would lay clues, if there wasn't a way out. 
 You think we matter, we don't 
 Put us out of your misery so we can get on and get out of here. 
 Oh, you're not getting out. 
 Yes, we are! 
 There is no way outta here!!! 
 Got ya. 
 How... Do you know? 
 Answer the question Worth. 
 Oh, God! 
 Who are you? 
 I am the poison. I designed the outer shell. 
 What? 
 The shell, the sarcophagus. 
 Not this part, the exterior. I don't know anything about the numbers or 
 For Gods sake, Worth. You knew what it was. 
 No 
 Worth! You're lying. 
 Not first. 
 Who's beyond it? 
 I don't know. 
 Who hired you? 
 I didn't ask. I never even left my office. I talked on the phone to some 
 Bullshit! You knew from square one. Look at him, he's up to his eyeballs 
 No Quentin. That's how they stay hidden. You keep everyone separated so 
 Whose brain? 
 It's all the same machine right. Pentagon. Multinational coorporations. 
 Holloway, you don't get it. 
 Then tell me, please, I need to know. 
 It's maybe hard for you to understand, but there's no conspiracy. Nobody 
 What kind of fucking explanation is that? 
 It's the best you´re gonna get. I looked and the only explanation I can 
 Somebody had to say yes to this thing. 
 What thing? Only we know what it is. 
 We have no idea, what it is. 
 We know more than anybody else. I mean somebody might have known 
 Why put people in it? 
 Because it's here. you have to use it or admit it's pointless. 
 But it is pointless! 
 Quentin... That's my point. 
 What have we come to? It's so much worse than I thought. 
 Not really, just more pathetic. 
 You make me sick, Worth! 
 I make me sick too. We´re both part of the system. I drew a box - you 
 Is that how we're ruining the world? 
 Now I feel better. 
 That's why you stayed with us. To confess. 
 Still looking for someone to bust, Quentin? 
 Quentin, Quentin, STOP IT! 
 What for? 
 Have you gone absolutely mad? He's the only one who knows nything about 
 Hi... 
 Yeah. 
 I assume so. 
 There's one door. 
 Wherever the doorguy put it. Six guesses and it's sealed from the 
 434 feetsquare. 
 Come on. Side over. 
 The inner cube cannot be flushed by the shell. There is a space. 
 I don't know. It makes sense. 
 17.576 rooms? Oh, God that makes me queasy. 
 What? 
 In English. Slower. 
 Then where are we? 
 Alright, let's go. 
 Just out of curuiosity. I mean don't hit me again or anything. But what 
 Maybe we can get the door open. 
 Wrong. 
 What we need to do is figure out how we get around the traps. 
 I'm dealing with that Holloway. I'm looking for practical solutions here. 
 Well, you haven't found any yet! 
 We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot. Worth will go in first. 
 No he won't Quentin, we take turns! 
 Relax. 
 Is there room for two in there? 
 What's the matter? 
 What about them? 
 I guess that means we're not having dinner. 
 Trap, trap, trap. TRAP! 
 
! 
 (Whispers) It's soundactivated. BOOOH! 
 Lovely. 
 Must be reat to ignore it. 
 So that's it. The edge is surrounded by traps. 
 Who knows how many detours we'll have to take. I say we cross the bitch. 
 Right. 
 How many boots do we have left Holloway? 
 Get it off him. We know how it works, we just have to be quiet. 
 Pretty fucking quiet. 
 I'm glad you're on sight Worth, because you're up. 
 And he's not coming. 
 Of course he is. 
 No way! 
 You're not leaving him behind. 
 He's unpredictable. When we get to the edge we can come back for him, but 
 Shame on you. Will you look at yourselves. What have you turned into? 
 That's a lie and you know it. 
 He'll be quiet. 
 Hah! 
 You fucking fuck! 
 That's enough! 
 He's a trap! 
 Let him go right now! 
 Law of the jungle Holloway. He's a danger in the pack! 
 Let him go you nazi! 
 What did you call me? 
 Quentin! You let that innocent boy go. 
 You listen to me woman. Every day I mop up after your bleeding heart. The 
 Oh, I do. 
 No wonder your wife left you. All that bottled-up anger. And a thing for 
 God help you Quentin. Did you smack your kids around too? 
 Open it. 
 Door number six, not door number one, door number two. 
 Open the fucking thing. 
 ("singing") Sunshine. 
 Nighttime. 
 My old friend the shell. 
 It's there. Morning! 
 Hang on to me. 
 Can't see shit. Nothing to hang on to. 
 We have to try something. We gotta see if the door's over there. Someone 
 Forget it. 
 I'll go. 
 I'm going Holloway. 
 She's right Quentin, you're too heavy. I'm the lightest after Leaven. 
 How long did you know people we're put in here. 
 A couple of months. 
 That's not long , if you consider your whole life. 
 I am. 
 You opened my eyes Worth, that´s something. 
 David. 
 Helen. 
 And such a Helen. 
 That's as far as you go. 
 There's nothing down here. Hold tight. I'll try swinging over there. 
 Hurry, you're getting heavy. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 Get up here now! 
 Quentin... 
 What's going on? 
 She... slipped. 
 Holloway. 
 Sssh! Come on Kazan. Kazan will you please stop doing that! 
 Leaven, you gotta be strong sweetheart. 
 We gotta get down to the bottom. It'll be easier to get on to shell from 
 Sure you can. It's your gift. 
 Let her sleep for a while. We haven't slept for fucking hours. 
 Ok, one hour. 
 How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is? 
 An hour is as long as I say. 
 We have to make it down to the bottom. There'll be quiet there and you 
 They're traps! We are the key. I get us down there. You think us out. 
 We fit like numbers. A man and a woman. Two halves of the equation. I 
 I'll slip you on the lock. 
 Leaven... It's time to go down. 
 Get away from her. Leaven, they're fucking spy's. Him, the retard. 
 Just go Quentin 
 You don't want the boot. 
 You wanna come with us Worth? Down the hatch. 
 What the fuck's with him? 
 How does he...? 
 (laughing) It's The Wren, the old Renster. 
 How could...? 
 (laughing) We've been going in circles 
 That can't be. 
 Where are we? 
 Where are we??? 
 You were right Worth. There is no outta here. 
 (crying) Get away from me. 
 Wasn't Rennes killed in that room? 
 How come there's nothing out there. 
 You see an edge. 
 We were not at the edge before. Where's the room that killed Rennes? 
 Fuck off! 
 Oh, that was good. 
 What difference does it make? We're dead anyways. 
 HEY! Listen to what I'm saying! There was a room there before! We haven't 
 The rooms? 
 That explains the thunder, the shaking. We've been shifting the whole 
 What are you on to Leaven. 
 Right. 
 Permutations. 
 Permu... what? 
 The numbers tell you all that? 
 Ok, so it's moving. How do we get out? 
 Where? 
 Back off, Quentin! 
 I just wanna know, don't you wanna know? 
 What about it? 
 A bridge? 
 What are you talking about? 
 So the bridge is just a bridge... 
 Well the size of us... It must take days to complete a full cycle. 
 So when does it open? 
 And what does that mean. 
 666... 897... 466... 
 567... 898... ok? 
 And 545... Did you get that? 
 656... 778... 462... 
 Do we have time? 
 Then let's go. 
 Can you work out the traps in the system? 
 Fuck the traps, let's get to the bridge. 
 Well you threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot. 
 Technically? 
 Ok, so? 
 Can you calculate that? 
 But you can, right? You can? 
 You don't need a computer. 
 Figure it out! 
 I'm not dying in a fucking ratmaze. 
 Two... Astronomical. 
 What did you say? 
 Astronomical. 
 Before that... 
 Factors... 
 Two... 
 What are you fucking kidding? 
 Three... 
 One... Gumdrop. 
 Gumdrop! 
 Kazan, I'll give you a whole box of gumdrops for each answer. 
 Gumdrops come in bags. 
 You want 'em in bags, you got 'em in bags. 
 I don't like the red ones. 
 8-9-8. 
 Two... 
 5-4-5. 
 Two... 
 Astronomical. 
 You're telling me Tell-A-Son boy is a genius. 
 There's only one way to find out. 
 Safe. 
 Kazan, my man! 
 What's the numbers boy? Right here! Look here! Make him do it. 
 Primenumbers. 
 Two... 
 Two... 
 Three... 
 Move. Come on let's go. You too Worth. Move your scuddy ass Worth, I'm 
 Go! Hurry! 
 Leaven. 
 You fuckheads, you're dead! 
 Two... 
 One.. 
 Check the floor. 
 Not quite. 
 Not even close, Worth! When I'm finish I'll throw you in a fucking trap 
 Where is he? Come here! I said come here riiight.......... 
 Got ya. That way. 
 Two... 
 Four... 
 Oh. 
 I guess that proves out theory. The numbers. 
 Four, two, three. 
!!! 
 I'm gonna find him. What do you think? 
 Kazan? 
 I didn't move. 
 Yeah, good. Erm, you have to climb up here, ok? 
 I don't like that. 
 Five bags of gumdrops? 
 27 bags total. 
 27 bags, deal. 
 We're coming. 
 Eaoh, it' better be it. 
 Where? 
 Ooh, arh. 
 The bridge. 
 Red... 
 38079 
 Go ahead. 
 I have nothing to live for out there. 
 Boundless human stupidity. 
 Nooo! 
 Kazan get out to the door!

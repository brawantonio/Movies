 No one can deny the horrendous nature of Mr. Frankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years he has been with us, I have never seen a patient turn his energies to more productive use. 
 Just look at his accomplishments... three volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture garden, four romance novels... and who can forget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow in our all-psychotic production of "Carousel"... 
 Directed by our own Doctor Anabel Leek. 
 Twenty years ago I was a lost soul. Loveless... (with a son-like glance at Doctor Bierce) Fatherless... (chokes on the word) A... psycho! (breaks down sobbing) Oh!  How could I have done it? The murder... the mayhem... all of those lovely young girls! (weeping, a brilliant performance) I'm sorry!  I'm SO SO SORRY! 
 (pulls himself together) But my deeds have been done, and my youth is gone, and we can only go forward in this cruel world... and if I have learned anything from my wretched life it is that... When you walk through a storm, keep your head held high... (singing) And don't be afraid of the dark... 
 (almost wistfully) Boom. 
 Those gas leaks can be murder. 
 I'm home. 
 1 Golf anyone? 
 2 Not a bad night's work. 
 3 Hey, Boss, we got a stowaway. 
 4 (about to slug him) Who you laughin' at, punk? 
 2 He's just a tyke.  Lighten up. 
 5 He's kinda cute. 
 3 If you like drool. 
 2 Hey, why don't we sell him back to his parents? For a million bucks! 
 3 So what should we do with him? 
 3 Come on, kid, you're goin' for a swim. 
. 
 Not so fast, gentlemen--and I use the term loosely... Unhand that youngster... 
 Or you're mulch. 
 And there's plenty more where that came from. 
 GET 'EM! 
 Crush him, Mikey!... Mash him!... Mush him! 
 He wants more!... Squish him!... Finish him off! 
 (0.S.) Is there a problem? 
 IT'S CAPTAIN AMAZING! 
 We give!... We're sorry!... We had terrible childhoods!  (Etc.) 
 Nice work, Captain. 
 (putty in his hands, pudding in his bowl) Looks like you've done it again, Captain. 
 1 Okay, show's over. Move it. On your way. 
 Wait a minute, Officers. You don't understand-- we're superheroes, and we just busted up this gang. 
 1 Really?  Let me guess-you're Towel Head and he's... (meaning the Shoveler) Captain Pooper Scooper! 
 1 Hey!  Move it! 
 2 Get a life! 
 1 And leave crime fighting to the real thing! 
 1 Wannabes. 
 2 Pathetic. 
 (nursing a sore jaw) He doesn't miss a trick, does he? 
 Oh don't start that again-- 
! 
 There's a vague similarity. 
 (downing some aspirin) 0h, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore.  Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps--and for what? 
 We take the licks and he gets the chicks. 
 How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen? 
 But look at him... and look at us. 
 The camera loves him. 
 I lost another fork tonight.  She's getting suspicious, I know it. 
 I can't. 
 (upset) Because I can't!  Okay?  She wouldn't understand! 
 Leave him alone.  She's his mother, not yours. 
 So when are we gonna have an on night? 
 Hi. 
 You're... new. 
 It's my first night.  My name's Monica. 
 You guys going to a costume party? 
 We're superheroes. 
 Really?  Like Captain Amazing? 
 Are you famous? 
 Not yet. 
 So you're like... struggling superheroes? 
 We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... (does a very impressive little flipping thing with his place setting) 
 Wow. 
 And these are my associatiates, the Shoveler. 
 Hi. 
 And Mister Furious... His anger is his power. 
 (intrigued by Furious) Really? 
 Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill.  In his case, it's entirely emotional. 
 So what can I get you? 
 Burgers all around. (meaning himself) Medium. (meaning the Shoveler) Rare. (meaning Furious} Raw. 
 She likes you. 
 Definitely. 
 Ask her out. 
 Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date? 
 So you're chicken? 
 I guess... Are you always so angry? 
 Not tonight. (picks up an order and walks away) 
 Maybe you should try a more romantic approach. 
 Or flowers. 
 Hey, when are you guys gonna clean this place up? 
 When you're on TV. 
. Right--like that will ever happen. 
 Save any babies lately? 
 Faster than a speeding turtle-- 
 More powerful than a deodorant-- 
. Able to eat twelve donuts in a single sitting-- 
 Look, snoring in his chair-- 
. Sitting on the john-- 
 (feels for him) Rough night, Eddie? 
 Jeffrey! 
 Oh hi, Mom. 
 What are you doing in the silver drawer? 
 Looking for... the TV Guide. 
 It's on the television. 
 Of course.  I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy. Go to bed. 
 - 
 - 
 I hope you enjoy these cigars.  I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them. 
 P Ummm. 
 Have you considered my offer? 
 P You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you.  You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe.  You were the King... 
 P But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge. 
 I got it. 
 P What about Captain Amazing? 
 I knew you'd cone.  I left that skylight open for you. 
 I knew you'd know. 
 But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know? 
 Really? 
 I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance? 
 Except for one little thing. 
 That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk. 
 YO! CAPTAIN SOMINEX!  Get your shut-eye at home, or you'll be a full time superhero! 
 It's all within your power.  The only thing that's in your way is YOU! 
 Easy for you to say. 
 - 
 ...and continues to deny any knowledge of the incident... In local news, millionaire Lance Hunt has apparently disappeared... 
 Members at his household told police that the playboy philanthropist failed to return home last night after "going out for a walk". Police say they have no reason yet to suspect foul play, but a search is under way... 
 But we don't know for sure it's the same guy. 
 Hey, look. 
 Well, Don, I've done some terrible things in my life, but now I'm cured, and I just want to give back something to my old home town... That's why I'm using what's left of my fortune to build... 
 (O.S.) The Frankenstein Center for the Arts. 
 You've changed, haven't you? 
 Oh yes. 
 (in a whisper, holding him back) Wait!... Look! 
 - 
 This is bad. 
 Who are they? 
 The Disco Boys. 
 The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced.  Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard.  But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork. 
 We may be getting in over our heads here. 
 This looks like a job for Superman-- 
 Or Batman-- 
 Or both. 
! (goes right over the wall) 
 Everything's going exactly as we planned. 
 (puts the sharp point of her comb handle under his chin) Not quite.  You haven't announced our engagement yet. 
 It must have slipped my mind. 
 Your mind is so slippery. 
 Don't worry, Pootchkie.  My womanizing days are over.  You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole. (pulls her into his arms) We're such an incredible team.  Who could possibly stop us? (kisses her) 
 Don't crunch the leaves. 
 Sorry. 
 Be a Mohican. (bumps into a lawn chair) 
 I'm soaked. (sneezes) Oh great. 
 Be a Mohican. 
 Shut up. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Oh I'm sorry.  We must have the wrong house. 
 P You sure do. 
 Hi there. 
 Superheroes. 
 P Should I kill them? 
 (completely disdainful) Why bother? 
 Here you go. (sits with them, applies a compress to the Raja's head) 
 Ow. 
 Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something. 
 Miss! 
 Maybe she's right. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Agents? 
 And it would be the right thing to do. 
 But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal. 
 I'm liking this. 
 (after a moment) Yeah, but... who do we know? 
 Do we have to? 
 I got this cousin.  He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible. 
 How could I see him if he's invisible? 
 And there's the Sphinx. 
 The who? 
 He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete. 
 No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station. 
 Get outta here. 
 Yeah. 
 Yes. 
 But... only when no one is looking. 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 So you're only invisible... to yourself? 
 No. 
 (hopefully) No? 
 If I look at myseif, I become visible. 
 So you're only invisible, when abuolutely no one is looking at you? 
 Yes. 
 I just know. 
 (desperate) I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance? 
 Boy I can't tell you how thrilled I was when you guys called--You gonna eat that pickle? (sucks it in) I've always dreamed of being a member of the a real superhero team--and to have friends--real friends--I mean guys I could live with--sleep with--die with--eat with... 
 I love mustard. 
 So what exactly is your superpower? 
 Well, when I was a kid I grew up on Love Canal- -remember that?--and my brothers and I used to go swimming in it--make Kool-Aid out of it-- stuff like that.  Anyway my brothers all died, but I lived, and I grew all these like weird organs that have never been seen in humans before.  So now I can do things like this! 
 Cool, huh? 
 Sorry, sorry. 
 Hey, why don't you just put a cork in it? 
 I tried that once.  The cork melted. 
 There's just not enough of us. 
 And a social life. 
 Yeah, but how do we get to them? 
 Obscene phone calls? 
 Why don't you throw a barbecue? (moves off to another table) 
 Come on in!  The water's great! 
 (heavy on the sarcasm) Great picnic, Dad. 
. Big turnout. 
 Are these guys real superheroes? 
 They think so. 
 But where's Captain Amazing? 
. He wouldn't be caught dead here. 
 Hey, these pool mints are delicious! 
 Maybe there was traffic. 
 Come on, guys--we're fighting against evil. 
 There's a big difference. 
 Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you. 
 They're here! 
 Hey, man, is this the superhero wingding? 
 This is it.  Come on in! 
 All right!  Party!  (Etc.) 
 I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware. 
 I am Squeegee Man, and these are my compadres, the Invincible Dudes! 
 Whoa!  Brews!  Party!  (Etc.) 
 Would you mind filling out these forms; names, addresses, description of superpowers, that sort of thing. 
 Sure, dude.  No problem.  (Etc.) (but they just toss the forms away) 
 1 Hey, man, like where are the babes? 
 2 It said on the card there'd be babes! 
 Actually we lied about the babes, but there's plenty of burgers. 
 That's false advertising!... We came all the way from South Champion, man!  We coulda gone plinking!... We coulda gone bunqee jumping! 
 No babes.  No peace. 
 Let's trash the place! 
 Yeah! 
 I am Squeegee Man. (holding it out threateningly) Touch my squeegee... and you die. 
 No. 
 Let's get out of here!... That dude's crazy! 
 (O.S.) Who died? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm the Bowler. 
 The Bowler?  I remember him from when I was a kid.  He was killed years ago. 
 I'm his daughter. 
 Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing. 
 Really? 
 Good ball. 
 If it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be impressed, right? 
 I thought you'd never ask. 
 (O.S.) He was more than just a superhero...  He was my father... 
 And then one day, he didn't come home.  The police said it was an accident.  But cargo containers don't just fall on people.  He was murdered... After that I fell apart.  I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk.  When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do. 
 So who killed him? 
 The Disco Boys. 
 But there's still only six of us. 
 That's two more than the Fantastic Four. 
 Twice the Three Stooges! 
 And only one short of the Magnificent Seven. 
 And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway. 
 He was cute though. 
 But they all had one thing we haven't got. 
 Girlfriends? 
 A name.  All the great superhero teams have got a fabulous name. 
 How about... the Savage Six? 
 The Inscrutable Six? 
 The Six Pistols? 
 The Exterminators! 
 The Obliterators! 
 The Eradicators! 
 The Emasculators! 
 Wait--I got it!... The Spleen Team. 
 P Little old lady.  That's a hundred points! 
 P He knows your every move. 
 P Not these guys again! 
 Nice car. 
 Captain who? 
 P (spots the Bowler) Hey, in the backseat, who are you supposed to be, the Bowler? 
 I'm his daughter. 
 P His daughter?  Well guess what, sweetheart? I'm the one who squished your Daddy.  And he squished real good! 
 P 
! 
 Waste him! 
! 
 (impressed by Furious) That boy's got talent. 
 P And I'm gonna nip it in the bud. 
 To us! 
 Whatever our name is. 
 Even his snores smell bad. 
 But she's your mother.  You gotta tell her. 
 I can't. 
 Dad thinks all this superhero stuff is a stupid waste of time. 
 But he plays golf, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine.  Law. 
 But you're a superhero. 
 The cape.  The turban.  She wouldn't understand. 
 I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask.  They thought I'd lost it. 
 But in fact... you'd found it. 
 This is your dream... and you can't ever give it up. 
 I wonder what he dreams about? 
 We don't want to know. 
 P There. 
 - 
 It's late.  I'm headin' home. 
 Me, too. 
 (to Invisible Boy) Come on, Junior, it's a school night. 
 P Hi, cutie. 
 P Six losers. Six bullets. Perfect... Got any last words, Angry Boy? 
 P Disco sucks.  Very good.  You know what I'm gonna do, Angry Boy, since you're so colorful? I'm gonna save you for last. 
 P Sweet dreams, punk. 
 P (holding half a pistol) 
... 
 P Get him! 
 P What? 
 P (freaking out) LET'S GET OUTTA HERE! 
 And you are a fool. 
 You call yourselves superheroes? A rooster fights more intelligently than you!  You have shown yourself to your enemy and revealed your powers to him--and what have you accouplished for this?  You have destroyed his car. Brilliant!  If you want to survive you must fight like a wolf pack--not like a six pack! 
 The wolf is cunning.  He knows that stealth is his greatest weapon, and he always fights as a team... (more) 
 Casanova Frankenstein is a a master of evil. You will need more than shovels and dessert forks to stop him... What else have you got? 
 He's got the fact that he's Superman! 
 Bullets bounce off him! 
 Firepower costs money. 
 Anybody got any? 
 We didn't think this through very well. 
 (after a moment) My father had this friend... He was an inventor... 
 Are you sure he's still lives here? 
 Are you sure he's still alive? 
 He was the last time I saw him. 
 When was that? 
 I was eight. 
 Yes! 
 Doctor Heller? 
 (doesn't recognize her) Yes! 
 It's me... Elizabeth. 
 Elizabeth!  Little Elizabeth!  Why you're so... middle aged! 
 Thanks. 
 How's your dad? 
 He's dead. 
 Oh that's right--they squished him...  Heck of a guy. 
 Doc, these are my friends.  We're superheroes, and we need your help. 
 Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers-- 
 Doctor, we need your weapons. 
 (ecstatic) My weapons? You need my weapons? 
 The military establishment has never understood me.  They won't return my phone calls, much less field test anything.  But I knew that someday I'd get my chance, and now... here you are! (pulls open the barn door) 
 But, Doc... where's the machine guns? 
 The bazookas? 
 The lasers? 
 You don't need that junk!  You see, for thousands of years mankind has been immolating, disemboweling, and exploding itself.  Why? Because we have this built-in screwed up need to go to war! (more) 
 Now here's a beauty! (picks up a purple and orange sprayer that looks like a suped up water gun) I call it the Shrinker!  I developed it after years of studying the worst dry cleaners I could find.  It instantly shrinks fabrics to half their size.  Anyone caught in its spray is immediately immobilized by their own clothing! 
 Hey, Mister Bad Mood. 
 (pulls the ring on the can) Catch. 
 He's got the air cannon! 
 I know. 
 No. 
 We are not yet ready.  Now we must learn to fight together... as one thing. 
 Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king. 
 Crime was rampant.  It wasn't safe to stay in your home. 
 Much less go outside. 
 Then Captain Amazing appeared. 
 He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing. 
 And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since. 
 The wise snake coils before he strikes. 
 You drink too much. 
 (pointedly) When I am sure I am among friends. 
 Roy-- 
 Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart. 
 It is not dead.  It is hiding. 
 Has he always been like this? 
 (to husband) Oh this place looks great. 
 Now honey, you just wait in the car.  Mommy and Daddy will be right beck. 
 It's nice and cool in here. 
 (as they sit at the bar) Barkeep, a couple of cold ones. 
 And here's a banana for your monkey. 
 Couple more? 
 You bet. 
 OH MY GOD! 
 Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God! 
 (0.S.) Hi. 
 Alone tonight? 
 (in a whisper) Adolescence was the worst--The other kids made fun of me, so I'd spit on them and they'd scatter--I've never had a girlfriend--unless you count that night with my cousin--She recovered fully though--We exchange cards every Christmas--Well, I send her one, and she sends it back... (spritzes somathing into his mouth, then offers it to Invisible Boy) Bug repellent? 
 (0.S.) Where are they going? 
 (runs after him) Kid! 
 ...still no sign of millionaire Lance Hunt, and now, in an unrelated story, another one of Champion City's leading citizens has apparently disappeared. Captain Amazing has not been seen or heard from in a week. Authorities believe that the hard working superhero may just be taking a well deserved rest. 
 Cancun perhaps? 
 Sounds good to me, Don. 
 Date? 
 I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home? 
 That was easy. (goes back to work) 
 Honey, our ship's come in. 
 Just give me the word. 
 (gets an idea) Wait.  I'll be right there. (hangs up, starts off) 
 (peeved) Where are you going? 
 Head hunting. 
 I admire you. 
 Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish. 
 Most people just want to make money or be famous or something.  But you risk everything, just to help people. 
 Who wouldn't? 
 I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress. 
 What's your real name? 
 Have you always lived here? 
 Me too... I love this stupid old town.  It's noisy.  It's smelly. It's falling apart. 
 Yeah. 
 CASANOVA'S POV 
 I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but... 
 Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does. 
 You don't seem very angry right now. 
 You know what?  Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him. 
 That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy. 
 Going my way? 
 Take it easy--take it easy.  I just want to have a little chat... That was quite a number you did on my car.  You've got a lot of violence in you... and I like that in a guy. 
 You know what the difference is between good and evil, Roy? 
 Evil is more fun.  When you want something, you just take it, and if somebody gets in your way, you kill them... You seem like a very frustrated guy, Roy.  Unhappy. Unfulfilled. What is it that you've always wanted, always desired?  Because whatever it is, I can give it to you... Fame? (snaps his fingers) Easy.  Fortune?  Even easier. Women? (laughs) The easiest of all. 
 I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy.  In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it.  It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say? 
 (flairs) They always call the great ones nuts. 
 (his psychosis showing) Are you with me... or against me? 
 Too bad.  PLUG HIM! 
 
! 
 You're dead. 
 Be careful with my baby. 
 1 Freeze! 
 2 Hands up! 
 2 What are you two doing here? 
 1 Not talking, eh?  That can be fixed.  Turn around, start walking up the hill-- 
 2 And no funny business. 
 (after a moment, to Invisible Boy, in a whisper) Pinch 'em. 
 Whatever was in that crate... is from Russia. 
 Amigo. 
 What did he mean? 
 Maybe it's time we checked that place out. 
 But how do we get in? 
 So where's the art? 
 This place is built like a fortress. 
 What's that? 
 (stunned) Oh my God... Every crook in the city is here. 
 (O.S.) The Bone Heads from the South Side... 
 (O.S.) The Bland Boys from Downtown... 
 (O.S.) Italian Ice... 
 (O.S.) The Stapler... 
 (0.S.) The Elvis Brothers. 
 Excuse me. 
 (reading her name tag) Monica... Beautiful name.  It suits you. 
 I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia". 
 Really? 
 Are you an actress? 
 Just a waitress. 
 You underestimate yourself. 
 You know I'm writing a play--it's just a little Broadway thing, but thure's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for. 
 Really? 
 I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon? 
 Sure--I guess. 
 Terrific. 
 What are you three doing here? This is invited guests only.  Out. 
 That was too close. 
 But we gotta find out what's going on in there. 
 What are you guys doing here? 
 RAJA & SHOVELER Shhhh! 
 Thank you all for coming.  I hope you enjoy the cigars.  I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them. 
 Twenty years ago, this town was yours!  AND I WAS YOUR KING! 
 (tragically) But they called me a psycho, and they put me away.  For twenty years I rotted in my cell, painting watercolors, writing haikus--just waiting for the day I could take my revenge. Well, brothers, that day has come! 
 They thought I was crazy? Well the joke's on them--because tonight at precisely midnight--on the twentieth anniversary of my tragic arrest-- every man, woman, and child in this city is going to turn into a RAVING PSYCSOTIC!  Mothers will murder their tots!  Old ladies will strangle their cats!  Children will bump off their babysitters! 
 You're outta your mind! 
 I beg your pardon? 
 Nobody could drive a whole city crazy. 
 Tell you what, Ice.  I'll mke you a friendly little wager.  It I can't do it... you can blow my brains out.  If I can, I'll blow out yours. 
 Done. 
 (to Anabel, with a smile) Honey, give the boys a taste. 
 That was great!... What the hell was that?... How did you do that? 
 Tonight, at midnight, that sound will be amplified across this entire city.  Murder and mayhem will reign supreme!  And Champion City will be ours again!  This will be our castle! And I will be our king!  And there's no one to stop us! 
 Don't worry, fellas... (moves to Captain Amazing, and puts his arm chummily around him) I killed him... and I've had him stuffed. 
 I The King is back! 
 2 Long live the King! 
 What could have made such a horrible noise? 
 (after a moment, gravely) He's got the Psychostridulator. 
 Ten years ago the Kremlin's top secret Psychiatric Warfare Division developed a prototype for a weapon that emitted a fluctuating alternative frequency noise that produced a violent psychotic reaction in any mammal within hearing distance.  But when the old Soviet Union fell the stridulator and its brilliant inventor, Doctor Kopov, disappeared. 
 This Kopov, what happened to him? 
 Not him... her. 
 Did she look like that? 
 Yes. 
 (hopefully) Maybe it won't work. 
 A village in Siberia was wiped out when a cleaning woman switched it on by mistake. 
 We've got to warn the city. 
 How? 
 No one will believe us. 
 They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes. 
 We're outnumbered twenty to one. 
 It's suicide. 
 Now you're talking. 
 Sounds good to me. 
 Let's do it. 
 And we'll take a bunch of 'em with us! 
 I just want you guys to know--I may not be a superhero, but I'm with you--and I want to help! 
 We could really use some coffee-- 
 And some sandwiches-- 
 With mustard! 
 (her feelings a little hurt) Sure. 
 But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is-- 
 Or even what it looks like. 
 And he must have it well hidden. 
 Victoria o morte. 
! 
 Baby, if I don't make it... find yourself... a normal guy. 
 I don't want a normal guy. 
 Jeffrey, YOU THIEF! 
 Mother... it's not what you think! 
 And why are you wearing that silly costume? 
 (painfully) Because... I'M A SUPERHERO! 
 Oh, Mother, I'm sorry.  I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family--but it's just not who I am! 
 But... the silverware? 
 I use it... to fight evil. 
 (after a moment) Jeffrey... this is wonderful. 
 (stunned) It is? 
 I always knew that you were special. 
 You did? 
 Ever since you were a little boy... (gets an idea, excited) Come with me. 
 This is for you. 
 Your Great Great Grandmother's wedding silver. 
 Bitchin'. 
 Mon Capitan, it's for you. (tosses him the phone) 
 (on a phone, speaking very softly) It's me. 
 At the Frankenstein Center. 
 I'm going inside. 
 Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it.  Maybe--just maybe--I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing. 
 Just shut up and listen.  Hold off the attack as long as you can.  If I can discover the location I'll call you-- 
 Then at least I will have died trying, right? 
 Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now...  I think you're wonderful. 
 Bye. (and she hangs up) 
 Could you tell Mr. Frankenstein that Monica is here? 
 Sure, doll. 
 (worried about him) Hey... you okay? 
 Hi. 
 I thought you'd chickened out on me. 
 Just wanted to... powder my nose. 
 How 'bout giving me "the tour"? 
 Why not? 
 Big, isn't it? 
 - 
 Don't worry.  It's not activated. 
 Who's the artist? 
 Me. 
 He is in love.  His anger is gone. 
 Oh no. 
 Great timing! 
 This is where I come to... be alone. 
 Oh, look at that view. 
 Snap out of it! 
 Get on to yourself! 
 (shouting right in his face) GET MAD! 
 He's turned into a completely normal person! 
 I'm chilly. 
 Look!  Your favorite sunglasses! (snaps them in two) 
 Your Roy Rogers coffee mug! (hurls it against the wall) 
 Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! (breaks the head off it) 
 Come here. 
 I'm not that kind of girl. 
 Then why are you here? 
 Curiosity. 
 (with a smile) Remember the cat. 
 What are you doing all alone in the dark? 
 Fantasizing... about you. 
 I thought you were done? 
 One last tweak. 
 If this doesn't do it, nothing will! 
 It's working! 
 It's time. 
 With or without him, we gotta go! 
 Our guests are waiting. 
 I'll be down in a jiffy. 
 I'd better go. 
 You're a spy. 
 (offguard) What? 
 I saw him walk you home. 
 Who? 
 Roy. 
 Don't be afraid... I never hit a lady... 
 Stay away! 
 Or you'll what?  CAN ME? 
 That bitch! 
 Are you coming or not? 
 Not a chance! 
 Come on, guys... Pick up... 
 CASANOVA'S VOICE What's the matter... 
 Nobody home? 
 Here we go! 
 We've got lift off! 
 May the forks be with us! 
 First is good. 
 I want her alive. 
 Yes, Mr. Frankenstein. 
 Daddy, what is that thing? 
 I don't know, son. 
 A Herkimer?  Those yuppies will drive anything. 
 Amigo, we need you. 
 Just GET MAD! 
 Fellas, this is woman without whom I would have gone sane. (kisses her neck) 
 1 What the hell is that? 
 2 Looks like... a Ford Dumpster. 
 
! 
 Hang on! 
 It's showtime. 
 P What's that? 
 Mr. Frankenstein, we're being attacked. 
 By whom? 
 P They'll never get through those doors. 
 Come on, baby! 
 Do it, big boy! 
 Atta, girl! 
 Atta, boy! 
 Well kill them. 
 Where am I going? 
 (pointing to an archway on the other side of the hall) Through there! 
 Right. 
 No good!  She's dead! 
 P Spam in a can! 
 With what? 
 1 Who are those guys? 
 Not bad for a normal guy! 
 Amigos! 
 Wait!  Look! 
 Laser eye... and it's a humdinger. 
 No problem. 
 P We'll take care of these clowns. 
 2 Piece a cake. 
 Doc, there's got to be a way. 
 MONICA'S VOICE It's up here!  It's up here! 
 ROY!  THE PSYCHO THING IS--! 
 Thanks, Roy!  She's just my type. You can have her back... when I'm done! 
 He'll never make it. 
 Think positive. 
 (to himself) I can do it. 
 (admiring her) Some girls just know how to die. 
 You two timing psychotic bastard. 
 Darling, you've got the wrong idea. 
 (aiming at his heart) Do I? 
 I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing. (moving toward her, turning on that old Frankenstein Charm) Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night.  It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for.  She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you.  I worship you.  I want to make you my bride. 
 There's just one thing... (with a psychotic smile) I don't need you anymore. 
 Don't worry, Darling.  I never hit a lady. 
 Heads up! 
 Guys, I did it! I did it!  I'm invisible! 
 Can you see me? 
 Nuts. 
 Kid, turn that thing off! 
 
 HEY! CREEPS! 
 This is it!  DO OR DIE! 
 And the light goes out... 
 Roy... What took you so long? 
 Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you. 
 Smarts, doesn't it?... Shall we dance? 
 P Let's rush 'em! 
... 
 Help!... Get me out of this! (Etc.) 
 (0.S.) Gentlemen! 
 Roy, you're making this too easy. 
 P Say hello to Daddy for me! 
 (grimly) Daddy says hello. 
 BALL'S POV - 
 Let's change the tune. 
 
 WHAT A RUSH! (tosses the remote off the balcony) 
... 
 You're beautiful when you're angry. 
 Mama! 
 I'm home. 
 Few details have emerged... 
 (0.S.) ...but the Dawn Patrol got this exclusive interview vith two of the suspects. 
 I I don't know who those guys were--but I never want to see 'em again. 
 2 Especially that big dude with the shovel... 
 1 (near tears) He was the worst! 
 Dad!... Dad!... You okay?... You hurt? 
 (shocked by this welcome) I'm okay--I'm all right. 
. Lean on me, Dad. 
 I'll hold your shovel, Dad. 
 You want a soda, Dad? 
 (stunned) Okay. 
 Nice work. Dad. 
 Thanks, Roland. 
 You really are a superhero, aren't you? 
 And that's when the engine blew up. 
 Whoa... 
 What did you do? 
 Well... 
 So you're never actually conscious of range or trajectory? 
 Heck no.  I just chuck 'em. 
 It's been twenty-four hours since the deadly psycho-sonic attack and bloody shoot-out that left Casanova Frankenstein and dozen of the city's top hoodlums dead... But tonight the question remains... Who were these heroic mystery men who saved our city?... 
 Could have been anybody. 
 Wait a minute... That's it.  That's our name. We're... the Mystery Men. 
 Hey, do I look like a Man? 
 Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People. 
 (singing, ala "Macho Man") Mystery, Mystery Man... I want to be a Mystery Man... 
 SHOVELER & RAJA Shut up. 
 Eat your mustard. 
 Yes, Obie-wan. 
 Hey... he's gone. 
 "Until you need me again... Adios." 
 I miss him already. 
 Miss... who are those guys?

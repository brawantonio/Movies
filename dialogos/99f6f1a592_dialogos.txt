 "KALIFORNIA" 
 
 Her father worked the night shift here. Most nights he'd bring her with him. (pause) She was eleven years old. 
 This is it. This is the where he'd take her whenever he had the urge to molest her. 
 Of course! Nobody would have heard her cries over the noise of the machines. 
 Damn! This defroster never works... 
 Have a problem with your car? 
 This is where she murdered her first victim. They found his body over in the corner, shot through the head. 
 They found her second victim over there. 
 (unconvincingly) ...sure. 
 (scans the dashboard) Yeah. It's here somewhere. It's my wife's car. Ah... there it is. 
 She lured them here with the promise of sex. (beat) Imagine the anger and hatred she must have felt returning to this place. Did she use that to help her pull the trigger? 
 Shhhhhhhhh. 
 (unconvincingly) ...nothing. 
 
 (O.S.) Are you dead or alive? 
 (O.S.) Brian? 
 Dead. 
 (O.S.) (sarcastic) Obviously! 
 
 Man or woman? 
 Man. 
 Real or fictional. 
 Real. 
 Ted Bundy. 
 What a guess! 
 Doesn't count, she's disqualified. 
 Why? 
 Because you've been living with him, and his thesis for the last year and a half. (beat) He's probably been researching Ted Bundy all week. 
 Carl, you are the world's worst loser! 
 Any word from that gallery? 
 Not yet. 
 Nervous? 
 ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries. 
 (nods toward Brian) You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave? 
 ...Soon as he finishes his thesis. 
 Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now. 
 Yeah, well Brian's got 'til the end of the summer, then I'm outta here. 
 I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND. 
 Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em... (does a valley- girl/beach bunny) Like fer shurr! 
 I'm talking about the mind and culpability of a serial killer. Someone who has no ability to distinguish between right and wrong should not be imprisoned, let alone executed. 
 Oh, here we go again. Let's just lay it all at the altar of misfiring synapses, amok biochemicals and horrendous childhoods. 
 Look, it's a fact, most of these people suffer from a severe chemical brain imbalance. (beat) That enough Tequila? 
 Probably not... 
 (to Eric) The answer is research and treatment under hospital supervised conditions, not the electric chair! 
 Yeah, until it's your mother's head they find in the refrigerator. 
 Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back. 
 Thank god! 
 (sarcastic to Carrie) Ha, ha. 
 Yeah, but it'd sure make you feel better, wouldn't it? 
 No, it wouldn't make me feel better. 
 ...Looking for this? 
 (to Brian) If I have to listen to one more "tweed" talk about his dissertation, I'm going to throw up. 
 (to Brian) Label it anyway you want, the bottom line is these people are evil, plain and simple. 
 (continuing with Eric) Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake. 
 Who do I have to blow to get out of here? 
 (reconsiders) A... I gotta go. 
 (O.S.) ...Be right there. 
 (from beneath his shadowy brim...) The Antichrist'll be a woman, in a man's body. Seven heads and seven tails. 
 
 Early, you are so sweet. 
 I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes. 
 Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting. 
 The party? 
 The warehouse. I'm not that drunk. 
 It was definitely the high point of the evening. 
 (getting excited) Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral. 
 Mmm... I love it when you talk like that. 
 You thirsty Lucy? 
 Bet that feels good, don't it? 
 Now if that ain't Momma's little angel. 
 (O.S.) ...two more victims last night, when a twenty pound rock smashed through the windshield of their car... 
 This was the third such attack in the past month and while an extensive police operation is underway... no arrests have yet been made. 
 Early... 
 Have a good one. 
 Oh... I forgot to tell you, Mr. Diebold was by again yesterday. 
 He said, if he ain't got the rest of his money by the end of the month, he's gonna "kick us the... (spells the word fuck to avoid saying it) F-U-C-K outta here." 
 You gonna talk to him? 
 Suppose he hears me inside? 
 I picked up some Chinese. Did you hear from the gallery? 
 (tentative) You got your slides back. 
 Yeah, same old shit. Too graphic... not suitable for mass consumption... one of those... I forget. Who cares. 
 Christ Brian I'm dying here... you are too, you just don't know it yet. You're too busy working on that damned thesis... And, thing is... when you finally do finish it, it's just gonna get filed away on some shelf at the University Library... then what? 
 (continues) I thought you wanted to be a writer. 
 (quietly) ...I do. 
 Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can. 
 Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we... 
 No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late. 
 ...just like that? 
 Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean. 
 That's half the kick anyway. Doing something you've never done before. Experiencing something... different. Something... unpredictable. 
 ...These are great. 
 She's not here. 
 Social call. 
 You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there. 
 (swallows a hiccup) Yeah... Well you never have been 'treated right'... Have you? (hiccup) Your father was pickin' on you when he threw you out of the house for stealing the tires off his truck. The Marines misunderstood you when they gave you that dishonorable discharge. 
 (hiccup) ...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day... 
 That girlfriend of yours ain't much for housekeeping, is she. 
 What are you talking about? You know you can't leave the state. (hiccup) What you can do is get a job. 
 You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp. 
 ...Janitor's job. 
 Hey, I don't give two shits about what you want or don't want... I'm telling you to be there Friday, three o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be here for dinner. You understand? 
 CARRIE'S POV 
 Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you. 
 Thanks. What are you doing? 
 Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing. 
 So how's it going? 
 ...I think it's the best stuff I've done. 
 ...and I think I know why. 
 Why? 
 Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger. 
 (sarcastic) This mean your finally going to finish your thesis? 
 Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together. 
 A book on the warehouse murders? 
 A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it. 
 What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California. (pause) "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean." 
 It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you. 
 We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out. 
 ...It's either the best idea I've had in a long time... or there's way too much MSG in this stuff. 
 (shouts) Hold on a minute there boy! 
 Goddamit, you're gonna settle up that rent here and now. 
 I've had it with your bullshit boy. I want my money. 
 (hollering) You sonofabitch! Come back here! 
 That's it! You tell him... I want you both the fuck out of here by Sunday or I'm gonna call the Police. 
 ...You won't be laughing come Sunday little girl. 
 Elvis! Get the fuck off him! 
 You know, they say one of these days... 
 (sarcastic) ...the whole thing's going to slide into the ocean... Yeah, I know. 
 "Looking for someone to take turns at the wheel and share expenses... on a week long cross country blue- highways tour of historic murder sites..." (beat) You gotta be kidding. Who in their right mind would want to do that? 
 ...I would. 
 (watching Brian walk away) Like I said... 
 (points down the hall) First door on the left. 
 Early? 
 Early? You down there? 
 Almost. 
 Early... 
 Tell me more about California. 
 I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here. 
 What'll we do out there? 
 You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind. 
 Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready. 
 What did he sound like on the phone? 
 Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.' 
 (grins) I like that. 
 I still think we should have met them first. 
 Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember? 
 Please God, we're gonna be stuck with these people for a week, don't let them be as boring as Brian's friends. Anything... but that. 
 Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance." (quotes from the movie) "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!" 
 Funny, very funny. 
 (quoting again) "Aintry? This river don't go to Aintry." 
 We shouldn't be doin' this, Early. You leavin' the state, ridin' around with strangers... besides, what kinda people would want to stop at places where other people was murdered. 
 What if they're dangerous? 
 Early Grayce! 
 (changes subject) Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold? 
 EARLY'S POV 
 Early! 
 
 You've got to be kidding me, they look like Okies! 
 Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around. 
 Lighten up... 
 Geez, they look kinda weird. 
 How many times you gonna tell me that? 
 Hi I'm Brian... Early, and you must be Adele. 
 Let me help you. 
 Hi, I'm Adele. 
 (reserved) Carrie. 
 (shyly) I like your hair. 
 ...Pardon? 
 ...I said, I like your hair. 
 ...Thank you. 
 Tight fit. 
 
 Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early. 
 Brian. 
 It's because of what he read in a book once... That folks needin' breakfast is a myth, or whatever, put out by those cereal people. 
 
 So what do you do Early? 
 One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... (beat) Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over... 
 Karma. 
 What? 
 Karma... (beat) You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you. 
 That French ain't it? 
 So Adele, did Early happen to mention the places we'll be stopping at? 
 (to Carrie) Are you takin' the pictures? 
 (surprised) ...Yeah. 
 Is it hard to learn? 
 Not really. 
 That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed. 
 What happened? 
 Who are you? 
 His Parole Officer. 
 Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy? 
 Could be. 
 Where would we find him? 
 Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas. 
 Without his car? 
 What about the owner of the house... (reads from note pad) ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be? 
 No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this. 
 (O.S.) Jesus Christ! 
 ...Diebold? 
 ...That'd be my guess. 
 Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger. 
 Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems. 
 Thank you. 
 How much do I owe you? 
 (embarrassed) Guess I don't know the first thing about cameras. 
 Well, the first thing... is you need film. Preferably black and white. 
 You wouldn't have any color film, would ya? 
 ...Yeah, sure. 
 I like things in color, pink, purple, and red. I dunno, black and white is kinda... boring. 
 You just aim and press the button. 
 Look, Pigeon Forge! 
 ADELE'S POV 
 I've heard of that! It's where Dolly Parton has her park. "Dollywood". I just think that's so clever. Hollywood. Dollywood. Get it? 
 Early, can we stop there... just for a little while. 
 (O.S.) ...I've always wanted to go there... It could be such fun. 
 The Novaks are all gone but the fence that Michael Zaruba was hired to put up is still here. 
 The Novaks embraced the young drifter as one of their own. 
 Hey you two. 
 Give me a smile now. 
 (continues into tape recorder) Neighbors said he was a quiet young man, who was often seen pushing the children on the swing set. 
 (continuing) Everything was fine until the day the family ran out of work for Michael, and had to ask him to leave. 
 Sorry, Early... Could you step out the way, for a second? 
 The first one to die was the nine year old daughter... 
 Hello. 
 ...My name's Brian, what's yours? 
 ...Could I speak to your parents? 
 (rudely) Pa! There's more of them. 
 (friendly) Hi, my name is Brian Kessler. 
 (continues -- less confident) I'm a writer, I'm working on a book about famous murderers. 
 ...I'm sure you're aware that this is the Novak house... 
 (corrects himself) ...I mean, this was the Novak house... (pause) With your permission I'd like to come in and photograph... 
 (muttering) Goddamned ghouls... 
 (upset) We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes... 
 Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay. 
 It's okay... okay? 
 (continuing on the heel of the kiss) ...That house is part of American history now, whether he likes it or not. 
 CARRIE'S POV 
 (studying his map) Well we've come three hundred miles so far. Not a bad day's haul. 
 You got any family or friends in California, Early? 
 (O.S.) No. 
 (O.S.) Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie? 
 (O.S.) No. 
 ...Well, least we got each other. That's somethin'. 
 (to Carrie) Sweet dreams. 
 (spits out a mouthful of water) You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced? 
 (reading notes) He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him. 
 Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock? 
 (O.S.) Bitch, bitch, bitch! 
 (under her breath) Up yours. 
 I heard that. 
 (O.S.) ...heard that too. 
 (O.S.) Early, sing me a song. 
 (laughs) Hey can we go to that Chinese restaurant when we get to Los Angeles? You know, to see all them famous footprints? 
 
 (O.S.) Look Carrie, we're gonna be stuck with these people for a week... 
 ...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all. 
 You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else. 
 Carrie. 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 Pretty smooth how he stiffed us on dinner? 
 He didn't stiff us. He paid for the gas remember. 
 I'm telling you he's nearly broke and we're going to end up paying for those two. 
 You finished? 
 ...Um, maybe... maybe not. 
 ...Um... Funky fucking sock. 
 ...and what's with that hair? Is that grease or motor oil or what? 
 ...you believe that tattoo? Looks like he had another girls name there and carved it out. 
 ...and that body odor. 
 Morning... 
 Where's Adele? 
 Breakfast? 
 Ah sir... sir. 
 (concerned) We ah... don't have a liquor license here. So I'm afraid... 
 (at a loss for words) You cut your hair. 
 Early cut it. (smiles at Early) ...Once he gets an idea in his head there's no holding him back. 
 Nice job Early. 
 No, thanks, I can manage. 
 (O.S.) All set? 
 (startled) Fuck! 
 Take your time. 
 It's just a work in progress, kinda rough. 
 Who? 
 Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred. 
!! 
 He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down. 
 
 
 
 You dropped this. 
 Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day. 
 I guess it's your turn to pay Early. 
 
 
 I used to smoke before I met Early. But he broke me of that. 
 Broke you? 
 Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor. 
 So you don't do any of those things. 
 Better not, or Early'd whip me. 
 (back to Adele) He whips you? 
 (O.S.) Only when I deserve it. 
 That bad? 
 (to Carrie) Comes to twenty eight dollars. 
 Talk to him. 
 ...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before? 
 I haven't... I'm a fast learner. 
 Dahlia, no. 
 Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society. 
 I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him. 
 Yeah. 
 (amused) Sure. 
 (into tape) Early Grayce, June twenty third. 
 (to Carrie) You lose! 
 (to Early) I suppose anything's possible. 
 EARLY'S POV 
 BOWLING & MUSIC" 
 (O.S.) I can hold my own... 
 
 (O.S.) Hey Minnesota Fats! 
 (sarcastic) Don't forget your key. 
 Why'd I open my big mouth? 
 (to Adele) Why didn't you go with them? 
 I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking. 
 How'd you meet Early? 
 (grins) I was hitchhiking' one day and he picked me up. At first I wasn't gonna get in on account of his car was in such sorry shape. I said, "I ain't never seen a white man drivin' a car like this." 
 (continues) An' he said right back, "You shouldn't judge by appearances little lady... this vehicle might just be a flying saucer disguised as a car, for all you know." 
 Well, I got in and we got to talkin', and the next thing I know, I'd moved in with him in this old trailer. (beat) Hey! Wouldn't it be something if we all ended up sharing a house together in California? 
 
 You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want? 
 You can? 
 By the way, I'm not much of a pool player. 
 Yeah? 
 Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me? 
 How do you get your cigarette to stay there like that. 
 I'm cool. 
 Could I try that? 
 What's this? 
 It's a portfolio of my work. 
 Your pictures. Can I see 'em? 
 Sure. 
 Jesus! 
 You took this picture? 
 Took 'em all. 
 That's me. 
 No it is not! 
 Hold still. 
 Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week. 
 (suddenly serious) You shouldn't let him do that to you... 
 Do what? 
 Adele... are you serious? 
 (defensive) You think Early's bad to me, don't you? 
 Yeah. 
 Well... You're wrong. I ain't saying Early ain't never hit me... but he never hurt me. 
 (continues) ...When I was fourteen years old three boys raped me in the back of a truck, and beat me so bad I was in bed for almost four months... (beat) ...I feel safe with Early, most the time he treats me pretty good. And I know he wouldn't let nothin' like that ever happen to me again... 
 Hey, that ain't so bad now. 
 Maybe when you grow up a little sonny. 
 These aren't Lucky Lager, I ordered Lucky Lager. 
 Sorry honey, 'ain't nothin Lucky around here. 
 What did you say to her city boy! 
 Nothing, I jus... 
 (cuts him off) What's a jism gargling cum drunk fairy like you looking at a pretty girl like that for anyway? 
 This yur' boyfriend? 
 (dumbfounded) What? 
 (to Early) Hey Asshole! 
 They don't stock it here Early. 
 (to Early, furious) Why you fuckin'... 
 Sorry about that, he's always causing trouble. 
 These are on the house. 
 My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once. 
 (interrupting) What's Early been in jail for? 
 (reluctantly) Carryin' a gun. 
 ...Anything else? 
 An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said. 
 Jeez... Adele! 
 I'd better be goin'. It's late. 
 Great. 
 Last one. 
 No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there. 
 What were you "swinging a sickle" for? 
 Gotta see a man about a mule... What's wrong? 
 The same thing that's been "wrong" the whole trip. Your good buddy Early. 
 Who said he's my good buddy? 
 You sure been acting like you were... (redneck accent) ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang. 
 Hey come on, you two were drinking too... so what's the big deal. 
 Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her. 
 How do you know that? 
 She told me... (adding) ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail? 
 
 Yeah, for stealing a car. Aaahhhh. 
 (O.S.) Bullshit! 
 ...He told her it was for carrying a gun, but the truth could be murder for all we know. 
 
 Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state. 
 Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian! 
 (sarcastically) Of course! The accent, the clothes, and those table manners!... He's got to be a mass murderer! (pause) What else could he be? 
 You know, it wouldn't even surprise me if he turned out to be... a Republican! 
 Goddamnit!... my fucking toe! 
 (to Brian inside room) Try not to lose consciousness 'til I get back. 
 ...Brian hurt his foot. 
 (tenuous) No. 
 I gotta get back before this ice melts. 
 No, never. Excuse me. 
 My daddy always took sauerkraut juice and tobasco sauce for a hangover, mixed in one egg not two, and some tomato juice... 
 I'm okay, thanks. 
 What! What! 
 What is it? 
 Look again! 
 Boys'll be boys. 
 You know any tricks? 
 You wanna learn some? 
 (pissed off) Siesta. 
 
 What's that? 
 A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything. 
 FLASH!! FLASH!! 
 (speaks into his small hand held tape recorder) His mother had him working in here before he was eight years old... killing animals with a sledgehammer that was bigger than he was. 
 When she was pissed at him, she'd beat the shit out of him and lock him in here overnight... 
 (continuing) ...Eventually the boy wakes up one morning, picks up that sledgehammer and starts hurting back. 
 FLASH!! FLASH!! 
 There's more... 
 I'm finished. 
 Look... I know you're pissed off about the gun, and I don't blame you... 
 Brian, I'm not pissed off. God damm it, turn that thing off. 
 I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you? 
 Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? (pause) But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos. 
 I can't believe I agreed to do this. 
 Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too. 
 Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference. 
 Brian I want him out of our car! 
 Why, what did he do? 
 Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do! 
 Twenty dollars in the tank and a carton of cigarettes. 
 ...the ex-mental patient with a history of arrests is still at large... 
 Here's your cigarettes... 
 ...And change. Better be careful, looks like a bad one coming. Where you headin'? 
 California. 
 Hear it never rains there. Must be nice. 
 ...we would like to repeat... 
 ...there is a nationwide manhunt for... 
 (O.S.) ...is believed responsible for the murders of his landlord John Diebold... 
 ...of the fatal stabbing and robbery of Mr. Joseph Davies Robbins... 
 If you see this man... 
 (O.S.) ...call your local police or FBI... 
 Early, what're you doin'? 
 (very scared) Walter Livesy. 
 Not so good. You sure you have to? 
 Early, just think... 
 Adele, what are you doing back here? 
 ...Lost my purse... Could you help me look for it? It's probably under the seat. 
 (nervous shake) Vernon, Florida. 
 Turkey mostly. 
 ...Mind if I hold that Bible? 
 No sir. 
 What was that? 
 Carrie, what's wrong? (to Early) Early, we went through this already, you have to leave. 
 (to Early) What happened back there? 
 He shot him in the head... oh God! 
 (raising her voice) He did not, you liar. Take that back. 
 He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane. 
 It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth... 
 I don't know, they didn't speak too good English. 
 
 (quietly) How many people have you killed Early? 
 
 None. 
 
 (unconvincingly) If you say so. 
 
 What are you getting at? 
 (nervously mimes the same) ...Ha. 
 (recollecting to himself) ...way too much MSG. 
 Smile. 
 Forget about it, doesn't matter. 
 
 Can I just wait here? 
 This is called walk the dog. 
 CARRIE'S POV 
 Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back. 
 They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here. 
 CARRIE'S POV 
 
 (O.S.) This is one of my favorites... rock the cradle. 
 ...They asked them just before they were executed why they did it. They said "to be famous." (beat) Why do you do it? 
 We both know you didn't have to kill that gas station attendant. 
 You wanted to. (beat) Why? 
 It make you feel good? Powerful? (Flash!) Superior, what? Come on Early, tell me something. (Flash!) Were you angry? 
 (tentative) Who are you angry with Early... your mother, your father? 
 Adele, listen to me... Early's sick; he should be in a hospital. 
 (shouting over the music) The police are after him, he's a murderer! 
 (uncertain) ...That's not true. 
 (shouting) What? 
 (shouting back) That's not true! 
 
 Let's take a look. 
 I'll call in the plate. 
 (shouting) ...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man. 
 (defensive) Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend. 
 Please don't say anything Carrie. 
 We got a match, I'll call for back up. 
 All right ladies, I want both of you to slowly step away from the ca... 
 
 Officer needs help, shots fired, six Adam five, one eighty-seven, suspects wanted in multiple murders. Location unknown, last seen... 
 No, no, I can't. 
 ...Don't do it. Early, look at him, look at his face. That's not your father. 
 (empty) ...thank you. 
 (hesitantly, she admits) ...I don't know. 
 He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch! 
 Carrie... stop it. 
 (explodes) What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real! 
 Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up! 
 ...I luv' cactuses 'cos they're so strong. Don't need much care really. 
 BRIAN'S POV 
 (far away) ...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before. 
 (watching the house) Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else. 
 BRIAN'S POV 
 ...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years. 
 Adele for god sake please lis... 
 (she glances over to Brian) There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that. 
 MRS. MUSGRAVE (to herself) It's just like in that dream I had. If only I had seen their faces. 
 (tries to cheer Mrs. Musgrave up) You've got beautiful cactuses here, I just love 'em. My momma used to keep a garden. 
 (sorry for her) She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen. 
 MRS. MUSGRAVE (lying) ...I'm a widow. 
 MR. MUSGRAVE (excited) Is that you Peaches? Come, you must see Saturn tonight. The rings are sensational! 
 EARLY'S POV 
 MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.) My oh my, this is quite rare, quite rare indeed. Come have a look... 
 MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.) Peaches? 
 (whispers to Carrie) You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you. 
 I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work. 
 Then try again, (it's our only chance.) 
 (O.S.) Early? 
 (excited) Early, Mrs. Musgrave has the most beautiful little guest house out back and... well, no one's stayin' in it... it's just empty. And she said if me and you wanted to, well maybe we... 
 (O.S.) You're right Early... 
 ...It is me. Do you like it? 
 Go on now... please. 
 (in a whisper) ...Call me. 
 Early! Stop!! 
 I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people. 
 Carrie, watch for Early. 
 What are you going to do? 
 I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free. 
 What about you? 
 I don't know. 
 Can you lift it again? Just lift it, hurry. 
 What happened to Adele? 
 (desperate) Early, don't. 
 I'll do whatever you want. You want me to go with you, I'll go with you. Just don't kill him. 
 
 (not looking at him) No. 
 (confused) ...You're hurting me... 
 (explodes) You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me. 
 ...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face. 
 MRS. MUSGRAVE He's pulled out all the lines. The nearest phone is twenty miles east of here. 
 Which way did they go? 
 MRS. MUSGRAVE (pointing) He took the fire road. 
 Take your car and get to that phone. Call the police.

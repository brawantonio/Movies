 This is my Fredricksburg house and my grandma Ruth playing with my skateboard ramp. It's a Tony Hawk jump ramp. 
 I forgot what I was going to say. 
 This is me at my second birthday party with my mom and my dad. That's my cake. 
 8/18/06   2. 
 Where's your gun? 
 Yeah, where is your gun? 
 I'm assuming that there are no bad guys in this room. Isn't that right? I mean, are you guys good guys or bad guys? 
! 
 Right. So why would I have brought my gun to a room full of good guys? 
 What's that picture? 
 This is me and my dad playing Battleship at my dad's apartment. 
 What is a battleship? 
 (abruptly) My parents are divorced. 
 8/18/06    3. 
 So, who's that in that picture up on top? 
 That's my fish, his name is Jaws and he's a really mean fish. 
 My mommy is a Think Tank worker and she is really, really smart. She went to two colleges and has three computers. 
 This is the day that my daddy says is the happiest day of his life. 
 Really. His happiest day! Can you tell us about that day, Mr. Fleury? 
 8/18/06   4. 
 I sure can. That was December 4th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of Kevin's mom's tummy. And we waited and waited but he wouldn't come and we kept waiting and finally the doctor said `OK...he's not gonna come out on his own so we got to go get him.' And well, 
 Go for it. 
 Then what happened? 
 What did they do? 
 They started to pull and pull and pull... they had something in there and it started coming and they were pulling and the doctor all of the sudden said "STOP!" 
 8/18/06   5. 
 8/18/06   6. 
 How are you today, Sergeant? 
 Sun is shining. Wind is blowing. How bad can I be doing? 
 I like that, "Sun is shining..." 
 8/18/06   7. 
 (O.C.) Hang up the phone. If they're not ready now, no words will change it. 
 
! 
 STEP IT UP NOW! (back the Batter) Ready for my knuckle-curve? 
 TAG UP! WAIT `TIL SHE CATCHES IT- 
 (spins, points up at the ball) 
 -COMIN' HOME! 
 8/18/06   8. 
 Don't stop watching the game. 
 You have a copy of the duty rost- 
 8/18/06   9. 
 (O.C.) I said keep watching the game. 
 
! 
! 
 (accented English) COME TO ME! FOLLOW ME! 
 8/18/06   10. 
 8/18/06   11. 
 (O.C.) Our Time is not a peaceful one. God has left it to us to make it so. 
 (surprised) Fran? 
 8/18/06   12. 
 (O.S.) You getting this yet? 
 Hey, I'm at Kevin's school. What's goin' on? 
 (O.S.) I'm sorry, Brother. (beat) Riyadh. Many Dead. 
 Where exactly? 
 (O.S.) The Al-Rahmah Western Housing Compound. Oil Company employees. Hit a company picnic. 
 How? 
 (O.S.) Big. Broad daylight. Blew up a softball game. (tears) Kids, Brother. 
 Dad? 
 When? 
 (O.S.) Just went off -- twenty minutes ago. Two bombers. A Shooter crew as diversion...it's just awful. 
 Fran, I'm rollin' right now. Let me call you back: I gotta ring bells 
 8/18/06   13. 
 (O.S.) Go. I'll be here. 
 Son, I gotta go to work. 
 We're gonna do ceramics... 
 I gotta go to work... 
 (points to the phone) Who was that? 
 Big Fran -- you remember him? 
 (beat, thinking) Uncle Fran? Put peanuts in his Coke so he could drink and eat all at the same time? 
 (smile) Where he's from in South Carolina that's called fine-dining, Bud. 
 What happened? 
 (beat) Something bad. 
 (impression of his Dad) `Lotta bad people out there...' 
 (smiles, already homesick) I love you. 
 You gonna go see him? 
 8/18/06   14. 
 I'm gonna try... 
 Where's your husband going? 
 Ex-husband, and God knows. 
 8/18/06   15. 
 (O.C.) (immediately behind) Fran. You gotta stand Big Man... 
 Rex, how old were you when your hat was that small? 
 You gotta stand, Big Man. 
 We need to get everyone back, then get all their- 
 8/18/06   16. 
 It was... I don't know what time it was... the dishwasher's broken...I was waiting for the dishwasher... The doorbell rang - I thought it was... it wasn't the dishwasher guy...It wasn't. It wasn't. 
 Glenda, I want you to look at me. 
 FLEURY (CONT'D) Please... I'm going to take care of this. Whoever did this... I give you my word. Whoever did this will pay. I can't change this, but I can promise you that I will make someone pay for this. 
 8/18/06    17. 
 ...1 hour ago: blasts in Saudi Arabia, in or around the `Al- Rahmah' western housing complex near Riyadh. More than 100 feared dead, including children. The Saudi Foreign Minister has released a statement calling this a `heinous act possibly committed by foreigners...' 
 ...homes to thousands of Westerners and other non-Saudis who work in the Kingdom, there have been several attacks on these compounds in the last five years. As such, they have become very tight in terms of security, with both the Saudi National Guard and police taking command. 
 
 Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+ injured. The target was a softball game. Rumor is the Killers wore Saudi police uniforms. (beat) Special Agent Fran Manner was killed. 
 8/18/06     18. 
 From the craters, looks like they used a High Explosive... possibly military grade: can't fit that much TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4: they could get it. The third there, God knows...that crater looks like a plane dropped a 500-pounder... 
 Obviously a secondary blast after the initial devices used to lure first responders to the scene. Don't know anything about where or what it was yet. 
 This is how they do it. 
 8/18/06   19. 
 ADAM   LEAVITT I already know   the answer, but any chance in Hell   we get to go over there, use our   hands? 
 If you already know the answer Adam, why ask the question? 
 We're not seeing this kind of planning and execution anywhere else...these ain't hot-wired artillery shells waiting for Humvees to roll by. (pointing at the screens) These hits are coordinated: planning, timing, and big, broad- daylight balls- 
 (almost trance-studying the images) Yeah, So... did they all happen during daylight? 
 #1 Yes. At least the first parts of the attacks. 
 We had two others...North of Riyadh and the oil thing. What was that? 
 The Refinery... Ras Tenura Refinery. 
 Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing: daylight, suicide bombers. Right? (MORE) 
 8/18/06   20. 
 Yup. 
 This is not new in concept. It is new in scope. It's bigger. Very sophisticated. Command and control was flawless. They found the largest kill zone they could and they did it... they did it by being patient. 
 Any rumors or confirmations of uniforms being used in the other two attacks? 
 #1 (from memory) No. I know this is the first for that. 
 That's `worst case scenario' if you're still asking for my stab, Sir. A crew who can build bombs this big, with this level of eyes- on control and detonation coordination... has access to Saudi uniforms now...I mean...Baby Jesus. 
 Anyone take credit? 
 Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin- Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq. Now he seems to have come home. He's clearly becoming increasingly active... 
 If it is Hamza, he's definitely turning up the volume over there. (MORE) 
 8/18/06   21. 
 They can't afford to appear as if they are losing any kind of control. They lose control over their country, their people...then they risk losing control over the oil. They won't let us in. No way. 
 From the State Department, one hour ago: `We are in agreement with the Saudi security assessment that any additional American presence on Kingdom soil represents reckless risk. Therefore it is the Secretary of State's position that only after the situation has been evaluated and contained, should the Federal Bureau of Investigation activate Rapid Deployment.' (folding the memo) The National Security Advisor and the Attorney General agreed. (beat) I'm going to get us access. Keep your go bags hot. It's gonna come fast. 
 (beat) Well... I guess he's gonna go get us some access. (beat) How's he gonna do that? 
 8/18/06   22. 
 Killing those I saw responsible. 
 (puzzled, angry) I don't understand. 
 -that is not a crime- 
 It's not. 
 8/18/06   23. 
 I do not. 
 I am not my brother. 
 I am NOT my brother! 
 Uniforms? 
 I sweat. I'll say it again because it is true. I need more uniforms because I must change during shifts...look at my shirts. 
 8/18/06     24. 
 -then look at my jackets. Please. Permanent stains...no matter how many times they're cleaned... 
 8/18/06   25. 
 I love my country. 
 I love my country... 
 Everyone's terrified, so nothing moves. Paralysis. You and your team aren't going anywhere. (beat) And this meeting is just a circle- jerk, Ronnie: Attorney General Young's going to go through the motions because protocol says we get an appeal. We'll be on record, but expect nothing more. 
 8/18/06   26. 
 (beat) Yeah, sure. No problem. 
 (re: Janet) What about Agent Mayes? 
 Ask her. 
 (to Janet) What about you? 
 I'll be fine. 
 I apologize if we're late- 
 They were early. 
 You know Special Agent Fleury? 
 I do. 
 8/18/06    27. 
 This is agent Janet Mayes, she's one of our Arabic experts. 
 OK. The latest. 
 Two suicide bombers. Rumors they were dressed as Saudi Police. We believe this is the work of Saudi terrorist named Abu Hamza. 
 Go on. 
 A Shooter crew served as distraction. After the initial attack there was a lull to allow Saudi Emergency Teams...and our own attaches...to collect. Then a secondary blast was triggered, aimed at those first responders. So they targeted families and rescuers with one attack. (mildly sarcastic:) I think that's a clear signal that their definition of `Enemy' is expanding. 
 My God. 
 Let us never forget how cheap life is over there. Now...I have seven minutes before my next meeting, so who's talking first? (to Fleury and Grace, slow like a Kindergarten teacher:) You two digested the memo? 
 8/18/06   28. 
 I'll go first if that's okay Maricella? (off her `yeah, sure' nod) First, I'm sorry about Fran Manner. 
 As we are about Rex Burr. 
 I met with Prince Thamer at the Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after I heard this morning's news. After speaking with Thamer, I advised we withhold additional US personnel because a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current US personnel. More boots on Saudi soil make an already combustible situation more so. I know that's not the answer you want, but... 
 My two cents: The Saudis haven't asked for FBI help. Sounds like they've done just the opposite. If we force the issue, that could further anger an utterly important ally that shares a 1000-mile long border with Iraq. 
 (to Grace and Fleury) It's all rock-solid logic. 
 (beat) We would just like to be on record as saying we think we should go 
- 
 That's not going to happen 
 8/18/06   29. 
 Sir, how would you imagine it looks viewed through an FBI agents eyes? 
 Pardon me? 
 I'm interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes. 
 It's some variation on vengeance... When one of your own is killed, Agents lose their analytical powers - kind of a greatest strength, greatest weakness thing... 
 If I wanted vengeance, I'd have whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's ear right when we walked in. (beat) 
 What's the distinction? 
 8/18/06   30. 
 To call this massacre an act of terrorism... that implies a specific political agenda. To me, these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic- more like Charles Manson than Osama Bin Laden... 
 (beat, fuck it: Go) Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this war, so a new, zero-sum phase has begun: if you won't join us, we'll let loose the truly talented Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause an exodus, a rebellion, both. Because the Royal Family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer. 
 When she says talented, she's not talking about the walking-bombs who can sneak past any and all security, nor the hi-jackers tough enough to take an airliner. We're talking about the Man who teaches them how... 
 --the operational commander who organizes, trains, plans, encourages. That is who we're fighting. 
 If we don't get inside Saudi Arabia within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for Al-Rahmah. None. 
 8/18/06   31. 
 Okay. I believe it all. So doesn't your team in that country represent the kind of target one of these `Masters' would die for? Trade ten of their own for one of you? 
 To not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.' 
 (chuckle) That was spirited... let's all thank God Special Agent Fleury doesn't make policy decisions. He'd turn the FBI into Patton's Third Army. 
 (to Fleury) I see the look in your eyes. That look is trouble: old school, play ground shit, vengeance... 
 8/18/06   32. 
 It's not vengeance. 
 It ain't justice. It's stronger. We've all been there. I have. Vengeance is always dirty, Ronnie. 
 I just can't sit this out. I can't watch this not get dealt with. Not again. (a beat...) Know what my high school football coach used to say to me? 
 What? 
 "HIT SOMETHING." All night long, Coach Bailey would scream "HIT SOMETHING." Every play. 
 That's good coaching. 
 I'm fixing to go hit something, boss. You with me? 
 How you gonna do it? 
 The Saudis covet good PR as much as their Oil: 15 of 19 hijackers on 9- 11 means most Americans will never stop asking if that Saudi Oil is worth it. It's all about press. 
 Few more moves and it's Total War, Ronnie. The only time Treason is palatable is when it's done righteously and completely... 
 Oh, I'm in...Not a question. I'm definitely going. 
 8/18/06   33. 
 What's your take? 
 Looks like every overthrow in history: once the guys with the guns are no longer trustworthy, the government's days are numbered. 
 White House call you with a spin? 
 You kidding? We don't talk since I broke the Vice President's guy cooking dirty intel on Iran. They hate me. What's up, Fleury? 
 How hard you gonna hit the Royal Family in your column tomorrow? 
 With a sledgehammer. 
 With the bombings? Or other things... 
 What's "other" than the bombings? 
 I know you're tracking Al Haramain. 
 Is that what you want to talk about? Saudi officials making donations that end up... What? Blowing up trains in Paris? Buses in London? 
 Sometimes. Seems that just might happen. (MORE) 
 8/18/06   34. 
 Murder...Hookers...Houston? Can I take some notes? 
 I'm not saying that. 
 Are you saying anything? 
 I need a favor. 
 I don't do favors, Ronnie. 
 When it's real and it will be real... I'll come to you with what we have first. It's yours. Exclusive. 
 OK. 
 You call Thamer at the Embassy. Tell him that the FBI is getting real close to laying out some major Saudi VIP indictments relating to newly uncovered charity financing out of a Boston investment firm. We're gonna freeze a lot of Saudi cash and roll out some major embarrassment. 
 Can I mention Houston? 
 It's a free world, baby. Ask him to comment. 
 He won't. 
 8/18/06   35. 
 Tell him that I'm running the investigation. 
 OK. 
 Tell him that I'm not the nicest kid on the block. 
 That would be accurate. 
 I want fifteen minutes with him tonight. 
 Wow. OK. And I get what? 
 I come to you first. No one else. 
 What's really going on here, Ronnie? You going strong over Fran Manner? 
 I'm just trying to do my job, Elaine. That's it. Call Thamer. 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Get back in. 
 8/18/06   36. 
 Too many people we both know were at the bar. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness. 
 I had an interesting conversation with a reporter from the Post. 
 She can be a bit of an exaggerator... I'm sure things were somewhat over-stated. I see myself as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just need a little cooperation, that's all. 
 What kind of cooperation?? 
 Full cooperation: my Team cleared to land at Prince Sultan Air Base. Tomorrow. We want to help in a very muscular way, quickly. 
 Next month would be as soon as... 
 This goes one of two ways. First: The FBI with the White House go on the kind of aggressive PR "Saudi Royal Family Decaying Monarchy" bender that just can't help but hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care how many Chinese are lined up to buy the oil. You know it's gonna hurt. 
 My family is not decaying- 
 8/18/06   37. 
 And then we bring the hammer down hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we got direct links from Riyadh - two wives donating ten million to three Arab-American cultural centers in Boston. Then what gets kind of not- funny is how some of that cash found its way to Jakarta and some Mosques that have these training camps built right next to them. It's kinda funny... you got little kids playing over here, and some not so little kids playing with guns over here. That's kinda odd. 
 You have no proof of this. 
 We're getting there, Sir. And I haven't even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston. This is big. It is real. And I know you only care so much about public American opinion, Sir. But the story will be covered... Big... 
 What is your point? 
 Last I heard, 112 people lost their lives in your country. One of them was a good friend of mine. I want in and I want in immediately. 
 8/18/06   38. 
 Define "immediately." 
 Right now immediately. 
 If your phone doesn't work international, you can borrow mine. 
 FLEURY (CONT'D) I'll just be right out here. 
 (trying to maintain cool) We cannot allow 100 agents- 
 -4. With a 25-man security detail- 
 -even 25 more armed Americans could spark rebellion- 
 That's too bad. 
 Saudi Security. That's non negotiable. You cannot bring guns into the Kingdom. 
 Men in Saudi Police uniforms are why we're talking now. 
 They would be hand picked. 
 8/18/06   39. 
 Whose hands? 
 Mine. 
 If anything happens to me or my team... It's on you. Understood? 
 Cool it with the John Wayne, Mr. Fleury. 
 -seven-day or work-week? 
 Work week. Five days. No guns. 
 8/18/06   40. 
 (O.C.) Just in time. 
 HAYTHAM'S FATHER What happened? 
 You haven't heard about the attack? 
 HAYTHAM'S FATHER I choose not to listen anymore. What happened to your face? 
 (beat) An attack today. 
 HAYTHAM'S FATHER Look at me. 
 8/18/06   41. 
 (beat, re: Janet) What was Fran Manner to her? 
 He taught her how to shoot, she taught him most everything else. (beat) Celebrated graduation at the IHOP in-town until some Townie called Janet something...Something not very nice. Townie didn't see Fran coming outta the Head. But he definitely felt Fran's uppercut shatter his jaw. 
 8/18/06   42. 
 Fran didn't get bounced for that? 
 SAC Fleury took care of him. 
 How? 
 If I knew how I'd be SAC Sykes. I do know the post in Riyadh was part of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran's career. 
 (beat) What did SAC Fleury whisper in your ear this morning? 
 (smart-ass smile) `Grant's age is a liability.' 
 Thanks for volunteering. 
 Actually, I didn't volunteer. 
 Thanks anyway. 
 We're going to Riyadh? 
 Yup. 
 State department said yes? 
 Nope. 
 8/18/06   43. 
 White House said yes? 
 Nope. 
 Anybody said yes? 
 Not really. 
 Are we bringing security? 
 Nope. 
 This is going to suck so bad. 
 What can four people do in five days? Really? 
 Aren't you the one who demanded to go this morning? 
 I meant the FBI. I didn't mean "me." 
 8/18/06   44. 
 Mars. 
 I'll be looked at with what I can only describe as disdain, pretty much the entire time we're on the ground... kind of like South Virginia. 
 Go easy on my kin. 
 It's a very confused culture. Extremely religious. Had nothing; wanted nothing. Sixty years ago, they hit oil. Simple religious men become trillionaires... a schizophrenic nation is born. The royal family, who we back, and everyone else. 
 8/18/06   45. 
 8/18/06   46. 
 What's going on in there? 
 (getting his bearings) I'm good. 
 Feels like you got a beast in there, Fleury. 
 (beat) I'm good 
 "Good" is 6:00 am Sunday morning when your kid climbs into your bed, buries himself into you... sun's creeping through the windows - soft. Birds and wind-chimes... that's "good." 
 I'm OK...You don't think I'm OK? 
 (small smile) I think you're not entirely clear right now. That's OK, but you got to know that. You want to go - we go. I got you, but you got to check yourself. 
 I'm checked. 
 OK. I'm just checking that you checked. 
 8/18/06   47. 
 How we doing? 
 #1 About a half hour out. 
 They gonna let us land? 
 #1 We've been talking to them about an hour or so... they know we're coming. 
 Good. 
 #1 You don't mind my asking, but what the hell you all gonna be doing down there? 
 Hunting... 
 #1 Hunting...? I think of hunting, I think quail in Tennessee, deer in Pennsylvania. What kind of hunting you all gonna do in Saudi? 
 Big Game hunting. 
 8/18/06   48. 
 Heads on a swivel. 
 Special Agent Ronald Fleury. 
 We brought our own. 
 8/18/06    49. 
 Israeli stamp in my passport? 
 And I usually just toss it on the kitchen table... 
 (whispering to Leavitt) Wouldn't need the power a' prayer if there were 2 hands on the wheel. 
 110 miles per hour... How do you keep so calm? I mean, really? Is it breathing-- 
 --Shhhh.... 
 If somebody was tailing us it'd be obvious. This is just standard operating speed. 
 8/18/06    50. 
 You don't know what you missed... you should have seen him play for our Chicago Bulls. 
 You have portable lights on-scene? 
 We only have seven days: we work around the clock. 
 We're safe during the day? 
 8/18/06   51. 
 (smartass) I don't like camels. 
 Colonel, do you believe Abu Hamza was responsible for this attack? 
 Were Saudi Police involved in the attack? 
 Any word on what that third big blast was? 
 You interviewed witnesses? 
 Were any of the uniformed bombers brother-officers? 
 8/18/06   52. 
 You don't know the source of the blast, don't know if your own Officers were involved, but you won't let us work nights? 
 Good afternoon, Sir. 
 `Sunlight is indeed the most powerful disinfectant. (MORE) 
 8/18/06   53. 
... 
 Senators? Then I'd change `outmoded' to `outdated,' `echelons' to `ranks' and what in God's name is `contretemps?' These guys aren't the best and brightest- 
 -never take the Lord's name in vain in this office- 
 -but you can say `Fucking?' 
 8/18/06    54. 
 -you really want to bet? 
 I do. 
 8/18/06   55. 
 That's one of the great horrors of television: Crime scene manipulation. They say a TV camera adds pounds to actresses. Isn't that what they say? 
 Who's "they?" 
 That is what they say. Doesn't add to crime scenes. Television cameras shrink them. Misrepresent. No smells. Poor sound. Limited view. TV always makes them look smaller. You can't feel the hatred on television. 
 ...heads on a swivel, people. 
 EASY. 
 8/18/06   56. 
 What time tomorrow morning? 
 What time is sunrise? 
 That's against fire code. 
 They don't have fire codes. They don't have codes other than codes of war. They'll lock us in and dial up some kind of earth movers if they want to. You know that, Sykes. Dig a big hole and push us in. Fill it up and no one comes calling. You're in the jungle now, baby. 
 (smiling) You alright, girl? 
 Watch it, boy. 
 Just asking... 
 Unpack. 
 8/18/06   57. 
 (to himself) Saudi slow roll... 
 (on phone) Hello? 
 Hey... How are you? How's my boy? 
 We're just fine. How are you? Where are you? 
 I'm here... (quick beat) Lemme talk to my boy. 
 (O.S.) Daddy? 
 What you doing? 
 (O.S.) I'm talking to you. What are you doing right now, Daddy? Right now? 
 I'm missing you. 
 (O.S.) Where are you? 
 I'm in Saudi Arabia. 
 (O.S.) Did you see Big Fran? 
 8/18/06   58. 
 Yeah... I saw him... 
 (PAUSE) I saw him. 
 (O.S.) Is he still tall? 
 Yeah... Yeah...he's still tall. 
 (O.S.) Daddy? Are you still there? 
 Yeah, buddy. I love you. Keep your eye on your mama. Be the man. 
 (O.S.) You, too Daddy. 
 I'll call you tomorrow. I love you. 
 (O.S.) Bye, Daddy. 
. 
 8/18/06    59. 
 (big smile) You are in so much trouble. 
 Is that right? 
 For sure. I mean, I don't know how you did it. Nice work, but if you live through this, which I put at about fifty percent - if you do, your balls are gonna get stretched and beaten on. Dig that? 
 SCHMIDT (CONT'D) Damon Schmidt. State Department. I'm in charge of getting you out of here. 
 SCHMIDT (CONT'D) Don't let go of his hand first. Major disrespect. 
 8/18/06   60. 
 Nice pictures. You guys ready to go home now? 
 SCHMIDT   (CONT'D) OK. If you change   your minds, I got a plane fueled up   and ready to go - got your name all   over it... 
 SCHMIDT (CONT'D) Strap your kevlar on tight, people. 
 Slow roll... gonna be like when you go deep sea fishing in Florida and you pay seven hundred bucks for the boat and you sit in the ocean for hours and the crew jumps around and screams and points and you think your constantly about to bag a Marlin but you never do and they keep pointing and jumping and- 
 8/18/06   61. 
 Enough. 
 You're willing to die to protect your enemy? 
 What did the Prince say? 
 What rules? 
 That's not accurate-- 
 (to Fleury) How could they get more secure? 
 8/18/06   62. 
 Well, this is going well... 
 Saudi Slow Roll. 
 Good. 
 8/18/06   63. 
 How do you do that? 
 Check. 
 Don't say `good' again. 
 Bueno. 
 (to Sykes, himself) Of course we won't. 
 8/18/06   64. 
 I would have thought your primary concern was investigating a crime. 
 (to Fleury) I think it's one of those "something happens to us... his head comes off" kind of deals. (to Al-Ghazi) Is it one of those kind of deals, Colonel? 
 So, if you're not running the investigation...who is? 
 I thought the SANG were soldiers-- 
 Who is in charge of the investigation then? 
 8/18/06   65. 
 To walk through? Are you kidding me? 
 Get him over here now and let's clarify this situation. 
 There sure as hell is! I don't know what kind of game you're playing but you got the wrong guy, Colonel Al-Ghazi! That was not the deal- 
 OK. 
 8/18/06   66. 
 AL-GHAZI What witnesses? 
 I'm guessing there are a bunch of Americans, Brits... Australians? Someone must have seen something. I'm sure they're just dying to talk to you guys, seeing as how the killers were wearing your uniforms. That must be a real confidence booster for them. 
 FLEURY (CONT'D) Let me talk to them. 
: 
 There's still a couple of hundred of us living on the compound. 
 8/18/06     67. 
 Why Saudi Arabia? 
 Neither of us did anymore schooling than Electra High, Electra Texas. 
 OK. 
 And the jobs here pay twice what you'd make in Midland or the Gulf a' Mexico. Plus the house is free. 
 I call it combat pay. This place has gone Guns - Guns - Guns. 
 So has Everyone else now. 
 My girlfriends in Texas spend their combat pay on diamonds... I spent mine on a safe room. 
 (chuckles) Two nights back. Can you start one second before you knew anything was wrong? 
 We didn't really see anything. Just hit the ground and hustled to the safe room. Closed our eyes and prayed. It was so fast. So loud. 
 So you really didn't see anything. 
 I hit the deck. Horrible. 
 Not `til after. Just the screams-- 
 8/18/06   68. 
 -- the kids... they were screaming. That got me out of the house. Those kids. 
 Which kids were those? 
 The Jackson kids. Tracy Jackson next door was murdered looking out her window...front of her children. No safe room over there... (right at Al-Ghazi) Not even the Men that did this should die in front a' their babies. 
 She live with her husband? 
 Aaron. 
 (beat) If I'm facing your house, is the Jackson home to the right or left? 
 Left. 
 Mr. Aaron Jackson? 
 (re: Al-Ghazi) Get him away from me- 
 8/18/06   69. 
 -easy, Sir. He's a friend to us- 
 -I don't know either one a' you. 
 I'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of the FBI. This is Colonel Al-Ghazi with the Saudi State Police- 
 -the Police: they attacked. 
 Can I come back? 
 (too loud) WHY? 
 Your boys... 
 When my wife's jaw was shot off in front of our sons? My sons who sat with her while she bled to death? Couldn't speak because she didn't have the bottom of her face and I wasn't home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year- old had a box of band-aids in his hand when I finally got home? 
 8/18/06   70. 
 ...I won't pretend to know... 
 Kill everyone that had something to do with this. Everyone related to them. Everyone who knew them. (beat) And all you'd be doing is their recruiting for them... It's an entire generation: not small and isolated like they say. But a generation that thinks what they did to my wife, to my children, is a "calling"... 
 Up the street, there was a wreck, did you see any- 
 -notice how it wouldn't take a lot to disguise your friend (points to Al-Ghazi) as a Mexican? Think he couldn't handle crossing our deserts? Look around! 
 Aaron- 
 (explodes) -LET ME FINISH GOD DAMN YOU- 
 8/18/06   71. 
 (to Al-Ghazi) Can we tour the compound? Can we please do that? 
 He or she almost made it. 
 That's what makes this a War. 
 8/18/06   72. 
 Hit a water main? 
 (eyes on Fleury) Hole is the case. See, there's "evidence" down in that hole. You understand evidence? Little things that are "clues." Clues can be very helpful to a fella when he's trying to solve a crime. 
 Glad to hear it. So can we get in there? 
 OK. 
 8/18/06   73. 
 (to Fleury) A little high... 
 (to SANG, "Lower," in Arabic) Watt-tee... 
 Watt-tee fuck (alt: "Watt-tee hell...") is his gun doing up so high? 
 (to Al-Ghazi) Are the Shooters in-custody- 
 -dead. 
 Were any of these shooters your men? 
 No. 
 8/18/06    74. 
 They got into the compound. Somehow...took control of this vehicle. I'm guessing they didn't politely ask whoever was in this car if they could take it for a little ride? 
 AL-GHAZI No, they didn't. There were two officers in the car. Both were executed. 
 I understand that. Those men were your men-- 
 -- they were. They were Police. 
 I'm sorry. 
 FLEURY (CONT'D) Where was this car when they hit it? 
 Good news is that if he shoots you, he's gonna shoot you sitting on an American tank... with an American- made bullet. So, it's kind of "all in the family." 
 8/18/06   75. 
 How about we get into those American Suburbans... with their American A/C... 
 The car was parked here? 
 AL-GHAZI Yes. 
 Backed in? 
 AL-GHAZI Yes. 
 They were attacked from the front. Must have assumed the killers were fellow officers... Have any of these men been identified? 
 The same Mosque is enough to identify them, link them to a cell? 
 Suweidi? 
 8/18/06   76. 
 Suweidi is a known militant stonghold. Al-Qaeda could recruit from storefronts. 
 Can we go to check out some of these surrounding buildings? 
 Seems reasonable that the Planner had to observe and based on Hamza's past history, it's consistent that he would want to video the attack. Is that true? Is that accurate? 
 Well, in order to video, in order to observe, you need a view. 
 That building sees all three crime scenes. 
 -c'mon now. This is insane: we got enough security to invade Suweidi, let alone that building- 
 (to Al-Ghazi, respectful) Could you ask? (MORE) 
 8/18/06   77. 
 FLEURY (CONT'D) We're already seeing the crime- scenes individually -- why not all at once? 
 -time. I understand. 
 FLEURY (CONT'D) You have to ask the General, then the General would ask the Prince. Does it go higher or is that... is the Prince the end of the chain? 
 FLEURY (CONT'D) We'll be at the Community Center. (beat) Janet, wanna play hoops? 
 This is the kind of radical circumstance that could have seriously upped Shaq's free throw percentages. Take a man. Ship him off to Riyadh. No phones, constant threat of death, no girls, no hip hop. Nothing... just free throws. Shaq, he'd be shooting at least seventy percent. Lakers would still be together. Kobe and Shaq lovers forever. 
 Hey, Boss... check this out. 
 8/18/06     78. 
 LEAVITT (CONT'D) Just posted half hour ago. 
 LEAVITT (CONT'D) So self congratulatory. Makes me sick. 
 This is unacceptable. 
 8/18/06   79. 
 Tell me it didn't burst-tell me it didn't burst- 
 8/18/06   80. 
. 
 8/18/06   81. 
 You've seen the images of the attack posted on the internet? 
 AL-GHAZI Yes. 
 Look for yourself. 
 AL-GHAZI He was here... 
 Formed the plan up here: saw everything he could hit. (beat) Way too pretty a' plan to have been fully hatched on just one visit. He came here a couple times. 
 I see. 
 8/18/06   82. 
 (refocusing) Two big answers in two small minutes. Imagine if we had a couple days together. 
 A... 
 And I imagine that will run until sundown? 
 8/18/06   83. 
 You want to tell her that? 
 Big wall. 
 How many Princes are there? 
 They all get palaces this big? 
 8/18/06   84. 
 Who pays for all this? 
 General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet... 
 Hey, man - I drive a Hybrid. 
 (to Grant: genuine worry) What's a Raptor? 
 Super. 
 8/18/06   85. 
 I do. 
 I've seen that the man who planned the worst crime in your Kingdom's history is without a doubt Saudi... 
 8/18/06   86. 
 That was impressive. 
 Think it will work? 
 Yeah. Maybe. I mean, you can only play the "I'm going to the press card" like three more times. So, maybe. 
 They're paranoid and overly self- protective. 
 They aren't protecting anyone. There's no conspiracy. They're just terrified. Finally. The Saudis have finally seen the Monsters they helped create, because those Monsters have come home. And if Saudis don't catch Saudi Monsters, that's the end. 
 8/18/06   87. 
 That's dead on accurate. Very impressive. That's why they're making it hard on us, and that's why he wants to help `em turn the screws. 
 They can have every shred of credit- 
 -you see the slums on the way in? 
 Yeah. 
 See that even though their homes are falling down, they had satellite dishes bolted on? 
 Yeah... 
 Everyone already knows you're here. Credit? If the Saudis cracked this Cell while these servants were pouring coffee, Al-Jazeera still leads the story with your Team. 
 Have you been to the crime-scene? 
 No- 
 -if you had, you'd see the evil work of real Talent. The kind that doesn't stop until it's forced. 
 And the path to Hell is paved with good intentions. 
 You having fun? 
 (genuine smile) Beats hell outta visa-stamping. (smile vanishing) (MORE) 
 8/18/06   88. 
 By catching Abu Hamza. 
 Then here's to you. Let's bet: when this Colonel Al-Ghazi comes out, he's in-charge of the investigation -if so, you set me up on a date with Janet Mayes. 
 (to   Leavitt) Do me a   favor and tell Janet that she and   Damon Schmidt got a date when he   gets back to the States. 
 8/18/06   89. 
 We should start with the dead shooters. 
 Can we photograph all three of them? Couple hundred copies each... 
 Good. If it's OK with you, I'd like to suggest we split up as follows... 
 8/18/06   89A. 
 (from the crater) Fellas, what we want to do is get this water out of here... see what's really going on. Understand? 
 8/18/06   90. 
 (to the Saudis) Got to get a little dirty, people. Crawl up in it. Make deep contact. You get that? 
 Have him pass these out to the compound security. See if anybody knows them. 
 Would you mind doing one more thing for me? 
 8/18/06   91. 
 No, Sir. 
 Could you tell me if you recognize any of these men? 
 ...Horrible. 
 I don't know any of them. 
 I'm just wondering. That chair out side. Looks like it gets a lot of wear. Looks comfortable. 
 That my mom's chair. 
 See, that's exactly what I was thinking. I'm guessing she spends a lot of time sitting outside? 
 All day. 
 She must pretty much see it all. Right? 
 She does. 
 Where is she? 
 She's sleeping. 
 8/18/06   92. 
 Let's wake her up. 
 I've seen him. 
 Where? 
 Like, a week ago. Twice I've seen him. Watering...With the garden crews. I remember he was wearing a Liza Minnelli T-shirt. I thought that was funny. 
 What about the others? 
 (closer examination) No. Just him. I remember the T- shirt. I remember thinking it was odd...? 
 What, the Liza Minelli shirt? 
 No. I do think Liza Minelli's gone odd, but that wasn't it. 
 What was odd? 
 He was a Saudi. The gardener. 
 Yeah. 
 Saudis, like Americans, don't do manual labor. Blowing leaves is beneath them. 
 8/18/06   93. 
 (to Maddy) Thank you. 
 Who is he? 
 That's one of the many things we're trying to find out... 
 AL-GHAZI Find out if he worked with the gardeners. 
 8/18/06   94. 
 (beat) How are your Sons? 
 -what do you know about what my kids need? What they saw? What the rest of their lives might be like? 
 (beat) I thought maybe your Boys...without their Mom anymore...might ask you why sometime... 
 8/18/06   95. 
 (beat) Tomorrow it'll be somebody else's wife. 
 Then tomorrow I'll come back. 
 We know where he lives? 
 You don't seem very excited. 
 Where? 
 8/18/06   96. 
 It's a gurney. 
 SYKES (CONT'D) Who's missing an ambulance? 
 SYKES (CONT'D) Could somebody please go get Sergeant Haytham? 
 8/18/06   97. 
 SYKES (CONT'D) (loud) Sergeant Haytham! 
 Here. 
 You cannot touch any Muslims. 
 No problem. Can I still touch Americans? 
 Of course. 
 8/18/06   98. 
 What's gas running a gallon out here, Al-Ghazi? Penny gallon? 
 A trillion reasons for our Leaders to hold hands another one hundred years. 
 Agreed. 
 8/18/06   99. 
 Yes, I do. 
. 
 8/18/06   100. 
 (half joking to Al-Ghazi) Feel like I'm back home in Detroit. 
 FLEURY'S POV: 
 8/18/06   101. 
 (beat) OK. Shouldn't we arrest him or shoot him or something? 
 This place is community service? 
 Why did he turn himself in? 
 8/18/06   102. 
 (through Al-Ghazi) How does he know he slept soundly? 
 (through Al-Ghazi) Is that why you quit? 
 8/18/06   103. 
 How do they get them? 
 Could Hamza get this equipment? 
 (through Al-Ghazi) How do we find him? 
 (to Al-Ghazi) Well, I think I get the `prayer' and `luck' parts... 
 8/18/06   104. 
 Whatever this is, it blasted-off like NASA. 
 Driven in at an angle... go deeper... 
 `High-order explosion' doesn't do it justice: what's left a' this looks like it was put through a wood-chipper. 
 (to Sykes) Hospital Identification... Ambulance identification. 
 8/18/06   105. 
 Do you know this hospital? 
 Yes. 
 Call it in. 
 OK. 
 (focused; to Al-Ghazi) What you got? 
 Why? 
 8/18/06   106. 
 Where's Muaath? 
 We never get to do anything fun. 
 Sykes, I'm guessing you don't even remember how to load your gun. 
 That's not funny. 
 She's not trying to be funny. 
 I'm a very good shot. 
 I'm sure. 
 (O.S.) Yes. 
 (O.S.) Snipers have seen nothing. No telephone line into the house. 
 8/18/06   107. 
 (O.S.) ONE DOWN! RPG! 
 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) CLEAR. 
 Prints are on the other side... 
 8/18/06   108. 
 
... 
 (distracted) Yeah... I pulled so much it's hard to remember it all. 
 Bolts? 
 Yes. 
 Wing nuts? 
 Yeah. 
 Razor blades? 
 Sure. 
 8/18/06   109. 
 (calling back) 
... 
 C-4... 
 (beat) The Coalition... 
 -the Prince's Convoy just showed. 
 This is bullshit. You know it. Meaningless. There's no leader here. These are kids. That's it. 
 8/18/06   110. 
 We're out of here. 
 Yes, that's it. Smile for the cameras, body-bag some children. Wrap it up, but us -- out. I get it. 
 INNER-CIRCLE Take the Americans inside now and keep them out of sight. You will be spoken to about their presence here. 
 You need water? 
 8/18/06   111. 
 You really ought not look at this. 
 (pointing at the dead) That fella got shot right through his God damn nipple... 
 Don't stare too long. It'll start living in your dreams. 
 No -- I know. 
 You do? (beat) How did you know we were here? 
 The Prince has Men at Al-Rahmah. 
 Ask him. (beat) 3 vehicles will stay behind when the Prince and Press leave. You'll convoy straight to BA flights into Dulles -- last minute fares come out of your budget, by-the-by. Tried to swing upgrades, but check at the counter. 
 8/18/06   112. 
 -Ellis Leach? 
 You know him? He's gonna be put out to pasture: made an example of by the President to ensure all levels of government get tough on Terror. (right at Fleury) You won the hand on the River card. 
 We didn't win shit, Schmidt. These are teenagers... children with pictures that someone far senior has provided them. 
 -kidding me? You mean those are Terrorist targets? Holy Wow. Momma, don't let your children grow up to be cowboys. (beat) Just get ready to go home and revel in the fact that for the next few weeks your shit won't stink. 
 Hello? (beat) Yes, Sir. We're all here and healthy. I'm sitting next to their corpses but this may not be over. These don't feel like anything resembling senior leadership- (beat) -thank you Sir. I do. (MORE) 
 8/18/06   113. 
 (to Al-Gahzi) What do you think? 
 AL-GHAZI Amateurs. It's a small win. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm thinking about going straight to Dan's, gonna order six PBRs- 
 -Pabst? 
 Keep it real. You ever drink PBR, Haytham? 
 No. 
 Any beer? 
 8/18/06   114. 
 (small smile) No. 
 Now...that's just unreasonable. Good Police work and problem drinking are like a chicken and egg thing: which enables the other? 
 (to Al-Ghazi) Remember how we caught that cell? 
 AL-GHAZI Yes. Car bomb. He went back to pick up his deposit on the rental car. 
 Four hundred dollars. For four hundred dollars, he was caught. Stupidity. Catching the cell was easy. Just like this. The cell came back. 
 8/18/06    115. 
 I'm serious. Beer will open up your subconscious. Canned beer especially. Give you instincts they can't teach- 
 (looking back) Is he responding to the call? Dropped back... 
 8/18/06   116. 
 You whole? 
 Think so- 
 8/18/06   117. 
 WHAT THE- 
 (panicked) ADAM! WHAT -- WHAT ARE THEY DOING? 
 
! 
 
 -DOOR HELP- 
 8/18/06   118. 
 Hands up -- you're gonna fall- 
 They're going to disappear... 
 (back to his crew) GET DOWN! 
 8/18/06   119. 
 8/18/06   120. 
 Nobody's gonna hurt Leavitt but me. 
. 
 8/18/06   121. 
 (Arabic) He's been shot! BE READY. 
 
 NOW. HURRY. 
 AL-GHAZI We should not be here... 
 BRAKES-REVERSE-TO THE RIGHT... 
 8/18/06   122. 
 -GET OUT OF- 
 8/18/06   123. 
 (O.C.) I CAN SEE THE MERCEDES... BLOOD- TRAILS RIGHT UP TO AN APARTMENT IN THE NEXT BUILDING- 
 MOB FORMING NEXT BLOCK! 
 8/18/06   124. 
 READY? 
 (O.C.) (in Arabic) GOD DAMN HIM! 
 
! 
 8/18/06   125. 
 THIRTY EIGHT RAZOR MAD DOG!!! 
 I do not like these people. 
 We go in the front door. Haytham - cover the stairs. Janet - hallway. Watch the side doors. Watch your backs. 
 8/18/06   125A. 
 8/18/06   126. 
 (beat, to Al-Ghazi) Is Allah on the other side of that door? 
 AL-GHAZI (beat) I think were about to find out, my friend. 
 
?! 
 8/18/06   127. 
 (to Leavitt) Sykes is going to kick your ass. 
 Everybody OK? 
 There's at least three more of them. 
 It's okay Little One. 
 8/18/06   128. 
 8/18/06   129. 
 You are a traitor to your country... a traitor to your God. 
 8/18/06   130. 
 ...Don't... 
 8/18/06   131. 
: 
 (in Arabic) Thank you. 
 Thank you, Lieutenant Haytham. 
 May peace be with you. 
 May peace be with all of us,   my friend. 
 8/18/06   132. 
 8/18/06   133. 
 We're going to testify next Tuesday. Fleury's going first. I'm gonna go through it with each of you one on one in advance - make sure we're all on the same page. If they ask if we've talked about this, the answer is unequivocally "No." OK? (beat) You did outstanding work over there. I'm proud of you. You hold your heads high. 
 Yeah. 
 Janet... my dreams are... (beat, intent) What did he whisper to you? 
: 
 8/18/06   133A. 
 Will you tell me what Grandfather whispered to you before they took him? 
 8/18/06   134. 
 Do you remember? 
: 
 "Don't worry: we'll kill them all." 
 8/18/06   135. 
 8/18/06   136. 
 You stop the people that hurt Uncle Fran? 
 Yeah, there are... (a beat) But you want to know something? 
 What?

 Mrs. Floyd Frank Ross's daughter. My poor child. My poor child. 
 Mrs. Floyd Oh yes we do. My poor child. Are you gawna be stayin with us or are you hurrying home to your mother? 
 Mrs. Floyd Well god bless him for that. The tariff here is seventy-five cents for room and supper. That does not include your daytime eats. 
 Mrs. Floyd Your father owed for two days, god bless him. 
 Mrs. Floyd You'll share a room with Grandma Turner. We've had to double up, what with all the people in town come to see the hanging Judge Parker's put on for us. 
 Mrs. Floyd Was it a good'n? 
 Mrs. Floyd This was in the poor man's room. This is everything, there are no light fingers in this house. If you need something for to tote the gun around I will give you an empty flour sack for a nickel. 
 Mr. Goudy 
 Objection. Hearsay. 
 Mr. Barlow Dying declaration, your honor. 
 Mr. Barlow And then? 
 Mr. Barlow What did you do then? 
 Mr. Goudy 
 Objection. Speculative. 
 Mr. Barlow You found a flat gray rock at the corner of the smokehouse with a hollowed-out space under it? 
 Mr. Goudy If the prosecutor is going to give evidence I suggest that he be sworn. 
 Mr. Barlow Marshal Cogburn, what did you find, if anything, at the corner of the smokehouse? 
 Mr. Barlow And what did-- 
 Mr. Barlow What did you do then? 18 Cogburn Well we rode up to the Whartons', near where the North Fork strikes the Canadian, branch of the Canadian. 
 Mr. Barlow And what did you find? 
 Mr. Barlow What did you do? 
 Mr. Barlow What did you do then? 
 Mr. Barlow Did you find the jar with the hundred and twenty dollars in it? 
 Mr. Goudy Leading. 
 Mr. Barlow What happened then? 
 Mr. Barlow And what happened to Marshal Potter? 
 Mr. Goudy Objection. 
 Mr. Barlow And what became of Odus Wharton? 
 Mr. Barlow Okay. You may ask, Mr. Goudy. 
 Mr. Goudy Thank you, Mr. Barlow. In your four years as U.S. marshal, Mr. Cogburn, how many men have you shot? 
 Mr. Barlow Objection. 
 Mr. Goudy There is more to this shooting than meets the eye, Judge Parker. I will establish the bias of this witness. 
 Mr. Goudy How many, Mr. Cogburn? 20 Cogburn I never shot nobody I didn't have to. 
 Mr. Goudy That was not the question. How many? 
 Mr. Goudy Let us restrict it to "killed" so that we may have a manageable figure. 
 Mr. Goudy Around twelve or fifteen. So many that you cannot keep a precise count. Remember, you are under oath. I have examined the records and can supply the accurate figure. 
 Mr. Goudy Twenty-three dead men in four years. 
 Mr. Goudy How many members of this one family, the Wharton family, have you killed? 
 Mr. Barlow Your honor, perhaps counsel should be advised that the marshal is not the defendant in this action. 21 
 Mr. Barlow The history is relevant your honor. Goes to Cogburn's methods and animosities. 
 Mr. Barlow Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother, and Clete Wharton, half-brother? 
 Mr. Goudy You were armed and he advanced upon you with nothing but a king bolt? From a wagon tongue? 
 Mr. Goudy And, returning to the encounter with Aaron and his two remaining sons, you sprang from cover with your revolver in hand? 
 Mr. Goudy Loaded and cocked? 
 Mr. Goudy And like his son, Aaron Wharton advanced against an armed man? 
 Mr. Goudy Yes. I believe you testified that you backed away from 
? 
 Mr. Goudy Which direction were you going? 
 Mr. Goudy Very amusing I suppose--for all of us except Aaron Wharton. Now, he advanced upon you much in the manner of Clete Wharton menacing you with that king bolt or rolled- up newspaper or whatever it was. 
 Mr. Goudy And you were backing away? How many steps before the shooting started? 
 Mr. Goudy Aaron Wharton keeping pace, advancing, away from the fire seven eight steps--what would that be, fifteen, twenty feet? 
 Mr. Goudy Will you explain to the jury, Mr. Cogburn, why Mr. Wharton was found immediately by the wash pot with one arm in the fire, his sleeve and hand smoldering? 
 Mr. Goudy Did you move the body after you shot him? 
 Mr. Goudy You did not drag his body over to the fire? Fling his arm in? 
 Mr. Goudy Two witnesses who arrived on the scene will testify to the location of the body. You do not remember moving the body? So it was a bushwack, as he tended his campfire? 
 Mr. Barlow Objection. 
 Mr. Goudy Why would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn? 
? 
 Bluff, Arkansas? 28 LeBoeuf He is a crafty one. 
 pursuing? 
 Hey. 
 County, Missouri. 
 foreshortened. 
 My name is Forster. I practice dentistry in the Nation. Also, veterinary arts. And medicine, on those humans that will sit still for it. 61 Rooster (indicating corpse) You have your work cut out for you there. 
 Traded for him with an Indian, who said he came by him honestly. I gave up two dental mirrors and a bottle of expectorant. (beat) Do either of you need medical attention? 
 I have my bearskin. You might want to head to the Original Greaser Bob's. He notched a dugout into a hollow along the Carrillon River. If you ride the river you won't fail to see it. Greaser Bob--Original Greaser Bob--is hunting north of the picket wire and would not begrudge its use. 
 I have taken his teeth. I will entertain an offer for the rest of him. 
 A Methodist and a son-of-a-bitch! 
 I don't know any Emmett Quincy. 
? 
 (to) I don't like you. I hope you go to jail. My lawyer will not help you. 
! 
 sly! 
 
 (to) Take them horses you got and move! 
 
 (to) Get on up that hill! Don't you stop. 
 Tell me another lie and I will stove your head in! 
 Cogburn! Do you hear me? 
 Rooster's Voice The girl is nothing to me! She is a runaway from Arkansas! 
 That is very well! Do you advise me to kill her? 
 Rooster's Voice Do what you think is best, Ned! She is nothing to me but a lost child! 
 I have already thought it over! You get mounted double fast! If I see you riding over that bald ridge to the northwest I will spare the girl. You have five minutes! 
 I will not give you more time. 
 Too thin, Rooster! Too thin! Your five minutes is running! No more talk! 
 Rooster's Voice I am leaving but you must give me time! 
 Up that hill! 
 Quiet there! 94 The idiot makes a pig-squealing sound in acknowledgment and then falls quiet, loping alongside Mattie and. 
 I will do what I have to do. 
 Help yourself. Have some of the coffee. 
 We do not have buttermilk. And we do not have bread. We are poorly supplied. What are you doing here? 
 Let that go! Farrell, see to his wound. What happened? What are you doing here? 95 
 They will do it. It will embarrass you every time. Most girls like to play pretties, but you like guns do you? 
 I will give him a little more time. 
 Til I think he has had enough. 
 Hold fast a while there, Doctor! 
 He is not a medical doctor. Was that Rooster waylaid us night before last? 
 Yourself, eh? You and Cogburn, quite the posse. 
 Your friend is gone. You are alone. 
 You are too nervous, Doctor. It will be hours before he is back with help. 
 I need a good judge. What about Coke Hayes--the old fellow shot off his horse? 
 Poor Coke. He rode back for me. Coke Hayes had spine, and could keep his wits in a tight spot. Dead now, but he should have been dead ten times afore now. Your friend Rooster does not collect many prisoners. 98 Mattie He is not my friend. He has abandoned me to a congress of louts. 
 You do not varnish your opinions. 
 There will be time for that at The Old Place. 
 I have other plans for you. 
 No, it will be too chancy with two men up if it comes to a 99 race. You will wait here with the girl. When we reach Ma's house I will send Carroll back with a fresh mount. You will be out by dark and we will wait for you at The Old Place. 
 No. We are short a horse. It can't be helped. 
 Hours, if they come here at all. They will guess we are all gone. 
 That is the way I will have it. 
 He will do no such thing. Tom, you know the crossing at Cypress Forks, near the log meetinghouse? When you are mounted you will take the girl there and leave her. Do you understand that, Tom? If any harm comes to this child you do not get paid. 
 Baaaaa! Baaaaa! 
 Well, Rooster, will you give us the road? 
 Moo! Moo! 
 Just Chaney. Our agreement is in force: she was in excellent health when last I saw her. 
 What is your intention, Rooster? Do you think one on four is a dogfall? 
 I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man! 
 Well Rooster, I am shot to pieces. It seems neither of us is to see Judge Parker. 
 Rooster's Voice Are you there? 
 Rooster's Voice Can you clamber out? 
! He will amaze you with his skill and dash! 
 July 18, 1908 
 Yes'm, I am Cole Younger. This is Mr. James. It grieves me to tell you that you have missed Rooster. He passed away, what, three days ago, when the show was in Jonesboro Arkansas. Buried him there in the confederate cemetery. Reuben had a complaint what he referred to as "night hoss" 117 and I believe the warm weather was too much for him. We had some lively times. What was the nature of your acquaintance?

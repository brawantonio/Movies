 FADE IN: 
 Ink's wet, the presses are rolling, the papers are stacking -- rise and shine, make a dime, no news without the Newsies -- etc. Jack jumps out of his bunk and shakes the BOY below. 
 Wake up, Crutchy -- The World is waitin'. 
 (yawning) Tell Mr. Pulitzer my yacht was lost at sea. Jack laughs and tosses him his crutch. The dorm is now alive with waking boys -- yawning, stretching, pulling on pants, hitching up suspenders as they sing -- SONG: "CARRYIN' THE BANNER" (Approx. 7 minutes, 15 seconds) 
 THAT'S MY CIGAR... 
 YOU'LL STEAL ANUDDER. The boys begin to wake,                          KID BLINK yawning, stretching,                HEY BUMMERS, WE GOT WORK TO DO complaining as they hit the floor: pants pulled                         SPECS on, suspenders hitched             SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME up, boots laced tight.               MY MUDDER? 
 AH, STOP YOUR BAWLIN' ALL WHO AST YOU! MUSH, cross-eyed and skinny with big ears and lisp, play- fully pushes the NEWSIE so he falls on his hammock. 
 Hey, whattaya? 
 How'd you sleep, Jack? 
 On me back, Mush. 
 (thinks that's hilarious) You hear that, you hear what he said? I ast how'd he sleep -- 
 Jack, this look like I'm fakin' it? He hobbles towards Jack on one crutch. 
 Who says you're fakin' it? 
 The streets are fulla fakes these days -- it's hurtin' the rep of genuine articles like myself. I gotta find me a new sellin' spot, where they ain't used to seein' me. Jack smiles; Mush taps Crutchy on the arm... sings.

 Too rotten to be the sewer.   It must be -- 
 -- the Delancey brothers! 
 Inna back, ya ugly little shrimp! Oscar and Morris glare at the crowd, daring anyone to do anything about it. Jack calmly walks Snipe back to his place in line, then faces the Delanceys who try to stare him down. The air is electric. Nearby -- 
 Five to one, I say Cowboy skunks 'em -- who's bettin', who's bettin' -- The Newsies shake their heads.    Nearby the staring contest continues until -- 
 You shouldn't be callin' people ugly little shrimps. Oscar. Unless you're referrin; to the family resemblance in your brother here. The brothers glower, look at each other, then back at Jack, who grins at them. 
 That's right. It's an insult. And so's this -- Jack deftly reaches out both hands and flips the derbys off both their heads. The brothers scramble for them and the chase is on.

Seeing Les staring at him, Jack winks. Les smiles back, fascinated. Jack turns back to Weasel with a fifty-cent piece. 
 The usual. Weasel grabs for the coin -- Jack flips it out of his            * grasp and onto the counter. The Newsies whoop. 
 Hundred for the wiseguy -- next!                       * 
 scans the newspaper for a catchy headline; Race, Crutchy, the others wander up, doing the same. A commotion O.S. and they look up to see -- -- at the window, Weasel is in David's face.                     * 
 Ya got ya papes -- move outta here.                    * 
 I paid for twenty -- you only gave                     * me nineteen! (CONTINUED) 
 (loving it) You callin' me a liar, kid...? David's sweating, aware that all eyes are on him.                      * 
 I want that other paper. The Delanceys start for David when suddenly Jack steps                 * up, slams his hand on David's papers, closes his eyes                  * and does a flip-count. The expert.                                     * 
 Nineteen, Weasel. An honest mistake -- on account of Oscar                            * can't count to twenty with his                            * shoes on.                                                 * Weasel glowers -- but wants to get back to business.         He backhands Morris who looks surprised. 
 Next! 
 Hold it.   Race -- spot me two-bits. Race flips him a coin.     Jack slaps it on the counter. 
 Another fifty for my friend here. 
 I don't want another fifty -- ! 
 (moving away) Sure you do. Every newsie wants more papes. 
 These papers are yours, I don't                           * take charity from nobody! I don't                         * even know who you are -- 
 Cowboy!   They call him Cowboy! 
 That and a lotta other things -- including Jack Kelly, which is what my mudder called me. What do they call you, kid? 
 (thrilled) Les. This is David, he's my brother. He's older. 
 (barely glances at David) No kiddin'. How old are you, Les? 
 Near ten. 
 No good. Anybody asks, you're seven. (as Les is appalled) Younger sells more papes, Les -- and if we're gonna be partners -- 
 Hold it! Who said anything about partners -- ? 
 You owe me two bits, right? Okay, so I consider it an investment. We sell together, split 70-30, plus you get the benefit of observin' me -- no charge. 
 (to David) You're gettin' the chance of a lifetime here -- you learn from Jack, you learn from the best. 
 If he's the best, then why does he need us? (CONTINUED) 
 I don't need you, pal. But I ain't                     * got a cute little brother to front                     * for me. And Les here...                                * (smiles down at Les who smiles back up angelically) ... With this kid's puss and my God-given talent, we can easy move a thousand papers a week. Whattaya say? Deal? 
 Gotta split fifty-fifty. 
 Sixty-forty.   Or I forget the whole t'ing. David reluctantly offers his hand. Jack spits in his palm and shakes. Les whoops and they move off, Jack already being the mentor -- 
 The name of the game is volume, Dave. You only took twenty papes -- why? 
 Bad headline...? 
 First t'ing you gotta learn -- headlines don't sell papes, newsies sell papes. We're what holds this town together -- without newsies, nobody knows nuttin'! They move away from Newsie Square as above them, the GOLDEN DOME OF THE WORLD BUILDING glistens in the morning sun. 
 (O.S.) (reading sarcastically) 'Trolley Strike Drags On for Third Week' -- this so-called headline drags on for infinity! (CONTINUED) 
 The news is slow, Chief, the Trolley Strike's all we got -- 
 (O.S.) It's all Mr. William Randolph Hearst has, too -- see how he covers the strike! The magnifying glass swings to a copy of the New York Journal with a large black headline: "NUDE CORPSE ON RAILS -- NOT CONNECTED TO TROLLEY STRIKE." The CAMERA COMES AROUND to reveal JOSEPH, himself, a thundering presence in smoked-glasses and a beard, wielding the magnifying glass like a gavel of judgment. 
 Hearst is killing us in the circulation war -- and you give me headlines that would put a whirling dervish to sleep! 
 (nervous editor) We'll get a new headline writer, Mr. Pulitzer. 
 Steal Hearst's man -- offer him double what Hearst pays. 
 That's how he stole him from us. (sighs) Chief, you spend as much as you make fighting Hearst. That's why the paper's losing money -- 
 I created the World to be the best and I'll spend whatever it takes to -- (stops) What is that deafening noise? 
 Just the Newsies, Chief, I'll -- 
 Never mind -- where was I?                             * 
 Creating the World, Chief.                             * 
 This paper's losing money because there's too much fat, inefficiency -- not because I'm fighting to                         * make us number one! Well, we're going to cut costs, maximize profits -- and still beat the socks off Hearst -- (beat) I want to know how by tonight. 
 Some newsies got corners, see -- same spot, same customers. Me,                         * I like to keep moving, enjoy the life of the big city. I spot an opportunity, I sell a pape. That's the advantage of being an independent businessman, instead                       * of workin' for wages.                                  * 
 Paper, mister? Without breaking the kiss, the man kicks out at David who jumps away. Shaking his head, Jack whispers something to Les, who rushes over to the Lovers, still kissing. 
 (earsplitting shout) Extry -- 'Runaway Carriage Crushes Cop!' 
 WOMAN (LOVER) (cooing) Oh, honey... look at that sweet little lamb... David, watching with Jack, can't believe this.       Les comes running back waving a coin -- 
 He gimme a dime! He said I should go far away and keep the change! 
 You're a natural, kid. You remind me of me -- and I can't say greater than that. 
 (the rookie) Extra, 'Trolley strike drags on!' 
 (the master) Nextry, nextry -- 'Ellis Island in flames -- big con-fla-gration!' 
 What -- ?   Where's that story -- ? 
 (making sales) Page nine -- thank you, sir. Nextry, 'Thousands flee in panic -- ' 
 (on page nine) 'Trash fire near immigration building frightens seagulls -- ?' 
 'Terrified flight from flaming inferno!' Thank you, much obliged -- (CONTINUED)

 Buy me last pape, mista...? 
 Our father taught us not to lie. 
 Mine taught me not to starve. So we both got an education. 
 You just make things up -- like those headlines. 
 I don't do nothin' the guys who write this stuff don't do. It ain't lyin' -- it's just improvin' the truth a little. Les comes running back, wiping his mouth, with a quarter. 
 The guy gave me a quarter! Quick, gimme some more last papers! 
 (grabs him) Hold it -- I smell beer! 
 The guy bet me I wouldn't drink some -- that's how I made the quarter! 
 Hey, no drinkin' on the job -- it's bad for business. What if somebody called a cop or somethin'? 
 There he is, officer -- do your duty! Jack spins, sees the man -- 
 Beat it -- the bulls! He races off. David, confused, races after him, Les looks very worried as he runs with David -- 
 Just for one little sip of beer -- ? 
 You, Sullivan! Stop, I say!     You hear me, Sullivan? 
 Who's Sullivan -- ? 
 Mistaken identity -- all micks look alike to these birds! 
 (still worried) One sip! I didn't even swallow it! Jack leads them into the doorway of -- 
 You young miscreant! Wait'll I get you back to the Refuge! 
 The Refuge -- ? (CONTINUED) 
 Sleeper! 
 I'm not crossing that! Anyway, I don't think they're chasing us -- 
 No?   What're they doin' then? 
 I think they're chasing you! Snyder and MacSwain huff out onto the roof. David, still uncertain, looks back at them -- the runs across the plank. Jack calmly topples the plank to the street as the pursuers reach it, gasping for breath -- he gives Snyder a little salute, then moves on to a rooftop exit -- 
 )R(   5/8/91 - (2)                                        25. 
 I want some answers -- Why was he chasing you? What's the Refuge? 
 The Refuge is this jail for kids. That guy, Snyder, he's the warden. 
 You were in jail...?   Why? 
 I was starvin'. I stole some food. 
 (suspicious) Right, food. He called you 'Sullivan' -- 
 (bridling) Yeah, food. My name's Kelly, Jack Kelly, like I told you. Think I'm lyin'? 
 You have a way of 'improving the truth.' Why was he chasing you? 
 Because I escaped. 
 (awestruck) Oh, boy. How? 
 This big shot gimme a ride out in his carriage. 
 (sarcastic) Bet it was the mayor, right? 
 Nah. Teddy Roosevelt.    Ever heard of him? David starts to reply when he sees something behind Jack             * that makes his mouth drop open. At the top of a short                * flight of stairs, a vision is frowning down at them,                 * speaking in a theatrical Swedish accent.                             * (CONTINUED)

 (accent) What is the meaning of this? No one is allowed backstage -- you will leave at once! Out, out, out, out -- 
 You wouldn't kick me out without a kiss goodbye, wouldya, Medda? Surprised, she gasps in delight -- throwing her arms around Jack. David can't believe it. Medda's accent quickly disappears. 
 Kelly, where've you been, kid? I miss you up in the balcony -- you know I sing all my songs to you. 
 This is David and Les. And this is the greatest star of the vaudeville stage today, Miss Medda Larkson, the Swedish Meadowlark. 
 (accent) Welcome! 
 Medda also owns the joint. 
 (no accent; to David) Don't ever own a theater, kid. Don't even think about it. 
 (awed) I won't. I promise.

 This kid is good. Speaking as one professional to another, I'd say you got a future. 
 Okay if we hang here awhile, Medda? 'Til a little problem outside goes away? 
 As long as you like -- now the lark must warble. Hey, you -- (flags down a passing candy butcher) -- give my guests whatever they want.

 (singing) 'MY LOVEY-DOVEY BABY'... etc. 
 It's late, my folks'll be worried ... What about yours? 
 They're out west lookin' for a place for us to live -- (takes something from his pocket) -- like this. It's the cover of a dime novel with a blue-perfect sky over a perfect yellow desert; a large red sun shines down on a perfect adobe. 
 That's Sante Fe -- out in New Mexico? Soon's Pop finds us the right ranch, they're sendin' for me. 
 (sleepily) Then you'll be a real cowboy... 
 Why don't we divvy up at my place...? You can meet my folks... 
 Scabs!   Soak the scabs!   Etc. 
 Jack -- let's get outta here -- ! The boys move away, Jack looking back at the beating. 
 Maybe tomorrow we get a decent headline. 
 (seeing Les) My God...! What happened? 
 He's just sleeping, Momma -- 
 We've been waiting dinner -- where've you been? David says nothing; crosses to the table and dumps the day's receipts on it, looks up at his father proudly. 
 You made all this selling papers...? (CONTINUED) 
 Half of it's Jack's -- he's our selling partner. And our friend. This is my parents. Jack nods awkwardly, starts to say something when SARAH, 16, enters from another room with an armload of lace piecework. She's beautiful -- Jack becomes instantly tongue-tied. 
 That's Sarah.    My sister. She smiles -- Jack still can't find his tongue.       Mayer, seeing his awkwardness, steps in -- 
 Esther -- maybe David's partner would like to stay for dinner. Add some more water to the soup. 
 (mortified) Mayer...! Mayer laughs, joined by Sarah and David -- and finally Esther herself as she waters the soup. Jack stands drinking in the family's warmth. 
 What I saw today, I gotta say your boys are born Newsies, Mr. Jacobs. With my experience and their hard work -- just a little more, thanks -- (third bowl of soup) -- I figure we can peddle a thousand a week and not break a sweat. 
 That many...? 
 More when the headline's good. 
 What makes a headline good? 
 Catchy words -- like, uh, 'corpse' or 'maniac,' or, let's see, 'love nest' or 'nude' -- Sarah and David giggle; Esther looks shocked. 
 (embarrassed) 'Scuse the language there, uh, maybe I'm talkin' too much... 
 (laughing) You talk fine, Jack -- Sarah, get that cake your mother's been hiding in the cabinet! 
 That's for your birthday tomorrow! 
 I've had enough birthdays!    This is a celebration! David leaps up to fetch silver; Sarah gets a luscious chocolate cake from a cabinet -- 
 It's only the beginning -- the longer I work, the more I'll make -- 
 You work only until I go back to the factory! Then you go back to school, like you promised. 
 It will heal... they'll give me back my job... I'll make them... Jack sees how worried the family is.       No one seems able to speak, then --

 The factory. An accident. (bitterly) He's no good to them anymore so they just fired him. He's got no union to protect him. 
 David?   Time to come in now. Jack looks in at the warm family tableau: the lullaby, Sarah reading to Mayer. David, going in, sees his friend's expression. 
 Why don't you stay here tonight...? 
 I got my own place... but thanks.                      * Your family's real nice, Dave.                         * (beat)                                          * Like mine.                                             * David nods, climbs in the window.                                 *

 Actual income, as well as projected income, against actual operating costs, as well as projected operating costs, produce a reduced marginality of profit which in turn -- 
 Seitz!   What in blazes is he talking about? 
 Says you need to make more money, Chief. (CONTINUED) 
 Of course I need to make more money! But how do I make more money, you bloodless blot? 
 (unflappable) I have several proposals. The first is to increase the paper's price -- 
 Then Hearst undersells me and I'm in the poorhouse. Brilliant. 
 Not the customer price -- the price to the distribution apparatus. Exasperated, Pulitzer looks to Seitz for a translation. 
 You mean the Newsies...? Charge the Newsies more for their papers? Bad idea, Chief. 
 Very well. My next proposal -- salary cuts, particularly those at the very top -- 
 Wait. What  do the Newsies pay now -- fifty cents per hundred papers? If  you raised it to sixty cents -- 
 A mere tenth of a cent per paper -- 
 -- then that, multiplied by forty thousand papers a day, seven days a week -- well, it would pay some of the bills around here. 
 Chief, if you do this, every Newsie we got will head straight for Hearst.

 Not necessarily. As newspapermen, Hearst and I would cut each other's throats to get the best of the other. But as businessmen -- and gentlemen -- we often agree on ways to keep down certain operating costs. If I know Willie Hearst, he's going to wish he thought of this himself. 
 What about the other papers -- ? 
 If we do it, they'll all do it. It's only a tenth of a cent -- nobody gets hurt! It's good for the Newsies -- an incentive, make 'em work harder, sell more papers! Now get me Hearst on that contraption. Seitz sighs and reaches for the phone.

 Keep me informed -- I want to know everything that happens. 
 Are we really an important story...? 
 What's important? A year ago I covered the war in Cuba -- charging up San Juan Hill with Colonel Teddy Roosevelt. A very important story. Now it doesn't seem so important -- except Teddy's our governor and probably on his way to the White House. Is the Newsies' strike important? It all depends on you.

 If it ain't Jack be nimble, Jack be quick. 
 You're movin' up in the world, Spot -- got a ocean view and everything. Spot and Jack exchange "heh-hehs."   David's getting more nervous. 
 So I'm hearin' things from little birdies in Harlem and Queens and all over. They're chirpin' in my ear: 'Jackie-boy's Newsies are playin' like they're goin' on strike -- ' 
 (blurting) We're not playing -- we are on strike -- it's -- 
 What's this, Jackie boy?   Some kind of walkin' mouth? (CONTINUED) 
 (unintimidated) It's a mouth with a brain -- and if you got half-a-one you'll listen. Tell 'im, Davey. 
 Uh... we started the strike but... we can't do it alone, so... we've been talkin' to Newsies all over the city... 
 So they told me. And what did they tell you? David looks nervously at the circling henchmen. 
 That... they're all waiting to see what Spot Conlon does. That you're the key... (as Spot puffs himself up; David sees an opening) That Spot Conlon is the most respected and... famous... newsie in New York... and probably everywhere else... 
 And... if Spot Conlon joins the strike, they'll join and we'll be unstoppable so you gotta join and ... well... you gotta... He trails off.    Spot nods, turns to Jack. 
 You're right. Brains. (hardens) But I got brains, too -- and more than half-a-one. How do I know you punks won't run the first time some goon comes atcha with a club? How do I know you're in it to win?

 Not good enough, Jackie-boy.   You gotta show me. 
 Maybe you lost your guts, Spotty- boy -- (as Spot freezes) -- or maybe you traded 'em to some chicken for that beak of yours.

Spot's eyes are locked on Jack's for an excruciating moment -- then Spot grins.

 How can I be sure the Delanceys stink -- 'cause that's how things work.

 Did you really escape in Teddy Roosevelt's coach? 
 Not in it.   On it. 
 What was he doing at the Refuge? 
 Runnin' for governor. Showin' his concern, like all pols during elections. 
 Teddy's not like other politicians. He's the biggest hero in the country. 
 Anyway, he's there. I see his fancy coach waitin' for 'im, so I sneaks on top of it. Teddy gets in and he's wavin' goodbye, and all the guys are wavin' goodbye, and Snyder's wavin' -- 'Good-byeeee, Colonel Roosevelt!'

 He only seen what Snyder wanted him to -- good food, everything the city pays for that Snyder usually steals.

 Last year he was a hero.   This year he's a politician.

 Him?   Nah. 
 (smarmy smile) You have a famous friend, this 'Jack.'... Do you know where he lives...? 
 I never seen the guy, honest. (hits his head with his palm) This brain of mine, always makin' mistakes. Got a mind of its own. He hobbles out quickly.    Snyder looks at him, eyes narrowing.

 You're afraid of them, too... 
 Medda's gotta look out for herself same as anybody. We'll find another place. 
 How can they make a whole city afraid? We're the ones putting our necks on the line -- all we need is for somebody to have the guts to stand up and show them we're not alone!

 Can I help you? The figure turns -- Snyder smiles his smarmy smile. 
 Do you have a 'Jack Kelly' registered here? I wish to see him. 
 'Jack Kelly...?' Any of you boys know a 'Jack Kelly'? 
 Unusual name for these parts.                  SKITTERY I knew a Jack somebody once. Prob'ly not the same guy. 
 You mean Jack Kelly -- ? Behind Snyder, they see Jack bouncing in the front door. Racetrack tries to signal him -- 
 -- He was here but he put an egg in his shoe and beat it. Jack sees Snyder -- but instead of running back out the door, he can't resist mocking him behind his back. The Newsies snicker; Kloppman is dying. 
 I have reason to believe he's an escaped prisoner. Possibly dangerous.

 David says you're moving away when the strike's over. To Santa Fe. I've never been out of the city.

 We do not.

 What'd I tell ya -- interestin', right? Sarah giggles.       The leaflet gyrates in the wind as we GO TO -- 
 (sweating) Of course the city is very concerned that this, uh, event doesn't get out of hand, but... Chief? 
 We can't just charge in and break it up, Mr. Pulitzer -- we got no legal cause. Pulitzer looks as if he knows something they don't.

 Would the fact that this rally is organized by an escaped criminal be cause enough, Mayor? 
 An escaped criminal...? 
 A fugitive from one of your prisons, Mayor -- a convicted thief who's been at large for some time under the alias of 'Jack Kelly.' His real name is...? 
 Sullivan, Your Honor -- Francis Sullivan. I would have caught him before now but -- 
 You know Warden Snyder, don't you, Mayor? I believe you appointed him. The Mayor nods ruefully; not one of his best appoint- ments. 
 If this boy is a fugitive, then the chief can quietly arrest him and -- 
 Not quietly -- I want an example made. I want this rabble he's roused to see what happens to those who dare to -- well, they should see justice in action. 
 Arrest him at the rally?   But... 
 By the way, Mayor, I'm having a few friends for cards that night -- newspaper friends, Willie Hearst, Gordon Bennett. Perhaps you'll join us -- we can talk about the coming election. (CONTINUED) 
 (too eager) I'd be honored... thank you. Pulitzer dismisses them and they start out, Snyder oozing backwards, the Mayor now all business with Chief Devery. 
 Chief, when you arrest this Kelly, you'd better go in force -- in case some of his misguided friends should start any trouble. As they go, Pulitzer picks up his magnifying glass and examines the leaflet. We CUT AWAY as he stares through the glass so he seems to be looking at -- 
 Extry, extry -- Newsies take Noo Yawk! Swarms of excited Newsies engulf Boots as     he pretends to hawk the imaginary headline. They cascade      toward the entrance where Jack and David shake hands,     slap backs as they flow past. Kloppman goes past, then      Denton. Sarah and Les are nearby. 
 Hey, Denton -- sit down front! You're the guest of honor! 
 (shakes his head) I'm working press tonight. (looks around) The only working press. As usual. 
 As long as you keep writing about us, they're gonna know we exist. 
 You know the boys, Mayor -- Mr. Bennett of The Tribune, Mr. Taylor of The Times, of course you know Mr. Hearst -- and this is a new member of our little group, Mr. Gammon, who just came back from Europe... 
                                * Mr. Gammon owns The New York Sun.                     * They all light cigars as Pulitzer begins to deal. 
 Carryin' the banner! 
 (a roar) Carryin' the banner! The noise threatens to blow the roof off the theater as we see -- 
 We come a long way but we ain't there yet -- and maybe it's only gonna get tougher from now on! That means we get tougher too -- (as a huge roar goes up) -- it also means we get smarter! That's why we're gonna listen to my pal David and stop soakin' the scabs -- SEVERAL IN CROWD No!    They asked for it -- etc.

 That's right -- start fightin' each other! Prove what the big shots say is true -- we're street rats with no brains and no respect for nothin' -- includin' ourselves! (as they quieten) Here's how it is: we don't stick together, we're nothin'. We don't trust each other, we're nothin'. We don't act together, we're nothin' -- and we might as well go back to the streets where we belong. What's it gonna be? (looks at Spot) Whattaya say, Spot? 
 I say -- 
 I say... what you say... I say! Spits in his palm and they shake.

 Aren't you Warden Snyder? Snyder nearly swallows the whistle -- 
 I'm Denton of The Sun. I've heard about your work with young people. I wonder if you'd agree to an interview? Snyder blinks at him, glances at his watch, then lowers his police whistle, smiling modestly. 
 David tries to move to Jack to warn him but Race and the others have formed a chorus line and drag him into it. David shouts over the song -- 
 Jack -- you've gotta get out of here! Snyder! (as Jack cups his ear) Snyder! 
 (interviewing) Is it Snyder as in 'snide'? Furious, Snyder blows the police whistle for all he's worth. Instantly police burst in from every door -- all converging on Jack. Immediately he leaps off the stage into the arms of several boys below -- then fights his way out the front door --

 If you're tired of beating up children, maybe you'd like to try a lady next. Confused and intimidated, the Irish cop looks at her -- then ducks his head shamefacedly and moves away. 
 Run, David, hurry -- 
 They got Jack -- 
 You can't help him if you're in jail, too! You were right, David -- you've got to keep fighting them -- always. (kisses him) Now go. Please. David looks at her, very moved, then goes. She turns back to her theater -- the sounds of the melee sweep over her. She watches, tears welling in her eyes... 
 Awrise, awrise, court is now in session, Judge E.A. Monahan presiding. 
 Any of you represented by counsel? No? Good. That'll move things along considerably. David sees Denton come in, a neat bandage on his head. 
 Judge Movealong, ya honor, I object. 
 On what grounds? 
 (proudly) On the grounds of Brooklyn, ya honor! The Newsies congratulate Spot.    Monahan gavels.

 Talk and eat, right? On you, huh, pal? They laugh and clap his shoulders as he looks uncomfort- able. Suddenly David gasps, seeing Jack led out in shackles, his face bruised and swollen. Everybody stares, horrified. 
 Hiya, fellas! Hey, Denton -- guess we made all the papes this time, huh? How'd my picture look? 
 None of the papers covered the rally. Not even The Sun. Jack is stunned, David bewildered, as Denton turns abruptly and leaves the courtroom. The Bailiff shoves Jack in front of the bench. Snyder slips in from a side door.

 Denton, what's happened -- you get fired or somethin'? 
 Reassigned -- back to my old job as The Sun's ace war correspondent. The owner thinks I should be covering only the 'really important' stories. So wish me luck, boys. At least half what I wish you. (to David) They don't always fire you, David. He moves off; David, stunned, hurries after him. 
 They bought you off... didn't they? Didn't they! 
 They could've blackballed me from every paper in the country. I'm a newspaperman, I have to have a paper to write for. He looks at David; hurt, betrayed, angry; wishes there was more he could say. He hands him something from his coat. 
 This is the story I wrote about the rally. I want you to read it at least. He hands it to David and   goes. David returns to the others, angrily crumpling   the story and hurling it onto the table.

He flashes the high-sign to the boys as the carriage moves off into the night. 121    OMITTED                                                       121 &                                                                    & 122                                                                  122 
 Get him inside. 
 Very impressive. So where do they keep the trains in this station? Seitz shows   him into an elegant library. Snyder tries to follow but   Seitz stops him, closing the doors. Inside, Jack looks   around to see the imposing figure of Pulitzer staring at   him, framed by luxurious furnishings. For a moment, the   two just stare at each other. Then --

 Know what I was doing when I was your age? I was in a war. The Civil War. 
 I heard of it. You win? 
 People think wars are about right and wrong. They're not. They're about power. You know what power is? 
 Heard of that, too.   I don't just sell ya papes, Joe.   Sometimes I read 'em. Pulitzer ignores the impudence, continues quietly. 
 Power means that I could see to it that you serve your full sentence at the Refuge. Or I could pull strings and have you free tomorrow. It means I could give you my pocket change -- and you'd have more money than you'd likely ever earn. 
 You bribin' me, Joe? Thanks for the compliment, but I ain't got the power to stop the strike -- 
 I disagree. You're the spirit of the strike, without you, they'd fall apart in a few days. 
 Ring for my coach, willya?   It's past my bedtime --

 -- or what? You'll send me back to the Refuge? I'll bust out again -- 
 -- and be a fugitive who's pursued and caught and returned. I'm offering you a choice -- is that what you choose? 
 I told ya... I can't call off the strike. 
 I'm not asking you to. All I ask is that you return to your old job -- as Newsie for the The World. 
 And be a scab? Forget it -- 
 For a few days. Then the strike ends -- and it will end, boy, make no mistake -- and you can go wherever you want to buy a ticket. Free and clear, with money in your pocket... and no one chasing you. Jack is silent, troubled.    Pulitzer pushes a buzzer. 
 You go back to the Refuge. Think it over in your cell. Let me know in the morning. 
 Jack! (CONTINUED)

 (to the driver) After him! The driver whips the horse forward but is jerked off his seat as the carriage separates. The horse runs off. Amidst the confusion, David and Jack tear through the gates way ahead of Snyder. 
 (stepping up to Snyder) Don't worry. He's got no place to go. 
 Why're you stoppin' -- we've got to run! 
 You shouldn't'a done this, David. They could put you in jail -- 
 It's worth it -- let's go -- 
 You go to jail, what happens to your family? You don't know nothin' about jail! Thanks for what you done, but you gotta get outta here --

 Look... I'm seein' t'ings... tell me I'm seeing t'ings -- ! David and the others look in disbelief -- walking with the scabs is Jack, wearing a tight new suit, flanked by Weasel and other goons. As Jack moves past, staring straight ahead, the chant dies...

 Hey, Jack -- it's me, Mush, lookit me -- look, willya?

 Keep after them -- we don't need him! (starts the chant) Stop The World -- don't scab! Etc. Some chant halfheartedly, confused, demoralized. A few toss down their picket signs in disgust. David moves among them, desperately trying to keep the chant going. The scabs move on, passing Les, who gives Jack a stricken look as he moves away.

 (holds up the package distastefully) What is this? 
 Hey -- I'm saving that! 
 (to David) Don't be too hard on your friend. Maybe he had his reasons for doing what he did.

 You try any tricks, and I go straight to Mr. Pulitzer. (grins) Will you be requirin' anything else? Then I bid you good night. 
 Sleep well, cowboy...? Jack ignores him, moves off with his papers. The Delanceys pass by; Morris grinning at him, bouncing a club in his hand. 
 Come wit' us, cowboy -- we're gonna fix your pal Davey today -- fix 'im so's he can't walk no more.

 (impatiently) All right, all right -- just say the traitor's name. It's Hearst, isn't it? Say it! Say the name of the scoundrel whose press you used so I can make him the disgrace of the newspaper world! Say his name, damn you! 
 We just wanna say, 'Thanks, Joe.' (as he stares, stunned) And Hearst and them other owners? Maybe they don't have to know. Depends. 
 Perhaps we can resolve our... small differences. David digs out their demands and prepares to read.

 We gotta warn Jack -- ! 
 Jack -- !   Jack -- ! 
 I don't know how he got in here, Mr. Seitz -- but I'll take care of him, with pleasure. Just say the word! 
 With pleasure. You're fired. 
 Come again...? A tomato hits him in the face; he turns to see Les wiping tomato juice off his hands. 
 He said, you're fired. Triumphant, Jack hoists Les over his shoulders: 
 The strike's over -- we beat 'em! (CONTINUED)

 (remembers) The bulls! Jack -- the bulls! Jack sees several police shoving through the crowd toward him. He quickly deposits Les -- turns to run and sees -- -- Snyder right in front of him, hands behind his back. Jack spins away and right into the arms of -- 
 We brought the Warden over to say goodbye. Goodbye, Warden. 
 (to Snyder) Remember what I told ya -- first t'ing ya do in jail, you make friends with the rats, share what you got in common -- (sees Jack) Hiya, Jack! My leg tells me the strike's over! * 
 (confused) Crutchy -- I don't get it.   What happened -- ?

 Ya orta seen it, Jack -- he came chargin' into the Refuge wavin' his walkin' stick like a sword and he's leadin' this army of lawyers and cops and Snyder's hidin' in the patata bin -- 
 What're you talkin' about -- who come chargin' in? 
 Who?   Your pal! Him! 
 parked across the square. A Rough Rider opens the door and a man leans forward -- a glimpse of silk hat and walrus mustache as Teddy Roosevelt raises his walking stick in salute to Jack across the square. 
 Governor Roosevelt's very grateful that this problem was brought to his attention. He'd like to offer you a lift, anywhere you like. This time, you ride inside. 
 Think he could drop me at the train yards?

 You really goin' this time...? 
 It's now or never, Racetrack. 
 Won't be the same without ya. Give ya even odds on that. He shakes; the others crowd around. David looks on, left out for the moment; Sarah and Les beside him. 
 See ya in the funny papes, cowboy -- 
 Yeah, Blink, keep ya eye peeled. 
 (forced) Ya hear what he said -- Blink says... ya hear it? 
 We heard it. (offering marbles) My best shooters. Never know when ya need good shooters. 
 Take it   easy, Jackie- boy. Ya    ever get in a spot -- (spits   in his palm;   shakes) -- think   of me. 
 Don't wanna alarm ya, Jack, but what I hear, out West ain't like New York at all -- it's fulla bulls, for one t'ing -- not cops, neither, but big ugly animals with horns and -- 
 (hugs him) I'll miss ya, Crutch. Crutchy hobbles off to the dock. Jack looks off at the waiting coach, then holds out his hand to Les, who runs up and clings to him. (CONTINUED)

 I ain't no good at writin' and stuff but... I'll be thinkin' of ya... 
 You don't have to run away anymore, Jack. You have a choice now. 
 We won today, but the fight's not over. You're needed, Jack. We need you. Here. He stands, looking at them. 
 Maybe that's what scares me... Suddenly, the emotions are too much for him -- he turns, runs across the square, not looking back, racing towards the coach. Les starts after him -- David catches him, holds him, as he and Sarah watch --

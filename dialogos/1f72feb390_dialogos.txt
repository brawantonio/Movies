 (V.O.) (softly) Traffic flowing smoothly on the 
 (V.O.) Another day of traffic. Traffic everywhere I look. Cars stop and move and stop again. People sit at the wheel thinking their thoughts. 
 (V.O.) Day in, day out. Red light, green light. Traffic on the major arteries and traffic in the little veins. 
 (V.O.) Cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos, Mopeds, bikes and buses. Emergency vehicles screaming and wailing. Birth and death, walk and don't walk. 
 (V.O.) Traffic yesterday, today and tomorrow. Bumper to bumper, soul to soul. This is Lone Eagle over and out. 
 25, 1986 
 Where you're going, mister? 
 
 
 I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding. 
 I opened thousands of brains. 
 Big mess every time. 
 Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch. 
 Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution. 
 What about her? 
 She died. 
 Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course. 
 Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie. 
 They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all. 
 That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed. 
 S teven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan. 
 Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else. 
 What? 
 You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning. 
 It can't be all that personal. 
 I mean Nicky, really, no. 
 I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done. 
 We're able to surprise each other. 
 Because we're completely mismatched. 
 I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight? 
 It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel. 
 It's your best play, Nicky. 
 He will absolutely hate it. 
 You are going where? 
 Very bad today. 
 
 
 I am sitting here five years in traffic. It is one continuous traffic since I arrive. Why must it be? 
 I go to college. I thought you knew. 
 I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about. 
 I'm seeing your play tonight, remember? 
 So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer? 
 Is it? 
 She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee' 
 
 
 Mother is totally, you know, upset. 
 Nicky, you don't come in for a while. Everything's okay? 
 I saw your picture in the paper. Two papers. 
 That's not what I hear. I have four, five actors working here. `His best play since "Yessiree Bob" I'm telling you, they say it. 
 He doesn't want to hear it. 
 Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back. 
 Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused. 
 Oh please. Not now. (beat) She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years. 
 She is kicking you out. 
 Bullshit, Daddy. 
 Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me? 
 I didn't turn her into Mother. You did. 
 Know what Mother said to me? Daddy's demons are so intense he doesn't even know he's lying. 
 Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night. 
 (whispering) A lovely piece of theater. Small but important. 
 Quietly effective. 
 Press a button and they give us money. 
 (whispering) How is Lillian? I haven't seen her. 
 Don't talk like that. 
 That sounds so final. But are we really surprised? 
 But didn't we know it would happen? 
 (whispering) Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts? 
 We must abandon. 
 Ruptured steam pipe. 
 Ruptured steam pipe. 
 Asbestos lining. Do not inhale. 
 Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud. 
 We must abandon. 
 Ruptured steam pipe. 
 Asbestos lining. 
 Do not inhale. 
 
 
 I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute. 
 What do I exude? 
 Tonight you find out what it means to suffer. 
 Shit. They don't have any carrot soup. 
 You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears. 
 It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous. 
 That's what I said eighteen months ago. 
 Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers. 
 Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review. 
 I recite it to myself with masochistic relish. 
 Yessirree Bob! Yessisree Bob! 
 You don't know about obscure writers, Nicky. How we have our anger to nurture and love. Our murderous fantasies for any amount of fame, money , power and sex. 
 Guys ready to order? 
 Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables. 
 Elliot? 
 (to Nicky) This is a great young out-of-work actress. 
 Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice. 
 We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca. 
 Say it again. 
 Alla puttanesca. 
 (to Nicky) Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent. 
 I got a good feeling about tonight 
 We got Ojeda going. He pitched beautiful last time out. 
 Plus Darryl's due for a big game. 
 How come? 
 (quoting Steven Schwimmer) `One thing saves Elliot Litvak's work from complete mediocrity, and this is his lack of ambition.' 
 It gets funnier. 
 (zipping up) It gets funnier. See, Nicky? They chart the laughs. This from a critic who lives like a fallen monk. Whose address is a carefully guarded secret. 
 A critic who has to disguise himself. 
 To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding. 
 Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business. 
 He has to disguise himself, Nicky. 
 For his own safety and peace of mind. 
 Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca? 
 I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me. 
 I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him? 
 I think I remember. 
 Not one of Steven's finer moments. 
 A little. 
 He has -- something. A funny little quality I find -- 
 Engaging. 
 A little drastic maybe? 
 What? 
 Alla puttanesca. 
 Is it safe? 
 I think we Nought to wait. 
 You say we go? 
 I'm not ready. 
 The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist. 
 You've been saying that for years. 
 (mockingly) `I'm just a professional. A dues- playing member of a guild.' Because you're afraid, Nicky. That's the darkest part of you. You don't think you're good enough. 
 
 Where are you going? 
 What about the haircut? 
 I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows. 
 I hear good things about the new play. 
 Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously. 
 He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue. 
 The fact is, I have to get going. 
 Is what true? 
 Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone. 
 Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play. 4 EXT. THE BARRYMORE THEATER 1                                                       41 47th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. 
 I can't take this anymore. He forgets simple lines. He forgets where to stand. We tell him and tell him and tell him. I know he's a sweet man. I love Peter. It's not his fault. But I've never worked in a show where the leading man has 4              parasites in his brain. 
 Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted. 
 I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said. 
 So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews? 
 Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts. 
 Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater. 
 (deliciously) You're dangling from the last letter of your last name. 
 Sidney. 
 I was educated by nuns. 
 I have excellent long-term memory. 
 I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth. 
 But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines. 
 What color? 
 Burnt sienna. 
 This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it. 
 I kissed her while she was laughing. 
 I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love. 
 I hear he got the parasite in Burma. 
 I heard Borneo. 
 Why do we blame the Third World for our parasites? Maybe he got it in Denver or Minneapolis. 
 Maybe he got it in Borneo. 
 I feel shaky about one line in particular. If I can get past this line. I think I can handle the last long speech. 
 Which line, Peter? 
 The Son says to the Father, This could be it. 
 That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it. 
 It's the same line. The Father simply repeats what the Son says to him. 
 This could be it. 
 I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it. 
 This could be it. 
 (long pause) This could be it. 
 Let's work on it. 
 (long pause) Let's work on it. 
 Do you think he can do it? 
 He's a very sweet man. 
 Home. 
 No one's waiting. 
 If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what? 
 But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom? 
 Do you want to talk about doing crazy things. 
 Never mind. 
 Our Steven not only disguises himself. 
 He goes to the theater armed. 
 (V.O.) This could Pbe it. 
 (V.O.) This could be it. 
 He feels he has to defend himself if necessary. 
 (V.O.) Steven, it's me. Will you open please. 
 You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day. 
 I haven't come to you. 
 But you're here. So you must have come to me. 5 
 In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair. 
 Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs. 
 Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently. 
 The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims. ( reaching down to clutch a fistful of letters) Look how they hate me for telling the truth. It's an education, Paisley. The College of Raw Nerves. (MORE) 
 Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider. 
 And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me. 
 I don't want you, Steven. 
 I'm going home to my machine. 
 The new Nicky ogan 
 Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going. 
 I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition? 
 Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it. 
 I don't have a date. I don't want a date. 
 I have a class. I'm late. 
 I'm not sure. 
 
 
 A man is hit the other day by another taxi. I mean he is flying. Crash against the windscreen. Right here in my face. Blood is everywhere. 
 I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen. 
 You have to eat at the wheel. You cannot get anywhere. 
 Under the Manhattan Bridge. 
 (into speaker) Who is it? 
 (into speaker) Go way. I'll call a cop. 
 (into speaker) Where the hell are you? 
 What do you want? 
 Nicky comes on Sunday's. 
 If it's you, what are you doing here? 
 Where does Nicky get his hair cut? 
 It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in. 
 Get yourself something to eat. 
 Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle. 
 You know the answer to that. 
 They're only gonna lose. 
 The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees. 
 It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things. 
 But the son is suppose to stop crying. 
 Don't make me sit through one of your plays. 
 Since when did that matter? 
 My back is killing me. 
 I can't find it. 
 I lost it. I lose everything. 
 So I know who I'm letting in. 
 `Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here. 
 I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here. 
 You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon. 
 You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand. 
 So what are you going to do about it? 
 Show him who we are. 
 Then you should carry a gun. 
 Where is it? 
 That was a big mistake. 
 You should never be without a gun. In this city? 
 If he carries a gun, you have to carry a gun. 
 No, we're not. 
 We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack? 
 In this city? And you don't carry a gun? 
 How do we maintain our dignity and self-respect? 
 It's your best play, Nicky. 
 He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow. 
 (quoting) `The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.' (beat) I'm telling you as a friend. 
 There are things that speak to us from the past. 
 In this city you don't walk five feet out the door and there is somebody trying to take what's yours. 
 Your truth is locked in your past. Find it. Know it for what it is. (beat) Shoot him, Nicky. 
 The American theater doesn't need people like that. 
 Keep going west. Last building before the river. 
 Paisley Porter. 
 About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who. 
 She was very evasive. 
 How do you want the sideburns. 
 
 
 I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere. 
 You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island. 
 Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars. (to Nicky) Where's your white Lincoln limo? 
 The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro? 
 Might be an accident on the West Side Highway. 
 Matthew's my grandson. 
 He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before. 
 This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming. 
 That's a simple subject. 
 67                                                               67 Filling the screen. Actual footage. A man in a parachute coming down on an expanse of grass. It is the infield at Shea Stadium. He carries a sign reading "Let's Go, Mets". Security men hustle the parachutist off the field and into the Mets dugout as the game begins. 
 Nicky, God bless. You're well? Your family's well? That's all that counts. 
 Hey. I love this guy. Be good. Stay well. I'm serious: Give my best to everybody. 
 What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you? 
 You see what you're doing, don't you? 
 You're charming the boy. 
 Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury. 
 This could be it. 
 This could be it. 
 This could be it. 
 This could be it. 
 Does it feel comfortable? 
 Does what feel comfortable? 
 This could be it. 
 This could be it. 
 What's it like to shoot somebody? 
 Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once. 
 Dew-eeey! Rog-errr! 
 You're a family man, Frankie? 
 An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do? 
 And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it. 
 It's a simple subject. 
 Yessiree, Bob. 
 Rog-errrr! Dew-eeey! 
 Great game. Red Sox are winning. 
 Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy. 
 It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work. 
 Clemens has a blister. Look. They're pinch-hitting for him. 
 You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody. 
 You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person. 
 If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down. 
 I always thought a night's sleep is what you get for a hard day's work. But these last weeks I lie there helpless. Hour after hour. I've come close to praying for the first time since I was your age. Pray to God to put Sme out. 
 I talked to the doctor again, Pop. He said she's not getting any better. He wants to talk to you. I think he means right away. 
 How bad is she? 
 This could be it. 
 Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it. 
 Then say it. 
 Speak it like it's real. Matthew. 
 Life is good. 
 Hen-duuu! Hen-duuu! 
 What are people? 
 Matthew. 
 People are dependable. 
 People are dependable. 
 People are dependable. 
 But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a -- 
 Hen-duuu! 
 People are dependable. 
 Life is good. 
 Because God loves a winner. 
 Washed away. 
 Because faith is rewarded. 
 Washed away. 
 (O.S.) It's all right, Frankie. Just a little touch of suspense. Life is good. 
 (O.S.) Baseball is life. 
 Don't worry. It's a test. 
 (O.S.) What did it say? 
 You're hurting my head. 
 Mookie, Mookie, Mookie, Mookie! 
 (O.S.) We're still winning. That's what counts. 
 1 The Sox are one pitch away. 
 2 One pitch away. 
 1 Stanley's getting ready. 
 2 This could be it. 
 1 This could be it. 
 This could be it! 
 This could be it! 
 It's all right. It's a tie game. We can still win it next inning. 
 Mookie, Mookie, Mookie, Mookie! 
 This is the time. Trust in people. Believe in life. Faith is hard work. Don't give in. Don't give up. 
 Life is true. 
 Trust your team. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Scintillating. 
 I still don't believe it. 
 Hurry back. Hurry back to what? 
 (zipping up) I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend. 
 What are we talking about? 
 Game six is history,pal. 
 We're not making sense. 
 Did you see Mookie hit the ball? 
 Did you see the winning run score? 
 You missed the boat, Popeye the Sailorman. 
 Hold him till I zip up, Tommy. 
 Why won't you tell me your name? 
 It's only our first date. 
 I'm willing to tell you my name. 
 Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this. 
 You have to tell me what you thought of the play. 
 First you tell me. 
 Brilliantly moving. 
 What else? 
 Packs an emotional wallop. 
 What else? 
 A flat-out hit. 
 Are you majoring in theater criticism. 
 Criminology. 
 If you're wondering about the firearm. 
 Yes. 
 This building is not secure. 
 I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself. 
 We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty. 
 What do we want? 
 Mystery. Deception. 
 Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy. 
 What's sexy? 
 Knowing who a person is. Down deep. 
 Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking? 
 You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name? 
 Even if the truth requires a certain adjustment? 
 I don't think he knew, Daddy. 
 Daddy, I'm sorry. But he was so beautiful. I trusted him. When I saw what he really looks like -- 
 
 (OS) Am I really so deeply repugnant? 
 Yes. 
 Except I won't have a father anymore. 
 What will we talk about? 
 Will I believe you when you tell me something? 
 (whispering) Daddy, wait. 
 Then they lost? 
 If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over. 
 They're my team. 
 They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.' 
 The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one. 
 Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore. 
 When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates. 
 Yes. And no more evasive tactics. 
 It's your best play, Nicky. 
 See, Daddy. 
 I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work. 
 What else? 
 An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before. 
 You're out of bullets. 
 See, Daddy. 
 And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense. 
 I called Sports Phone from Lhasa, Tibet. Freezing in my little rented Fiat. Sheep on a hillside. Rocky debris dating back millions and millions of years, from the time the Himalayas thrust up when the plates of India and Asia collided. Red Sox 3, White Sox 2. A moment in the history of the world.

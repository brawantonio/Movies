 
 Kinda lonesome back here. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Little help? 
 Dopinder. 
 (still upside-down) Pool. Deadpool. 
 Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool? 
 It's like Christmas Day, Dopinder. Been waiting one thousand eight hundred twenty- two days, three hours... (checks `Adventure Time' watch) ...and thirty-six minutes for this shit. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Nice. 
 Smells good, no? 
 Not the Daffodil Daydream.      The girl. 
 Ah yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She was supposed to make me a very agreeable wife. Mom and Dad chose her rather excellently. But Gita's heart has been stolen by my cousin Bandhu. Bandhu is as dishonorable as he is attractive. 
 Dopinder, I'm starting to think I'm in this cab for a reason. 
 Because you hailed it? 
 No, my slender brown friend... to give you one crucial piece of advice: Love... is a beautiful thing. When it finds you, the whole world smells like Daffodil Daydream. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) So hold onto love tight. Go at Bandhu hard. Get Gita back. Or else... the whole world will taste like Mama June after hot yoga. 
 And how does Ms. Mama June taste? 
 Like two hobos making love under a drizzle of Limburger- I could go all day like this. Point is, bad. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Shiiiit. My extra mags! I usually leave them right by the door so I'll trip over them! Someone must've moved them... 
 Shall we turn back? 
 No time. Not today. (slides in last bullets) Ten, eleven, twelve... or bust. (chambers a shell into each gun, looks up) Right here! 
 My card.    That's $27.50. 
 Oooo. I never carry a wallet when I'm working. Ruins the lines of my suit. How 'bout a crisp high five? 
 Be sure to... ask for me again? 
 I owe you one. Merry Christmas, Dopinder. 
 And a convivial... Tuesday in April to you, Pool... Guy. 
 You're someone else's problem now. 
 Yes.   I.   Am. 
 Can I get some fries with that shake- shake boobie? If looks could kill you would be an uzi. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Oh, hello, Deadpool here. You may be wondering whose balls I had to fondle to get my own movie. Rhymes with `Polverine.' Couple'a smooth criminals. 
 (ALT:) In a word, gorgeous. 
 (ALT:) Surprisingly little hair down there. 
 (ALT:) It's a jungle down there. 
 (ALT:) Thick underbrush. (beat) Anyway, I smell Oscar. The suit's gonna match the carpet. Now... places to be... faces to fix... bad guys to kill... 
. 
 (bangs crate) They won't disappoint. 
 They'd better not.    And next month's shipment? 
 There won't be one. Demand is high. You aren't the only one with a war to win. 
 (steps forward) That won't do. 
 There's been a small... disruption in our supply chain. We'll deliver in full the following month. Say, ten percent off for the inconvenience? 
 AJAX (CONT'D) We appreciate your business. 
 (sotto voce) Fucking mutant. 
 On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop... 
 ¡Hola! ¡Me llamo Piscina De La Muerte! (subtitled, in YELLOW:) Hello! My name is the Pool of Death. There's no easy way to say this. I'm pregnant, Trevor. 
 (ALT:) Any of you seen Green Lantern? Me neither. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Rich... Corinthian... Leather. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Scuse, por favor! 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Ow.   Ow.   Ow. Ow. Ow. 
: 
. 
. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Loved your work in Daredevil. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Shit.   Did I leave the stove on? 
. 
 (O.S.) Breaking news. A multicar collision turns shots fired on the crosstown expressway... 
 The assailant appears to be wearing a... 
 I've given Deadpool every chance to join us. And what is my reward? More immaturity and criminality! When will he finally grow up and see benefits of becoming X-Man? 
 Like... The house that blows up every few years? The fashion-forward jump-suits? I need to get myself kicked out of X- School. 
 But I thought you were at top of class. 
 Was that sarcasm?    Awesome. 
 You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast is most important meal of day. (hands NTW a protein bar) Here. Protein bar, good for bones. Deadpool may try to break yours. 
 Wait, wait... 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Wait! You're probably wondering. Why the red suit? It's so bad guys can't see me bleed. This guy has the idea. He wore the brown pants. (to camera) All together now... 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Twelve..! 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Eleven... 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Ten... 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Nine.    Shit! Eight. Fuck! Seven.       Shit- fuck! 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Six. 
. Fuck.   You. 
 Someone's not counting.    Cinco. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Me gusta cinco. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Four.   Three. Stupid. Worth it. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (chuckles) Number two... 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) What the shit-biscuit! Where you at, Francis? 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) One. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I'm touching myself tonight. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Really?     Rolling up the sleeves? 
 (V.O.) I know what you're thinking... 
 (V.O.) I'll bet he works out. So what if I am pulling the double shift at the ab- factory? What if I do want my man menu to feature the shredded beef? Call it insecurity. But I haven't touched a carb since... 
 Will it help if I slow down?         I didn't. Order. The pizza. 
 This 7348 Red Ledge Drive? (off nod) And you're... Mr. Merchant? 
 The Mr. Merchant who didn't.         Order. The. Fucking. Pie. 
 Then who placed the call? 
 (O.S.) I did. 
 WADE (CONT'D) Pineapple and olive? 
 WADE (CONT'D) Sweet and salty. 
 The fuck are you? And what are you doing in my crib?! 
 (to Jeremy) Burnt crust? 
 God I hope not. (opens the box, winces) Words cannot express- 
 Relax, son, that's hows I likes it!      Once you go black, you never go back! (takes pizza) 
 (stammering) This is about the poker game, right? I told Howie... Listen, take whatever you want! 
 Thanks! 
 (to Wade) Uh. Sir? Before you do anything to him. Could I have a big tip? 
 (already munching) Jeremy, is it? 
 Yeah. 
 Wade Wilson. (quick fist bump) Jeremy, that's a no go on the tiperoo. I'm not here for him. (levels gun at Jeremy) I'm here for you. 
 Dodged a big time bullet on that o- 
 (re: studded jeans) Not out of the woods yet. You need to seriously ease up on the bedazzling. They're jeans, not a chandelier. (sniffs) And the Axe body spray. 
 (sheepish) That's unfortunately me. 
 PS, I'm keeping your wallet.         Ya did kinda give it to me... 
 Can I at least have my Sam's Club card baaa- 
 I will shoot your fucking cat. 
 I don't have a cat! 
 Then whose kitty-litter did I just shit in? (turns to Jeremy) Anyhoo, you by chance know a Meghan Orlovsky? Getting that right? Orlovsky? Orloskvy? Do you? 
 WADE (CONT'D) Good.   `Cause she knows you. 
 WADE (CONT'D) What situation isn't improved by pizza? 
 WADE (CONT'D) (through chews) Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who take a dime to beat a fella down. (cuts another pizza slice) Little Meghan's not made of money, but lucky her, I've got a soft spot. 
 B-but I'm- 
 (returns to Jeremy) A stalker. Threats hurt, Jer. Though not nearly as bad as serrated steel. 
 WADE (CONT'D) So keep away from Meghan.       We cool? 
 Y-yeah. 
 Then we're done. 
 W-we are? 
 Soft spot, remember? But even look in her general direction again? You'll learn in the worst of ways. (pats Jeremy's cheek) I've got some hard spots too. (pauses) That came out wrong. Or did it? 
 SALT & PEPA I love you in your big jeans. 
 (join chorus) You give me nice dreams.     You make me wanna scream... 
. 
 (O.S.) "Oooo, oooo, oooo!" 
 WADE (CONT'D) You've seen the last of Jeremy. 
 WADE (CONT'D) That's why we do it. 
 #2 Hey, think you could fuck up my step-dad? 
 #3 How `bout Vice Principal Renwiki? 
 (suddenly serious) What'd he do to you? 
 #3 Suspended me for smoking. 
 (turns to go) Good for him! Sorry, ladies. Me no dig cigs. And I may look mean. But if I give a guy a pavement facial? He earned it. 
 Hey.   Thanks. You're my hero. 
 That I ain't. 
 Boothe! 
 (turns, smiles) Heya, Wade! 
 Wade Wilson, Patron Saint of the Pitiful. What can I get you? 
 I'd love a blow-job. 
 We got that in common. 
 The drink, moose-knuckle.     But first... 
 WADE (CONT'D) I ain't taking allowance money. Make sure it gets back to Ms. Osflorsky? Onroflensky? Olly-Olly-Oxen-Free? 
 Orlofsky. For a merc, you sure are warm- blooded. Bet you let the boy off easy- peasy, too. 
 (embarrassed) He's not a bad kid, Weas. Just a little light stalking. I was way worse at his age- traveling to far-off places - Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville - (shudders) - meeting new and exciting people - 
 And killing them. I've seen your Instagram. What was Special Forces doing in Jacksonville, anyway? 
 Classified. (whispers) They have a wonderful TGIFridays. Those guys know their way around a Loaded Potato Skin. The point is, I'm trying to put those days in my rear-view. 
 Kahlua, Bailey's, whip cream.        Fellatio in a glass. 
. 
 So he's staring at my Glock in his mouth, like... (mouth full) `I thought you guys had a code!' And I'm like, `Yeah, no kids. No women. Almost fooled by your tits. But the moustache?! 
 Kelly, you mind taking this over to Buck? Tell him it's from Boothe. (whispers, to Weasel) Little foreplay. 
 Remind me what good comes of this? 
 I don't take the shits.       I just disturb them. 
 (trailer voice) It's a dirty job... but someone's gotta take out the garbage. 
 Still kicking. 
 Lemme guess. Ya got Boothe in Sister Margaret's dead pool. 
 Um.    See.    About that- 
 You did not bet on me to die. (looks up at board, incredulous) You bet on me to die. 
 WADE (CONT'D) Weasel, you're the world's worst friend. Joke's on you. I'm living to 102. Like those old Quaker biddies on the Today Show. And retiring on my winnings. 
 Wait, who did you pick? 
 `BIEBER, J.' 
 The Biebs. But I'm probably wrong. Nothing bad ever happens to teen stars who make 80 mil a year and think they're immune to the pitfalls of addiction and consequence. He'll be fine. (raises shot, yells) Drinks on me, soldiers of fortune! 
 Hooah! 
 Whoa, whoa... 
 VANESSA (CONT'D) Sure you wanna shoot your whole wad? 
 Tight. 
 Vanessa. 
 What's a nice place like you doing in a girl like this? 
 (O.S.) It ain't what she's doing, it's who. 
 BUCK (CONT'D) I'd hit that shit. 
 Buck, you'd best apologize, before- 
 WADE (CONT'D) Yeah, that. 
 (to Buck) Say the magic words, Fat Gandalf. 
 I'm sorry! I have no filter between my brain and mouth. I'm working on it. 
 OK, he apologized... hakuna his tatas... 
 (let's go) And you- (shakes Wade off) Hands off the merchandise. 
 Merchandise? So, what, you, uh, bump fuzzies for money? 
 Yup. 
 Rough childhood? 
 Rougher than yours.     Daddy left before I was born. 
 Daddy left before I was conceived. 
 Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin? 
 I didn't know there was any other place to put one out. 
 I was molested. 
 Me too.     Uncle. 
 Uncles.     They took turns. 
 I watched my own birthday party from the keyhole of a locked closet, which was also my- 
 Bedroom?    Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher box. 
 So you had a dishwasher. I didn't know sleep. It was pretty much 24-7 of ball gags, brownie mix, and fun-house mirrors. 
 Who would do such a thing? 
 Hopefully you. Later tonight. (beat) And my Uncle Kevin. 
 WADE (CONT'D) What can I get for two-hundred-seventy three bucks... and a Yogurtland rewards card? 
 About forty-eight minutes of whatever you want... (peers at card) And a low-fat dessert. 
 Time to put balls... in holes. 
 WADE (CONT'D) You said whatever I want. 
 I get it. You love skeeball.          Apparently more than you love vagina. 
 Tough call. Just trying to get to know the real you... not the plunging- necklined, short-shorted, two-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood. 
 Nice tits! 
 Thank you, son. (tousles boy's hair) You know how to make a woman feel special. 
 VANESSA (CONT'D) Balls in holes. 
 Prepare to lose tragically. 
 Bring it, big man. 
 VANESSA (CONT'D) Ruh-roh. 
 The limited edition Voltron: Defender of the Universe ring, por favor. 
 You're roughly three hundred thousand tickets short. (beat) It's nickel-silver-plated. 
 (disappointed) Then I guess the tire-grade rubber Voltron keychain. 
 And the... pencil eraser. 
 (reads keychain package copy, bows) You are now the sworn protector of the gentle people of the planet Arus... (re: eraser, positive spin:) And you... you can... erase stuff... written in pencil. 
 M'lady? 
 Unfortunately, my anus-loving friend, your forty-eight minutes are up. 
 Arus. And you're more evil than evil King Zarkon himself. 
 WADE (CONT'D) How many more minutes for this? (hard sell) FYI. Five mini lion-bots come together to make up the super-bot. 
 (faux-excited) Five mini lion-bots?! (matter-of-fact) Three minutes. 
 (gives keychain up) That's all I'll need! 
: 
 What do we do with the remaining two minutes thirty seven seconds? 
 Cuddle? 
 (O.S.) How long can you keep this up? 
 (raises eyebrow) All year? 
 Happy Valentine's Day... 
 Happy Chinese New Year's... 
 (smiles) Year of the Dog. 
 VANESSA (CONT'D) Relax... Happy International Women's Day... 
 Happy Fourth of July! 
 Happy Yom Kippur... 
 (ALT:) Happy Cesar Chavez Day... 
 (ALT:) Happy Lent... 
 (ALT:) Happy Lyme Disease Awareness Day... 
 (ALT:) Happy Wednesday... 
 (muffled) Happy Halloween... 
 Oo... ow... 
 (muffled) Sorry. (takes out Vampire teeth) Happy Halloween... 
 Happy Thanksgiving. 
 (ALT:) Happy Wednesday. 
 (O.S.) If your left leg is Thanksgiving, and your right leg is Christmas... 
 WADE (CONT'D) ...can I visit you between the holidays? 
 Y'know, red's your color. Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes. Christmas gift! Catch! 
 Holy fucking shit. 
 Limited edition. I had to give the kid behind the counter a rub and tug. I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm kidding. It was nearly five full months of Skeeball. 
 (beams) Y'know, I've been doing some thinking... 
 Really. 
 ...about why we're so good together. 
 Why's that? 
 Your crazy    matches my crazy. We're like two jigsaw    pieces... weird curvy edges... but fit us    together, you can see the picture on    top. 
 Hey, I've been meaning to ask you, only `cause you haven't gotten around to asking me- (pregnant pause) Wade, will you- 
 Uhh... jinx? 
 VANESSA (CONT'D) You're not wearing pants. Where exactly were you hiding that? 
 They say one month's salary. 
 WADE (CONT'D) Slow month. I've been waiting for this day like Boss Hogg waits to get to the crazy cheesy crust... 
 You mean-? 
 I do. 
 That's my line. I love you, Wade Wilson. 
 Thought you charged extra for that. 
 I did.    At my old job. 
 So that's a-? 
 Easy.    I can take it back. 
 What if I never let go? 
 Just rode a bitch's back, like Yoda on Luke? 
 (contented sigh) `Star Wars' jokes?! 
 (corrects) `Empire.' 
 It's like I made you in a computer. 
 WADE (CONT'D) (Yoda voice) Cheese, say! 
 WADE (CONT'D) Perfect. 
 WADE (CONT'D) Wee break. 
 WADE (CONT'D) Shake it like a- Uh. You get it. 
 (V.O.) Here's the thing. Life is an endless series of train-wrecks with only brief, commercial-like breaks of happiness. This had been the ultimate commercial break. Which meant it was time to return... 
 (V.O.) ...to our regularly scheduled program. 
 You're clowning.     You're not clowning?        I sense clowns. 
 People react to news of late-stage cancer differently. 
 (to doctor, springs into action) So what do we do? Surely there's something... we can... do. I mean, my uncle, he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and there was this new experimental drug that- 
 (V.O.) See, people do react differently. Vanessa's already working on Plan A. B. All the way to Z. Me? I'm memorizing the details of her face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it. Or the last. 
 (O.S.) Mr. Wilson? 
 (V.O.) Believe it or not, this is only the ninth shittiest thing that's ever happened to me. 
 (O.S.) Mr. Wilson? 
 (V.O.) Stick around. Number 6 is coming right up. 
 Take your time to process this. 
 You know how many people I've killed to find you? 
 Actually, I do. 
 So you're aware I've been waiting a long, long time for this. And now I'm finally gonna... 
 (ALT:) So you're aware of the category 5 fuck- storm that's coming. 
 (ALT:) Then you know what's coming. I'm about to do to you what Sugar Ray did to the mid-nineties. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Dad? 
 (O.S.) This is my most prized possession. 
 Wham? 
 Wham! (cradles album lovingly) `Make it Big' was the album George and Andy earned their exclamation point. 
 WADE (CONT'D) But this. A little piece of me died the day this came out... 
 So I'm s'posed to just... smile and wave you out the door? 
 Think of it as a spring cleaning. Only if spring was death. (pulls out BERNADETTE PETERS 
) If I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters. (opens purse, it's full of nickels) Looks like I do. 
 Bernadette's not going anywhere. (slam-dunks purse back into drawer) `Cause you're not going anywhere. 
 Right! The tumors are only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. All the things you can live without. 
 You know what I mean. You belong here at home. Surrounded by your Voltron... and your Bernadette... and your me. 
 Babe, we've been through this! Cancer's a real shit-show. A Yakov-Smirnoff- opening-for-the-Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa- State-Fair shit-show. And under no circumstances will I take you to that show. I want you to remember me me. 
 Well, I want to remember us us. (that doesn't sound right) We we? 
 I swear, I'll find you in the next life. And boom-box `Careless Whisper' under your window. Wham! 
 Are you gonna keep saying it like that? Look, I get this impulse. I do. (MORE) 
 VANESSA (CONT'D) Before I met you, I used to fantasize about dying alone in the woods, torn apart by wolves. 
 Super fucking bad-ass. 
 But that was then, and this is now. Walk out that door. I dare you. I will ride you out. And I won't let go. Yoda on Luke. 
 VANESSA (CONT'D) (into Wade's ear) If you're willing to fight. There are still options. We'll find them. Together. 
 (smiles) I just realized! I win! My life's officially more fucked-up than yours. 
 No one's boom-boxing shit. 
 VANESSA (CONT'D) What do we we have to lose? 
 Nothing.    Everything. 
 Sorry. Liam Neeson nightmare. I kidnapped his daughter, and he just wasn't having it. 
 WADE (CONT'D) They've made three of those movies. At some point you wonder if he's just a bad parent. 
 Jesus. Someone needs a blow-job and a shower. Though courtesy calls for the latter first. 
 Three shots of Patron Silver, Weez.     And a cure to terminal cancer. 
 (hands over a green concoction) Fresh out of Patron. Wheatgrass? 
 You're starting to sound like Vanessa... 
 WADE (CONT'D) She sent away for all these colorful clinic brochures. I hear Chechnya's nice this time of... never. Then there's China... Central Mexico... Know how they say `Cancer' in Spanish? ¡El Cáncer.' 
 This belongs on the wall. I want to remember you when you looked... alive. 
 WEASEL (CONT'D) Almost forgot... 
 WEASEL (CONT'D) Guy came in asking for you.     Real Grim Reaper type. 
 WEASEL (CONT'D) I don't know? May further the plot? 
 Wade. 
. 
 Forget your scythe? 
 Mr. Wilson. Have a seat. (Wade sits, long pause) I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. 
 Stalker alert. 
 It's my job. Recruitment. And you have quite a reputation. I'm sorry you've had a tough go. But you're a fighter. And not just for Johnny Canuck, impressive as your stint in special forces was. Forty- one confirmed kills? 
 (bitter) One every seven weeks.     Same rate most folks get a hair-cut. 
 WADE (CONT'D) To wash the taste out. It's hard to forget being so... impressive. 
 Now you spend your days sticking up for the little man, slitting small time throats for small time folks. 
 People change. 
 (low, conspiratorial) Speaking of which... Mr. Wilson, I represent an organization that may be able to help. What if I told you we can cure your cancer? And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of? 
 I'd say you sound like an infomercial. And not a good infomercial, like Slap Chop. More Shake-Weighty. (jack-off motion) 
 The world needs extraordinary men. We won't just make you better. We'll make you better than better. A super-hero. 
 I already tried the hero business. Let's just say it left a mark. The only chance you'll see me again is if I hit `fuck- it.' 
 (V.O.) For now, I'll get through this with the one I love. 
 (pulls out Spanish-English electronic translator) De donde eres? 
 Boca Raton. 
 Ah.   The fancy part of Mexico. 
 We've moved in with my son.       To afford the treatment. 
 Cancer?     Sorry - ¿El Cáncer? 
 Stage four. 
 Toughest part of the Tour de France. 
 Very hilly. 
 Logging some frequent flier miles? 
 (bone-weary) Final stop on Desperation World Tour, 2016, which I believe was also the name of the Stones' last concert... 
 `Final' because this is where we find the cure. 
 No cheques de viajero.      No pesos.   Cash. Americano. 
 NURSE (CONT'D) Chupachups cuestan extra! 
 (O.S.) (angry) Hey! 
 WADE (CONT'D) (ice cold) It's on me. 
 Señor... Abe Solomon? 
 (to Wade and Vanessa) Handsome couple. Good luck to you two. 
 Good luck to you, Pops. 
 Buenos días, Señor Abe. 
 DOCTOR (CONT'D) Voy a llegar dentro de tu cuerpo. 
 I'm sorry.     No hablo español, doc. 
 De que se cure! Señor Abe, you are cured. 
 (tearing up) Thank you. I owe you my life. 
 (over his shoulder) ¡Proximo! Next! 
 (O.S.) Already here, hombre. 
 So sorry, you surprise me. How... long... you standing there, Señor? 
 Long enough... 
 Thank you, Agent Smith. 
: 
 Some kind of anger can't be managed. Like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered! That said... when it comes time to licking wounds... there's no place like home, and I share that home with someone you met, the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al. She's like Robin to my Batman. Except she's old. And black. And blind. 
 
 (V.O.) And I think she loves me. Wait... pretty sure Robin loves Batman, too. 
 (O.S.) Mr. Wilson! Nothing warms my heart like a change of someone else's. 
 RECRUITER (CONT'D) You finally hit `fuck-it.' 
 Worse.  Just promise you'll do right by me. So I can do right by someone else. 
 Of course. 
 Oh, and please don't make my super suit green. Or animated. 
 I hope you enjoy your stay. 
 Um.  My first request?    A warmer table. (shivers) And warmer hands. 
 WADE (CONT'D) Easy!   Aren't you a little strong for a lady?   I'm calling wang. 
 You'd like that, huh.    Welcome to our little hospital. 
 It doesn't look like a hospital. It looks like Chlamydia holding still. 
 WADE (CONT'D) Oral fixation? 
 Shut.   The fuck. Up. 
 (O.S.) Patience, Angel. All in good time. 
 Can I expect turndown serv-? 
 You're a talker. 
 AJAX (CONT'D) (disarmingly matter-of-fact) Mr. Wilson, my name is Ajax. I manage the Workshop. My `welcome' speech used to be full of euphemisms like `You may feel some discomfort.' But I've grown blunt. 
 AJAX (CONT'D) The Workshop is not a government program. It's a private institution tasked with turning reclamation projects like yourself into men of extraordinary abilities. I'm about to remake your life. But if you think cancer cures painlessly, you're wrong. If you think super-human powers are acquired painlessly, you're wrong. 
 AJAX (CONT'D) We're injecting you with a serum that activates mutant genes. For it to work, we need to subject you to extreme stress. 
 AJAX (CONT'D) You've heard the whole make-an-omelette, break-some-eggs bit? (Wade blinks) I'm about to hurt you, Wade. The kind of hurt I can't describe and you can't prepare for. It's cruel stuff. And there's no way out for you. No secret you can tell me. No soft spot in me to appeal to. 
 What, you expected Weapon X? 
 One more thing. What's the ad? `I'm not just the president. I'm a client?' I've been through this procedure myself. It made me stronger. It also scorched my nerve endings. So I no longer feel pain. In fact... (smiles) I no longer feel anything. 
 Something in your teeth. 
 WADE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Made you look! Hey, is Ajax your real name? `Cause it sounds suspiciously made up. What's it really? Steve? Mark? Trevor? Kyle? (E.T. voice) Elliot? 
 Joke away. The one thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor. 
 We'll see! 
 (to Angel Dust) All yours. 
 I want to share what I can give.     I want to be... I want to live! 
: 
 (V.O.) The serum I'm injecting you with targets any mutant genes lurking in your DNA. 
: 
 (V.O.) Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum, so we must subject you to extreme stress. 
 (V.O.) If you're lucky, the mutant genes will activate and manifest in spectacular fashion. 
 (V.O.) If not, we'll have no choice but to keep hurting you in new and different ways. Each more painful than the last. 
 Until you finally mutate.      Or die. 
 (O.S.) Puppies. 
 CUNNINGHAM (CONT'D) It helps picturing puppies. 
 Puppies. 
 Or kittens. If you swing that way. 
 (chuckles) I swing both ways. 
 WADE (CONT'D) But me, I've been making a list of things I still plan to do. 
 A bucket list? 
 I prefer fuck-it list: Naked tandem base- jumping with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs... Sparking up a spliff with the Olympic torch... 
 Finishing my Lego Millenium Falcon... 
 Giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven... 
 Making my kids banana pancakes... 
 (O.S.) With the mouse ears? Creative, and delicious. 
 AJAX (CONT'D) It's OK, I encourage distractions. Can't have you giving up on us, can we now, you little worm? 
 (O.S.) Don't take that shit, Cunningham! How tough can he be? Name like Francis. 
 WADE (CONT'D) That's right! He got `Ajax' off a dish- washing liquid! (laughs from nearby tents) Legal name's Francis. F-R-A-N-C-I-oops. 
 WADE (CONT'D) Dry-cleaning tag, Francis.     Snagged it off your lab coat. (beat) (MORE) 
 WADE (CONT'D) FYI. I may be able to get you the super- hero discount. 
 You are so relentlessly annoying. Shut the fuck up, or I'll sew that pretty mouth shut. 
 Uh, I wouldn't do that. Here's the problem with round-the-clock torture. You can't really step it up from there. 
 Is that what you think? 
 Yeah.   Francis.    That's what I think.

 Waterboarding is the most severe stress known to man. This device prolongs that stress. For hours, days, weeks...

 Or if you keep yapping, years... 
 And I thought you were dicks before this. 
 The saddest part? You still think we're making you a super-hero. You. Dishonorable discharge. Beating up pizza guys. Hip deep in hookers. You're nothing. I'd call you an asshole, but I'd have to answer to assholes. Little secret, Wade. The Workshop doesn't make super-heroes. It makes super-slaves. We're gonna fit you for a control collar and auction you to the highest bidder. (finishes meal, gets up) Who knows what they'll force you to do. Put down freedom fighters. Murder innocents. Or maybe just mow a lawn or two. 
 There's a brave face. 
 Seriously. Now you do have something in your teeth. 
 Enjoy the weekend!

 (bright idea) The `Punch-Bowl!'

 Mr. Wilson... these results are remarkable. 
 DOCTOR (CONT'D) Your cancer cells are more aggressive than ever. Dividing and metastasizing at a fantastic rate. 
 (broken, breathless) Yippee. 
 But... the cells have inalterably changed. They're no longer destructive, but productive, selectively targeting and replacing damaged tissue. 
 That was a lot of... what's the word... syllables. Are you saying I'm better? 
 Better than better.    A miracle. 
 (weak smile) My Mom used to call me that. 
 (ALT:) Me and Jesus. (beat, to doctor) Thank you. I owe you my life. 
 There. There. Your journey's been long and difficult. But you've become something extraordinary. Just rest now. Rest. 
 (V.O.) Then, just when I thought I could breathe easy... 
 ...AJAX. 
 Oo. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king. 
 You f-fucking sadistic- 
 No. Not fair. Everything I've done to you has been in your best interest. Even this next bit. You may be cured, but you still need to learn to be a better man. Polite. Respectful. What better way to teach you than to close this lid... and keep torturing you stupid. 
 (V.O.) If you think I'm losing my marbles `cause I can't breathe. You're only half right. 
 (V.O.) See, if Francis was able to see his reflection... 
 (V.O.) You know what they say. You always remember your first time.

 There... all caught up. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (yells to driver) Thanks for the lift! Apologies if I bled in the recyclables. 
... 
 (O.S.) (from outside) Let's get ready to Rooooooomba! 
 (under breath) Ass-hat. 
 Morning, roomie! (sniffs) This place reeks like old lady pants. 
 (still supine) Yes. I'm old. I wear pants. 
 But you're no lady. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) So comfy. 
 Upside of being blind:     I've never seen you in Crocs. 
 You mean my big rubber masturbatin' shoes? 
 Yes I know. Downside of being blind:        I hear everything in this duplex. 
. 
 One-thousand eight-hundred twenty-two ornaments pinned to two-hundred-sixty calendars. All for a `Christmas' that... never... came! 
 Too much naughty, too little nice. 
 Sit on a stick. 
 Bactine? 
 (dripping sarcasm) Yeah. Bactine should do it. How's the Kullen coming? IKEA doesn't assemble itself. 
 You're telling me. I don't mind the Kullen. It's an improvement on the Hurdal. 
 Anything's an improvement on the Hurdal. I'd have taken a Hemnes... or even a Trysil... over the Hurdal. But I didn't get excited `til I saw the Kullen. 
 Screw please. 
 Here? Now? Just kidding.          I know it's been decades for you. 
 You'd be surprised. 
 And totally grossed out! 
 Ta.    Dah. 
 And I quote: `Looking for roommate. Blind to life's imperfections. Must be good with hands.' Or wouldya rather I build IKEA and you pay rent? 
 Why such a douche this morning? 
 Let's recap. That cock-thistle who turned me into this freak... the one I've been waiting five years for... slipped through my arms today. Arm. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Catching him was my only chance to be hot again. Get my super-sexy ex back. And stop the same shit from happening to anyone else. So yeah, things are pretty fucking scrumptious. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Hash-tag Drive-by. 
 (to herself) I'm gonna find this `Craig.'        And I'm gonna kill him. 
 Once I've got the cure, I'm gonna do the same to Francis... 
 Bloody hell. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king. 
 (can barely speak) What have you done to me?! 
 You give me too much credit. This... this is the result of your genes. (MORE) 
 AJAX (CONT'D) The punch bowl merely raised your stress to trigger the mutation. 
 You... sadistic... fuck! 
 Where's the gratitude?! You're cured! Your mutated cells can heal anything. They're attacking the cancer as fast as it can form. Your insides are a war zone. Not to mention your outsides! 
 AJAX (CONT'D) I've seen similar side-effects before.         I could cure them for you. But really, where's the fun in that? 
 AJAX (CONT'D) I'm going to close this lid again.     Maybe you no longer need it. But I do. 
 He's all yours. 
 You smell like shit. 
 (impressed) Whoa. 
 AJAX (CONT'D) Hey, hey, alright. It's alright. I think he earned that one, yeah? You take off. Go on... off you go. 
 AJAX (CONT'D) One question. What's my name? 
 AJAX (CONT'D) Didn't think so. 
 (V.O.) Sorry, Francis. But my lips are sealed. 
 You can't kill me, Wade. I'm the only one who can fix that ugly mug. 
 Then time to make me me again. 
 (O.S.) Wade!   Help! Wade! 
 Fuck! 
 Say it.     `Francis.' 
 (V.O.) I didn't just get the cure to El Cáncer. I got the cure to everything. 
 Alex, don't stare. 
 2 (O.S.) Oh, my, god, that is so fucking gnarly. 
 3 (O.S.) I just lost my appetite. 
 In the whole wide world, there's nothing as ugly... (beat) ...as fear.

 (O.S.) Ow. 
 Don't make me ask twice.     Where's Francis?! 
 "CLICK" 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I said, where's... fucking... FR- (realizes) You made me ask twice. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Fuck.   Me. 
 Seltzer water and lemon for blood. (off Deadpool's impressed look, shrugs) Or wear red.

 Don't make me ask twice.      Where's- 
 Donde esta Francisco? 
 I don't speak Spanish. 
 (sighs) And I don't have time for you to learn. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Take me to your leader. (turns) I've always wanted to say that. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Squeal.     Like a pig. Where's Francis? 
 In no particular order. Where's your boss? And where can I find good Indian food? 
 Why the red suit? 
 That's so bad guys can't- never mind, they've already heard that. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) You're about to tell me everything you know about Francis Freeman. Known aliases. Current whereabouts. Boxers or briefs. Go. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (forces guy's mouth open, goes in with knife) Open your mouth. Here comes the airplane! 
 (gun pointed at forehead, a la Joseph Takagi) I don't know, I'm telling you. You're just going to have to kill me. 
 OK. (shoots goon in head, a la Hans Gruber, then, to audience:) Right?! 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (goon at knifepoint) Don't make me break out the Collective Soul CDs. 
 You give me your boss.     I give you the rest of your life. 
 (throws woman onto table) I don't feel good about myself.     But where is he? I'm so sorry. 
 BOOM.    STAB.

 Don't recognize the voice? Maybe the resumé: Forty-one confirmed kills. Make that Eighty-nine. Seven the past week alone. Same rate most folks... (pulls out SWORD) ...get a shave.

 No... no way! I'm not making her life as ugly as mine! 
 C'mon, you can't look that bad! It's like that blemish no one notices but you. 
 Wrong. I'm a monster, inside and out. I belong in a circus, the kind that rolls around Eastern Europe in covered wagons. 
 I can't envision a scenario where Vanessa won't take you ba- (Wade steps into light, takes off his hoodie) -aaaaaccckkk!! Holy shit. You... are... terrifying. You look like an avocado had sex with an older avocado.

 WEASEL (CONT'D) We might have to move our relationship to text and phone only. 
 And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug, the asshole who ran that mutant factory, escaped to who knows where. 
 I take back the Vanessa thing.      You have only one option. 
 Find Francis-Go-Fuck-Himself. 
 (not listening) Star in low budget horror movies. Seriously, you look like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah. 
 (equally not listening) I'm gonna work my way through his crew... crushing bad guys' skulls, `til one of `em leads me to Francis. Then I'll force him to cure this face. Stomp his bloody guts into a fine vintage. And win Vanessa back. 
 OK. Not exactly the plot of Beauty and the Beast, but cool. Good news, that douche thinks you're dead. Advantage you. He won't think you're coming. Bad news, with a puss like that, you'll be spotted fast. 
 (derisive) So what do you suggest?     A mask? 
 Not a bad idea! You... are... haunting. Your face is the stuff of nightmares. 
 (nods) Like a testicle with teeth. 
 How `bout a super-suit? And a nickname! Bitter-Boy. Super-Fist. Captain Never- Die. (deflates at a thought) 
 What? 
 Nothing. It's just... you know, I just realized, I'm never winning the-

 Taxi! 
 Keep the change. 
 Where do you want to be going! 
 (looks to camera) And we all know how this turned out. Cue Benny Hill speed... 
 For your flight. 
 (O.S.) Quit showing off, Angel. 
 Wade Fucking Wilson. 
 Makes perfect sense. 
 I suppose if I looked like him, I'd wear a mask too. (Angel finishes final stitch) Only wish I mended the same. 
 AJAX (CONT'D) Not to worry. We'll put him out of our misery. On our terms. 
 And if he heals? 
 He can't - if there's nothing left of him to heal. And then we go back to business as usual. 
 AJAX (CONT'D) What say we leave the matches at home? 
 There. All caught up. (shifts weight, moans, lies back on futon) 
 (O.S.) Tylenol P.M.? 
 You can stick that where you stuck the Bactine! I found my stash of wisdom- tooth Percocet in the Storjorm, and I'm orbiting Saturn. But I appreciate the gesture. 
 Am I crazy, or is your hand really small? 
 The size of a KFC spork. 
 Eesh. I get why you're so pissy. But your mood's never gonna brighten `til you find this woman you love and tell her how you feel! 
 What do I keep saying, Mrs. Magoo? She wouldn't have me! If you could see me, you'd understand. 
 Love is blind, Wade. 
 No, you're blind. 
 What was that? 
 A clue why our Ivar shelving unit's about to fall the fuck apart. 
 So you're just gonna lie there and whimper? 
 Just clocking time `til this arm plows through puberty. I've got a new Christmas Day. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Now, ya may want to leave the room. (beat) I bet it feels huge in this hand. 
 Wade, we got a problem.    And by we I mean you. 
 I'm about to lose what's left of my shit. Is there a word for half-afraid, half- furious? 
 Afurious? Wait, is it Monday?! They have an amazing Matzah Ball Soup Monday. (beat) Never mind. Have you figured what you're gonna tell her? 
 (thinks) Fuck. 
 It's a start.

 I come for the French Onion Soup. How do you think? I'm constantly stalking that fox. 
 (V.O.) Every time I see her is like the first time. 
 (V.O.) Even from this angle. Especially from this angle. 
 (V.O.) Shittiest moment numero tres. 
 Lezzdothis. Before I re-reconsider. Maximum effort. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Sorry. (tries to dry attendant's sleeve with paper towel) I get very uncomfortable around you guys. (takes mint off counter, then condom off counter, then sees tip jar) Crisp high five? 
 Someone out back asking for you. Said somethin' about an old boyfriend? 
 I knew it was you. 
 VANESSA (CONT'D) With the weird, curvy edges.

 Ripley from `Alien 3'!

 You guys going for a bite?      Early bird special? 
 Like there's something wrong with eating before sundown. Or saving money. But no. It's about me saving my girl from a bad guy, the one you two helped me lose. You do fight bad guys? (off NTW's stare) No time for hard stares, are you gonna fetch big-shiny-balls or not? Tell him I have an offer he can't refuse! 
 Colossus! 
 (O.S.) Is that you, Wade?! I knew you'd see error of ways! 
 Yep, that's me, seeing the error of my ways! I just need an itty bitty favor in return! (turns to camera, whispers) Fool him five times? Shame on him. 92. Deadpool    Final Shooting Script    11/16/15

 Careful, Ronnie Milsap, we're down-range! And we decided on the Orrberg, not the Borgsjo. 
 Shit. 
 She cool? 
 The coolest. Plus, she could never pick you out of a line-up. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) It's Francis. He wants me to come to him. And he calls me a piece of- (squints, can't read)

 That's every piece in the house. 
 Uh-uh-uh. 
 It was him or me. (beat) I did hit it, right? 
 Please. It's been years since you've hit anything. See what I did there? 
 Fuck you. 
 (to Al) In case I never see you again, I love you very much... and there's a hundred-ten million dollars buried somewhere in the apartment. Good luck. Watch your face. 
 Any luck winning Gita back? 
 I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool. But Bandhu is more craftier - and handsomer - than me. 
 (shrugs) It's all relative. 
 (O.S.) Stop the car. I must leave a note. 
 Oh, please. I'll bet the halls of your high school were very well monitored. 
 I cannot be stopping. 
 She indeed has ESPN!    I am quite uninsuranced. 
 You mean ESP. But come on!      I coulda- 
 Gaaaahhhh! 
 Who brought this twinkly man? 
 Twinkly, but deadly. My big Russki friend doesn't like the idea of a whole new army of mutant mutton-heads. And I told him if he did me this solid, I'd consider joining his boy band. 
 It's not a boy band. 
 Sure it's not. 
 (O.S.) Ow!   Help.     Me. 
 Uh.   Dopinder. What was that? 
 Oh, that?      That was Bandhu. 
 Bandwho? 
 My romantic rival, Bandhu. He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, D.P. I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish. Then dump his lifeless corpse on Gita's doorstep like a cat with a dead bird. Mom and Dad will be over the moon. 
 Something must've gotten lost in the translation. (gives surreptitious thumbs up to Dopinder) (MORE) 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Seriously. This is no way to win Gita's heart. Return Bandhu home safe and gentle-like. And then woo Gita with your boyish charm... 
 Fine, fine. Safe and gentle-like.          Here we are... 
 DOPINDER (CONT'D) I too am clairvoyance. I presume a crisp high five? 
 For you?    Ten. 
 Knock em dead, Pool Boy. 
 Time to make the chimichangas. 
 (V.O.) Not often a dude ruins your face. Destroys your living. Grabs your future baby mama. Personally sees to 8 of your 10 shittiest life moments. And plans to lather-rinse-repeat on a buncha new chumps. Let's just say, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas... 
 (to camera) It happens. A'ight, cue up DMX again. 
 (freezes, it's missing) Gahhhhhhh! (pulls out a phone, dials) 
 Bandhu? 
 (hears crash) Goddamnit! Never mind. Nothing that can't be fixed by two swords and... (cracks neck) ...maximum effort. (points to imaginary D.J.) Gimme a beat! 
 (O.S.) No one fires! 
 Long term, that's hard on your knees. 
 (ALT:) Super-hero landing! Clearly you're far too much dude for me. Which is why... (points) ...I brought him. 
 I'd prefer not to hit a woman. So please place your hands behind your- 
 (sighs, points) I also brought her. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I feel sorry for the guy who tries to pressure her into prom sex. 
 Never mind. Fire.

 Hey, fellas, whoa! Hold on!        Don'tcha wanna hear my terms?! 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) You guys only work for that shit-spackled Muppet fart! So I'm gonna give y'all the chance to lay down your firearms in return for preferential - bordering on gentle - possibly even lover-like treatment. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Fine. Commando. (to NTW) Stay down, kid. Unless your power's stopping bullets. 
 Uh... you seem to have, um... 
 Tea-bag! (notices man under him) Bob?!

 That never gets old.    But neither will you.

 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) You were right, babe. (wipes blood off sword) Red is my color. 
 Wade?

 You never left. 
 (to Deadpool) But you did, asshole. 
 You two have a lot to work out. Take a deep breath. Wait. Wrong choice...

 I hope they blocked pain to your every last nerve. `Cause I'm'a go looking.

 Good one. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Let's dance. (beat) And by dance I mean try to kill each other. 
 Yowww! 
 Fine.   Fists. 
 Sounds like your last Saturday night. (smiles) The sense of humor survived. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Since you can't feel it? (holds up an INCISOR) I just knocked out your tooth. 
 I want to liiiiiive! 
 C'mere, ya little bitch.

 If we survive this.   I'm gonna kill you. 
 We have so much to catch up on. 
 You're OK.     Take it slow. 
 I'm good.

 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Wham!   Wham! Wham! 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (thrilled/exhausted) There are no words. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Me and you are headed to fix this face. Or else... 
 Sorry. It's just. All this time, you bought that I have the cure? I'm flattered. But do I really look like the scientist type? You want the guy behind the guy. His name's Dr. Killebrew. And he's long gone. Who knows where. 
 Um.    What? 
 You heard me. 
 You mean to say, after five long years, I've been chasing the wrong monkey? 
 Sounds even stupider when you say it. 
 Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for? (chambers a round) Any last words? Good. I got one: (pulls back the hammer) Francis. 
 (O.S.) Wade! 
 COLOSSUS (CONT'D) Four or five moments. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Four or five moments.      That's all it takes... 
 To...? 
 Be a hero. Everyone thinks it's a full time job. Wake up a hero. Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true. Over a lifetime, there are only four or five moments that really matter. Moments when you're offered a choice. To make a sacrifice. Conquer a flaw. Save a friend. Spare an enemy. 
 COLOSSUS (CONT'D) In those moments, everything else falls away. The way the world sees us. The way we see oursel- 
 COLOSSUS (CONT'D) (dry-heaves again) Huuugglh! Why! 
 You were droning on! (shrugs) I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread, but at least we've heard the last of him. If wearing super-hero tights means sparing psychopaths, maybe I wasn't meant to wear `em. Not everyone monitors a hall like you. 
 Just promise- 
 I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments. (MORE) 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (peers between Colossus and

 (bang) Gratuitous. (bang) Worth it. 
 (to camera) Anyone else turned on? (to Vanessa) That's what I love about y- 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I totally deserved that! (gets punched again) That too! (wards off knee) Maybe not the nethers. 
 Start talking. 
 I'm so sorry. For leaving. And taking so long to cowboy up. It's been a rough few years. 
 (snorts, dismissive) Rough? 
 I live in a crack house. With a family of twelve. At night, we spoon for warmth. Everyone fights for Noelle. She's the fattest. (MORE) 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) There's nothing we don't share.    Floor space. Dental floss. Condoms. 
 So you live in a house! (turns to face him) 
 I woulda found you before now. But the guy behind this mask isn't the same guy you remember. 
 You mean this mask? 
 And this one. In case the other fell off. 
 You mean like this? 
 Oo. Ah.    Quicker - like a Bandaid!    Owww- di 5000. 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Sure? 
 Sure I'm sure. 
 VANESSA (CONT'D) Ew. 
 (devastated) I understand. 
 (smiles) Kidding! Get over yourself!        I'd hit that shit. 
 You already did. (rubs chin) Twice. Seriously? 
 (nods) After a brief adjustment period and one or two drinks. (smiles) It's a face... I'd be happy to sit on. 
 I'm also not the same under these pants. (whispers) Super-penis. 
 Gah! What the hell are you two still doing here?! (to Colossus) You, go clean some chalk-board erasers, or be a... really Big Brother, or teach fat kids to eat lettuce. (to NTW) And you, Chicken Noodle. Well... (freezes) I feel something stupid coming on. (bounces) Gaaaaaaahhhhhh! 
 (STARES, elated) I am?! Omigod. That. Was. Not. Mean! Seriously, guys, it was a pleasure. For a second there, we felt like... like... (we expect `family') ...five mini lion robots forming a large super robot. 
 Now, I meant it, both of you, fire up the Blackbird and shoo! Scram! Vamoose! Skedaddle! Don't make me keep thinking of these!

 (short version) You're still here? It's over! Go home. Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool 2?! Sorry, we're low on dough. But if you can keep a secret, I can tell you who's gonna be in it. Cable! Someone suggested Mel Gibson for the role, buuuut- I was thinking Liam Neeson. Only problem, Liam likes to get paid. And more for Liam means less for me. Maybe we'll crowdfund the shit. Just you and me, kids. Shalom! 
 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (long version) You're still here? It's over! Go home. Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool 2?! Maybe a little Samuel L. Jackson? Sorry, that budget went to Weasel's Ketamine habit. But if you can keep a secret, I can tell you who's gonna be in it. Cable! You're allowed to show your pleasure. I'd love Liam Neeson for the role, but Liam likes to get paid. And more for Liam means less for me. So we'd best crowdfund the shit.

 
 O/S Salim! Salim! 
 V/O Ten to white-out, nine, eight, seven... 
 Are you ready? 
 PREM (CONT'D) I said are you ready? 
 Yes. 
 V/O ...three, two, one, zero. Cue Prem, cue applause... 
 V/O Go, Prem. 
 Welcome to Who Wants To Be A Millionaire! 
 PREM (CONT'D) Please give a warm welcome to our first contestant of the night- a local from our very own Mumbai! 
 PREM (CONT'D) Smile, dammit. 
 Your name, bhen chod. 
 Jamal Malik. 
 So, Jamal, tell us a bit about yourself. 
 V/O I work in a call centre. In Juhu. 
 A Phone-basher! And what type of call centre would this be? 
 XL 5. Mobile phones. 
 Aha! So, you're the man who rings me up every single day of my life with Special Offers, huh? 
 No, actually, I'm an assistant. 
 An Assistant Phone-basher? 
 PREM (CONT'D) And what does an Assistant Phone- basher do, exactly? 
 I- I get tea for people and- 
 - a chi-wallah! Why didn't you say? 
 PREM (CONT'D) So, ladies and gentlemen, Jamal Malik from Mumbai, let's play Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...! 
 Has he confessed, yet? 
 Apart from his name, I can't get a word out of the runt. 
 You've been here all bloody night, Srinivas. What have you been doing? 
 Tough guy. 
 A little electricity will loosen his tongue. 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Every night I get home, "why can't we have a/c like Bajan Chacha? (MORE) 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Why don't you care about your poor family, dying in this heat." Twenty-four years a policeman and I can't afford bloody a/c. 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) But you. You've got ten million rupees ek dum guaranteed, yaar? And who knows how much further? Fancy the twenty million, do you? 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) I think you probably do. 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) So. Were you wired up? A mobile or a pager, correct? Some little hidden gadget? No? A coughing accomplice in the audience? Microchip under the skin, huh? 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Srinivas! Look, it's hot, my wife is giving me hell, I've got a desk full of murderers, rapists, extortionists, assorted bum-bandits...and you. Why don't you save us both a lot of time? Hmm? 
 Sorry, Sir. (CONTINUED) 
 He's coming! Sir. 
 Aré wa, Srinivas, we'll have Amnesty International in here next, peeing their pants about human rights. Get him down, tidy him up, for God's sake. 
 Maybe he did know the answers. 
 Have you gone soft, Srinivas? Professors, lawyers, doctors, General Knowledge Wallahs never get beyond sixteen thousand rupees. And he's on ten million? What the hell can a slum dog possibly know? 
 The answers. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) I know the answers. 
 Jamal! Catch it! Catch it! 
 SALIM (CONT'D) How could you drop that? It was a sitter. 
 Private-ka land! Private-ka land! The planes won't kill you, mader chod, I will! 
 Vinod! Musketeers coming through! 
 WOMAN'S VOICE Jamal! 
 Shit. Mummy-ji. 
 JAMAL'S MOTHER Don't you move a muscle. 
 So, the musketeers return. We are honoured. Salim. Or Porthos, isn't it? 
 I know! 
 And Athos. 
 Not at all, not at all. I hope you will visit us, Commissioner. 
 PREM (CONT'D) Bring the family. It's a lot of fun. 
 (CONT'D) chi, you lazy chutiyé, chi! 
 (CONT'D) Ah, Inspector! Cracked it? 
 Nearly, Sir. 
 Inspector. How good to meet you. Clearly the kid cheated. 
 Clearly, Sir. 
 So, it is just a question of how, no? 
 Indeed, Sir. The proof. That is all we need. 
 We are lucky to have a man of your obvious experience on the case. This kid might run rings around us filmi types, but he won't make fools out of the Mumbai Police Force, I can see that. 
 PREM (CONT'D) In front of sixty million people. 
 PREM (CONT'D) Which is what will happen if we don't get a result, Gentlemen. He goes back on the show to rob us all with the whole of India watching. But. I can rely on you. 
 PREM (CONT'D) Has he- has he made any allegations? 
 Allegations? 
 He's a cunning one. A convincing liar. Don't be taken in, Inspector, don't be taken in. 
 So, Mister Malik, the man who knows the answers. Talk. 
 So, are you ready for your first question for one thousand rupees? 
 Yes. 
 Not bad money to sit in a chair and answer a question. Better than making the tea, no? (CONTINUED) 
 No. Yes. No. 
 No. Yes. No. Apka final answer? 
 PREM (CONT'D) Remember, you have three lifelines if you're not sure of your answer- Ask the Audience, 50/50 and Phone a Friend. So, the question: 
 PREM (CONT'D) Who was the star of the 1973 hit film Zanjeer. Was it A- 
 Immediately, sir. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Bhai, get out of there. Prakash wants a shit. 
 O.S. Not finished. 
 Stop your time-pass. This is urgent. 
 O.S. It's a shy one. Since when was there a time limit on a crap? 
 Since there was a customer waiting, that's when. 
 O.S. (singing/ grunting) Come on out, you beauty, unveil yourself, my darling-warling.... 
 Look, kid, I got a bad stomach. It's borderline.... 
 PRAKASH (CONT'D) I'm off to Devi's bog. Give me that. 
 You just lost me good money, you stupid idiot- 
 It's Amitabh! That's his helicopter! 
 O.S. Amitabh? Amitabh Bacchan? 
 No! Wait! Salim, sala! Salim! 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Wait! Amitabh.... 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Amitabh-ji! Amitabh-ji! 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Please. Amitabh-ji. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) A thousand thanks, Amitabh-ji. 
 It's coming! 
 (singing) Amitabh, Amitabh, oh Amitabh! (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) I have your autograph, oh, holy Amitabh! 
 Here it comes! 
 Sala! Sala! 
 V/O You chose A- Amitabh Bacchan. Guess what? You just won one thousand rupees! 
 You don't have to be a genius. 
 I knew it was Amitabh. 
 Like I said. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) (squealing) He's the most famous man in India...! 
 O/S For four thousand rupees....the national emblem of India is a picture of three lions. What is written underneath? Is it... 
 ...A) The truth alone triumphs. B) Lies alone triumph. C) Fashion alone triumphs. D) Money alone triumphs. 
 PREM (CONT'D) What do we think, Jamal? The most famous phrase in our country's history. Maybe you want to phone a friend? 
 PREM (CONT'D) Or Ask the Audience? I have a hunch they might just know the answer. What do we think? 
 Yes. 
 (startled) Yes? 
 Ask the audience. 
 Well, you're the contestant, Jamal. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 PREM (CONT'D) Put the poor man out of his misery, Ladies and Gentlemen. Press your key-pad now. 
 So, Jamal. My five-year-old daughter knows the answer to that, but you don't. Strange for a millionaire genius. What happened? Your accomplice nip out for a piss, did he? Or did he just not cough loud enough? 
 The Inspector asked you a question. 
 How much is bhelpuri at Jeevan's stall on Chowpatty Beach? 
 What? 
 One bhelpuri. How much? 
 (can't help himself) Ten rupees. 
 Wrong. Fifteen since Divali. Who stole Constable Varma's bicycle outside Dadar Station last Thursday? 
 (amused) You know who that was? 
 Everyone in Juhu knows that. Even five year-olds. 
 I'll give you five hundred rupees if you just admit it. You go home, I go home. Everybody happy. 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) No, you want to go back on the programme and win twenty million rupees, don't you? 
 Wouldn't you? 
 The audience has chosen. And, whaddya know? Ninety-nine percent of them think the answer is A). The truth alone triumphs. What do we think, Jamal? A hundred percent would have made me a little more reassured, maybe.... 
 PREM (CONT'D) Are you married, Jamal? 
 No. 
 Well, don't despair, there's someone out there who thinks our national motto is "Fashion alone triumphs". You two could be very well matched. 
 What the bloody hell is he playing at? He's way off script... 
 Split up with his girl-friend. (CONTINUED) 
 Which one? 
 All three, I heard. Nita as well. Back with the wife. She's pregnant again. 
 Oh, God, that's all we need.... 
 Oh, for Sharukh Khan...Stand by white out. 
 ...won four thousand rupees! 
 PREM (CONT'D) One more question before the commercial break. What will our Call Centre Assistant do next? 
 PREM (CONT'D) Religion! Interesting. For sixteen thousand rupees, in depictions of the God Ram, he is famously holding what in his right hand? Is it A) a flower. B) a scimitar. C) a child or D) a bow and arrow? 
 Hope so. My head is exploding. 
 Yes. We need rain. 
 MOTHER (CONT'D) Run! Jamal, Salim, run! 
 MOTHER (CONT'D) Go! Run! 
 Krishna, quick! 
 No way! You're a bloody Muslim. Get away from me! 
 KRISHNA (CONT'D) They're Muslims! Him and him! 
 Go! 
 Salim! 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Mister Nandha. 
 Ram nam satya hai, Babri Masjid dhvasth hai. 
 Mister Nandha? 
 We have destroyed your mosque. Now, the followers of Ram will drive you dogs out of our city. 
 Let's go, bhai. 
 We should go back. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) See if Ama- 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) What about Jeevan Chacha? 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Maybe he- 
 - I saw him. He was with them. 
 But he wouldn't hurt- 
 - he was with them! 
 But- 
 - shut up, Jamal, can't you? Just shut up! 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Ja! 
 What shall we do? 
 Go away. Ja, ja! 
 SALIM (CONT'D) She'll have the Security Guard onto us, standing there. 
 Not if we let her in. 
 No. 
 She could be the third musketeer. 
 I am the head of this family, now. And I say no. Piss off, you. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) We don't even know what the third musketeer's called. 
 Where's your Mother? 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Father? 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) I'm Jamal. He's Salim. 
 Latika. 
 I wake up every morning wishing I didn't know the answer to that question? If it wasn't for Ram and Allah, I would still have a Mother. 
 D) A bow and arrow. 
 Final answer? 
 Final answer. 
 Computer-ji, D lock kiya-jaye. 
 PREM (CONT'D) Jamal Malik, you answered D? Ram is depicted with a bow and arrow in his hand. And guess what? You've just won sixteen thousand rupees! Well done, my friend. Time for a commercial break- don't go away, now. 
 PREM (CONT'D) Got lucky, huh? I'd take the money. You'll never get the next one. 
 You're from the Juhu slum, aren't you? 
 Hmm? Sure. Know where I live now, kid? Pali Hill. Twelve bedrooms, a/c in every room, two kitchens, a gym and a screening room. Steel balls is what it takes, my friend, steel balls. 
 V/O Prem? Tone it down, for goodness sake. You're making him a laughing stock. 
 We're having fun here. They love it...Where the hell do you get them from? 
 V/O It's supposed to be a quiz show, not a blood sport. 
 Two minutes. 
 Stop wetting your pants. I'll be a good little boy with the next one. Promise. 
 Meet me after the show. Please. 
 No. 
 Nita, I can explain. 
 No need. I read it in bloody Stardust. Didn't even have the balls to tell me. "Prem's happiness with another baby on the way". After everything you said... 
 Baby, it all happened before I met you. I swear to you. 
 She's got the gestation period of an elephant, then. 
 You see? Amidst all this misery, only you can make me laugh. 
 All this misery... 
 Her and I- nothing. You have to believe me, baby... 
 One minute. (CONTINUED) 
 No. I'm not going on. 
 Prem... 
 I can't. Without you, it's all pointless. 
 PREM (CONT'D) You. Tell the Director. 
 Thirty seconds. 
 Prem... 
 Calypso Bar, private room, just you and me? 
 Fifteen. 
 (furious) Alright. 
 Steel balls. 
 PREM (CONT'D) Okay, Juhu boy, you've had a good run. Take your Mother to Khandala and eat some chiki. 
 My Mother's dead. (CONTINUED) 
 Well, your girlfriend then. Even better. 
 I don't have a girl-friend. 
 Live wire like you? You surprise me. 
 Five, four... 
 V/O ....three, two, one... 
 Welcome back to Who Wants to be a Millionaire! Our contestant, Jamal Malik, Call Centre Assistant- from Mumbai, is on sixteen thousand rupees and has already used one lifeline: Ask the Audience. So, my friend: are you ready for the next question? 
 Yes. 
 Then, let's play. 
 PREM (CONT'D) For sixty-four thousand rupees. The British architect Frederick Stevens designed which famous building in India? Is it: A) The Taj Mahal. B) Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. C) India Gate. D) Howrah Bridge. What do you think, Jamal? Are you one of those tea-boys with a penchant for architecture? 
 So, what's it to be? Walk away and this cheque for sixteen thousand rupees is yours. Look, it's even got your name on it. 
 I don't have a bank account. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) But I'll take cash. 
 Nope. Looks like the Producer's stolen my wallet again- 
 - I'll play. 
 You'll play? 
 Why not? 
 Well, well, well. We've got a wild one, here. 
 PREM (CONT'D) For sixty-four thousand rupees, Ladies and Gentlemen, the question once again.... 
 Latika! Latika! 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Latika! 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Latika! 
 V/O Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. 
 V/O Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Sure? 
 V/O I think so. 
 V/O You think so. A brave man, Ladies and Gentlemen, a brave man. 
 Yes. Final answer. Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. 
 Is the right answer! Sixty-four thousand rupees to you, Sir! 
 And did she come back? 
 I wouldn't be here if she had. 
 Pretty was she? 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Guess not. 
 The most beautiful woman in the world. 
 That's the chutiyé out the way. Now, man to man. How did you know all the answers? 
 If I knew, I'd tell you. 
 Now we're into the serious money. For two hundred and fifty thousand rupees, ladies and gentlemen, a quarter of a million rupees...the song Chalo Ri Murali was written by which famous Indian poet. Was it A) Surdas. B) Tulsidas. C) Mira Bai. D) Kabir. Remember you still have two lifelines- fifty- fifty and Phone A Friend. Tempted to use one? 
 No. 
 No? 
 I know this one. 
 Oh. I see. An expert on the poets, huh? 
 Four, nine, zero, nine- the one with the stick going down, Salim- six- stick going up- 
 (whispered) Oi! 
 Six, one, shit, let's go- 
 Got you now, little shits. 
 Aha! Little thief! 
 Useless bloody look-out. What good is she, huh? 
 (infuriated) I tried to warn you. 
 It's okay, Salim. 
 Hello. 
 MAN (CONT'D) Hot, huh? My name is Maman. 
 Anyone hungry? Come on in. 
 He must be a very good man to look after these people. 
 (glancing at them) A saint. 
 We're not allowed to talk to them. 
 Why not? 
 LATIKA (CONT'D) Well, if there are seconds, Maman is definitely a Saint. 
 LATIKA (CONT'D) I tell you, Lord Siva is with us. 
 Stop! You. Again. (CONTINUED) 
 MAMAN (CONT'D) Everyone. 
 MAMAN (CONT'D) You sing like one, and you fight like one. I think you've found your dog, Punnoose. 
 Okay, let's go, let's go! It's not a bloody holiday! 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Give me that. 
 Hey, Salim! 
 What, choté bhai? You got a problem? (CONTINUED) 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Here. For you. 
 I don't want it. 
 You'll earn double. I'm doing you a favour, Latika. 
 She doesn't want it. 
 Chup, Jamal. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) I'll drop it. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Triple if it's crying. 
 Madher chod...! 
 You're dead, sala. 
 Get back to bed, dogs! What the hell... 
 V/O They taught me every song in the history of Indian music. 
 V/O And why would they do that, I wonder? 
 Very good, very good. I am pleased, Arvind. He is ready. 
 Ready? 
 Salim! 
 Okay. Take him out the back. 
 MAMAN (CONT'D) Now the other one. Salim, go get Jamal. 
 What? 
 Gunfighter Number One, isn't that right, Salim? The money, the women, the cars...you want them bad, huh? And why not? 
 MAMAN (CONT'D) The time has come to choose, yaar. The life of a slum dog or the life of a man. A real man. A gunfighter, Salim. 
 MAMAN (CONT'D) Your destiny is in your hands, bhai. You can be me. Or nobody. Understand? 
 Yes, Maman. 
 So, brother, go get Jamal. 
 ...weddings, government things, big parties. If Maman says my voice is ready. Big money. 
 Enough for a room? 
 Easily. Maybe an apartment. 
 Really? 
 That's what Arvind said. On Harbour Road. You, me and Salim. The three musketeers. 
 Harbour Road! We can have ice cream from Babanji's. 
 Every day if we want. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) It's my turn. 
 Good luck, Jamal. 
 So, this is it, hey, bhai? The good life, here we come.... 
 (conversationally) Athos. 
 Porthos? 
 When I say. 
 Jamal, hello. You have done well. It's time for you to- turn professional. 
 Really? 
 Sing me a song, yaar. How about Chalo Ri Murali, huh? My favourite. 
 Fifty rupees. 
 What? 
 (shrugs) I've turned professional. What can I do? 
 Sala...! 
 Go! 
 Jamal! 
 Run! 
 Come on! Faster! 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Take it! Take it! I can't reach... 
 Jamal! 
 Got to go back. We've got to go back. 
 He'll kill us if we go back. Jamal! He was going to take your eyes out- with a bloody spoon! 
 SALIM (CONT'D) She'll be alright. She always is. 
 The question was, for two hundred and fifty thousand rupees: who wrote the famous song Chalo Ri Murali. I should warn you, Jamal: from this question on, if you get the answer wrong you lose everything. So. Are you sure? The life-lines are there.... 
 Surdas. 
 Surdas. Apka final jawab? 
 Yes. 
 Computer-ji, A lock kiya-jaye. 
 PREM (CONT'D) (simply) Guess what? You're right. 
 (shrugging) Blind singers earn double. You know that. 
 And what happened to the girl? They blinded her too? 
 (shakes his head) They had other plans. Though it took me a long, long time to find out. 
 Aré, Jamal... 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Come. 
 Where you going? 
 First class, bhai. Where else? 
 V/O We criss-crossed the country from Rajasthan to Calcutta. Every time we were thrown off we got back on again. This was our home for years. A home with wheels and a whistle. 
 Salim? Is this heaven? 
 You're not dead, Jamal. 
 So what's that? 
 Wow. 
 Some hotel, huh? 
 ...there are five main elements to the Taj. The Darwaza, the main gateway, the Bageecha or garden, the Masjid or mosque, the Naqqar Khana, the rest house and the Rauza or mausoleum. If you would like to follow me, I will show you the ninety-nine names of Allah on Mumtaz's tomb. As before, please remove your shoes. 
 Please, what time is the next tour? 
 Err- 
 - so much waiting around in this damned country. (CONTINUED) 
 No, I- 
 - we're on a very tight schedule, you see, young man. Have to see the Red Fort this afternoon. Would it be possible to show us around now? Obviously we understand it would cost more for just the two of us... 
 But of course, Madam. Please follow me. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) This is....the Taj Mahal. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) The Taj Mahal was built by the Emperor Khurram for his wife Mumtaz who was maximum beautiful woman in the whole world. When she died, the Emperor decided to build this five star hotel for everyone who wanted to visit her tomb...but he died in- in fifteen eighty-seven, before any of the rooms were built. Or the lifts. The swimming pool, however, as you can see was completed on schedule in top class fashion. 
 It says nothing of this in the guide book. 
 With respect, Madam, the guide book is written by a bunch of lazy, good-for-nothing, Indian beggars. 
 Oh. 
 And this, Lady and Gentleman, is burial place of Mumtaz. 
 How did she die? 
 A road traffic accident. 
 Really? 
 Maximum pile-up. 
 (suspicious) I thought she died in child- birth. 
 (nodding sagely) Exactly, Sir. She was on the way to the hospital when it happened. 
 (shrugging) You've seen the way they drive around here... 
 V/O It was the best-paid job I've ever had. 
 This is the Princess Diana seat, Madam. Allow me. 
 O/S Tourist police! 
 Top-class fashion, bottom-class prices! Shoes for all! Shoes for all! 
 V/O And life was good. 
 This is the biggest dhobi ghat in the whole of India, Mister David. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) They say that every man in Uttar Pradesh is wearing a kurta that has been washed here at least one time. 
 Is that so? That's amazing. Let's get a look at this, Adele. 
 Aré, sala! Formula One, Formula One! Pit-stop ka speed, Schumacher ka ishtyle 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Go, go! 
 Woah. What happened here? 
 I give you two tight slaps, mader chod! 
 I don't know! I didn't do it, did I...? Nothing to do with me...get off! 
 Do something, Clark. 
 Well, I- I dunno, I- 
 CLARK (CONT'D) Okay, okay, just cool it. You're insured, aren't you? Jesus Christ... 
 CLARK (CONT'D) You okay? 
 You wanted to see the `real India', Mister David. Here it is. 
 Well, here's a bit of the real America, too, son. 
 (hissing) Oi, Jamal! There's a woman with no panties on over here. 
 Why don't you put it back and listen to the music? (CONTINUED) 
 WOMAN (CONT'D) It's called Orfeo. Orpheus and Eurydice. Orpheus- that one there- is looking for his lover, Eurydice. She died, but he can't live without her. 
 WOMAN (CONT'D) The pain is so bad that he goes to the underworld- the place we go when we die- to try to get her back. 
 You can't do that. Can you? 
 (shrugging) You can in opera. 
 Does he find her? 
 Watch and see. 
 Woah! What are you- Jamal? 
 We have to go, Salim. 
 Go? Go where? (CONTINUED) 
 Bombay. 
 Don't be stupid. We're making good money here. 
 We should have gone a long time ago. 
 Oh, God. Baby brother's in love. With a flat-chested hijra. 
 Latika was one of us. A musketeer. 
 A musketeer...Grow up, Jamal. Look, how was I to know they'd beat you up. Here, you can have some of the cash. Come on... 
 I've got cash. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Dollars. 
 How much? 
 Enough. I'm getting my stuff. 
 Wait! Jamal! Ah, shit! 
 So, my friend: ready for another question. 
 Yes. 
 For a straight one million rupees, Ladies and Gentlemen...On an American One Hundred Dollar Bill there is a portrait of which American statesman? Is it A), George Washington, B) Franklin Roosevelt, C) Benjamin Franklin, D) Abraham Lincoln? 
 PREM (CONT'D) Pay or play, Jamal? All you have to do is stop now and you walk away with a cool quarter of a million rupees. Decide to play, get the answer wrong and you walk away with absolutely nothing. But, get the answer right and you win a million rupees. So. You decide. Pay or play? 
 Okay, he hasn't got a clue. This is going to be a walk-away. Stand by. 
 No, he's going to play with him, first. 
 Get a lot of hundred dollar bills in your line of work, Jamal? 
 The minimum tip for my services. 
 Now I know why my cell phone bill is so high...they pay the chi-wallah in hundred dollar bills! 
 It's C. Benjamin Franklin. 
 Woah! We haven't locked the computer, man. You're going to play? 
 I think I just have. Haven't I? 
 You certainly have. C. Right? 
 Right. C. 
 Not confusing your Franklins? Benjamin for Roosevelt? 
 I've never heard of Roosevelt Franklin. 
 There's a million rupees at stake and he's never heard of Roosevelt Franklin...I can't bear to look. 
 PREM (CONT'D) No, no. Don't you worry, Jamal. You were asked which statesman is depicted on a hundred dollar bill. You said C. Benjamin Franklin. Ladies and Gentlemen... 
 PREM (CONT'D) Jamal Malik- you chose to play not pay. I'm afraid you no longer have two hundred and fifty thousand rupees.... 
 PREM (CONT'D) ...you in fact have one million rupees! 
 Who's on the thousand rupee note? 
 I don't know. 
 It's Gandhi! 
 I've heard of him. 
 Don't get clever or I'll get the electricity out again. 
 They didn't ask me that question. I don't know why. Ask them. 
 Funny, you don't seem that interested in money. 
 Platform Seventeen- 
 V/O Bombay had turned into Mumbai. 
 JAMAL V/O (CONT'D) The orphanage had gone, the slum had gone, the people.... all gone. And everywhere was building, building, building. 
 V/O But I knew she was here. Somewhere she was here. 
 V/O Evenings, I searched. Days, I worked. 
 Room service, good afternoon?... Yes, sir. Two chicken burgers, two fries, one cocoa-cola and one mango lassi and a large bottle of mineral water...Bisleri or Himalayan Spring, Sir?...Certainly, Sir. That will be with you in fifteen minutes, Sir. Thank you. Have a nice day. 
 Two chicken burgers, coke, mango lassi and a bottle of Bisleri. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) I'm going to Chowpatti again, okay? Want to come? 
 For God's sake. You got some disease? You force me back to this shit-hole, we leave our friends, a good life, loads of money- for this. Isn't that enough? 
 We came back to find her. 
 No, you did, Jamal, not me. Me, I don't give a shit about her. Plenty of pussy in Bombay for Salim. Oh, yes, sir! You should come down the Cages on Saturday night instead of searching for your lost love. 
 I'm going to Chowpatti. 
 (impersonating Ram) "I'm going to Chowpatti". There are nineteen million people in this city, Jamal. Forget her. She's history. 
 V/O But she wasn't. 
 Namaste, Sahib. Any kindness you give will be repaid in heaven many times. 
 ARVIND (CONT'D) A fifty. And a hundred! Blessings upon you, Sahib. 
 How do you know? 
 There are many ways of seeing. 
 Here. 
 Dollars. But how many? 
 One hundred. 
 Now you are playing with me, Sahib. 
 No. I swear. 
 What is on it? The pictures. Tell me. 
 A building. With a clock on it. Trees behind it. 
 The other side. Turn it over. 
 A man- it doesn't say his name. He is sort of bald, but has long hair on the sides. 
 (smiling) Benjamin Franklin. My God, my God. Thank you, Sahib. You were generous the first time. But this... (CONTINUED) 
 ARVIND (CONT'D) And without even a song? 
 ARVIND (CONT'D) So you are rich, now, are you, Jamal? I am happy for you. 
 I am so sorry, Arvind. 
 You got away. I didn't. That is all. No, no tears. Tears mock me all the more. 
 Arvind, I am looking for- 
 - how's your voice, Jamal? 
 I don't know. I haven't sung since- since then. Arvind, I- 
 - and your eyes? 
 (surprised) My eyes? My eyes are fine. 
 Then stay away, chutiyé, and count your blessings every morning you open them and see the sun rising. You owe Maman. He doesn't forget. 
 I owe Latika. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Please. Is she alive? Arvind, is she alive? 
 Alive? Oh, she's alive alright. It's your life, Jamal. Pila Street. They call her Cherry, now. 
 Thank you. 
 I will sing at your funeral, yaar. 
 I'm looking for Cherry. 
 No, kid. Not available. Plenty of others. Take a look. 
 I'm Latika's brother. 
 She's still not on the menu. Choose someone else or piss off. 
 Just two minutes to talk to her. 
 Two minutes. 
 Is it her or not? 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Shit, she's sexy, man.... 
 Smile! Flow, flow! You entice with the hands not make chapattis, you gawaar. Again. 
 Jamal? 
 What the hell do you want? 
 Come. Quick. 
 You silly little boys. Get out now while you can. 
 Come with us. 
 Look who we have here, Punnoose. Hello again, Jamal. Salim. Never forget a face. Especially one that I own. 
 Shall I take them to the marshes? 
 Whatever you like. Have fun. Just make sure that you dispose of them properly afterwards. No traces, thank you. 
 MAMAN (CONT'D) You really thought you could just walk in and take my prize away? Have you any idea how much this little virgin is worth, bhen chod? 
 MAMAN (CONT'D) Get them out of here. 
 MAMAN (CONT'D) Please continue, Master-ji. 
 No. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Leave him. Get over there. 
 Let's not be foolish, Salim. Heavy, aren't they? 
 Money. 
 You can have money. Here. 
 MAMAN (CONT'D) Take it. Go. Disappear with your friend and we'll forget all about this. Okay? 
 Maman never forgets. Isn't that right? 
 Oh, Maman can make an exception. 
 Can't take that risk, Maman. Sorry. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Safety catch. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Come on. 
 Shit, there's thousands here. 
 We should be celebrating. 
 You just killed somebody. 
 He was going to kill us. 
 Where did you get the gun? 
 Bought it. Now, I'm going to have to throw this beauty in the sea. 
 You didn't need to kill him. 
 What? Typical. I save your life and you're on at me. All you ever do is mess us up. Whenever you're around- 
 - shut up, can't you? Just shut up. 
 Why can't you just be happy, huh? 
 Happy? 
 You got what you wanted, didn't you? So, let's celebrate. 
 Yeah. Let's celebrate. 
 LATIKA (CONT'D) While we can. 
 Service! 
 Reception! 
 We want a room, boy. Executive Class with smoking. Third floor with balcony. 
 Sea-facing, yaar. 
 Have the bags brought up. 
 Latika? Salim? 
 Room service! 
 307 here. I want a bottle of Johnny Walker Red Label, beer, wine- 
 - chicken. 
 Ah! Chicken.... 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) What kind of chicken? 
 (also dreaming) Tikka Masala. With roti- 
 Naan, chutney, dal- 
 - aloo gobi, rice- 
 LATIKA (CONT'D) Pop Tarts! 
 Hold the line, chutiye. Pop Tarts? 
 On the tv. The commercial. Everybody's happy when they have Pop Tarts. 
 Exactly! A bucket of Pop Tarts, chutiye. 
 Found some lunghi! 
 V/O Stay there. Look away. 
 Atcha, atcha. 
 V/O I'll know if you're looking.... 
 I'm not! 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Where's Salim? 
 Dunno. 
 LATIKA (CONT'D) You're a sweet boy, Jamal. 
 I'm looking for Javed-bhai. 
 Ja, mada chod. He's not looking for you. Ja! 
 I need to see him. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) I killed Maman. I'll kill you too. Easy. 
 You killed him? 
 JAVED (CONT'D) My enemy's enemy is my friend, no? So, come in, friend. 
 Maman's gang will hunt us. You know that? 
 I don't care. 
 Me neither. 
 That dance you were doing. In Pila Street. Show me. 
 You came back for me. 
 Of course. 
 I thought you'd forgotten. 
 I never forgot. Not for one day. I knew I'd find you in the end. It's our destiny. 
 Destiny. Yes. 
 LATIKA (CONT'D) Thank you. 
 Hey. 
 Salim? 
 Come. 
 No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a lot to drink... 
 I am the elder. And I am the boss. For once, you do as I say. 
 No. 
 I saved your bloody life, didn't I? 
 Salim, please- 
 - chup, sali. 
 I am Number One now! 
 Salim, no, no....! 
 Get yourself a room, bhai. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) The man with the Colt 45 says chup. 
 Salim... 
 Now go. Or Gunmaster G-9 will shoot you right between the eyes. Boom. Don't think he won't. You have five seconds. One, two, three, four- 
 O/S Salim... 
 Sir, sir! 
 (eventually) Enlighten us Constable. 
 Accessory to murder, Sir. 
 Only the finest minds in the Mumbai Police Force. 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Go check the files, Constable. 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) You puzzle me, Slumdog. Admitting murder to avoid a charge of fraud is not exactly clever thinking. Now, why would you do that? 
 When somebody asks me a question, I tell them the answer. 
 Where are they? 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Where did they go? 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Please, Sir. Which way? 
 I don't know and I don't care. 
 V/O Ready for another question. 
 V/O Yes. I'm ready. 
 For two and a half million rupees. Ladies and Gentlemen. Cambridge Circus is in which UK City. Is it A) Oxford, B) Leeds, C) Cambridge, D) London. 
 PREM (CONT'D) He's smiling. Why does that worry me? 
 Okay, guys, it's been a big week in UK. Kat is back. 
 She's already back. 
 Bardi...Jamal? 
 Oh. Well. She did come back, then she went away when Alfie split up with her and now she's back again. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) But it looks as if Alfie still fancies Mo after all, so- 
 - thank you, Jamal. Keep up, Bardi. The chi-wallah knows more than you. 
 TEACHER (CONT'D) Okay, it's been super-duper hot for UK this week, so there'll be a lot of chat about that- they love their weather- and there's the festival in Edinburgh- Edinburgh? 
 Scotland. Kilts, castles, err, haggis? Porridge, the Highlands, mountains. Ben- Ben Nevis? 
 2 Detective Taggart. Whisky, Sean Connery! 
 And lochs. Their word for lakes. Good. It's also double bonus time for an upgrade to the `friends and family' package this week, so remember to push for an upgrade... 
 ...Every Call! 
 If they want an upgrade, a new tariff or we're stealing them from the other networks, you take the call. Anything else- 
 MANAGER (CONT'D) No time-wasters on Team Bradford, kid. Leave that to the homosexuals on Tunbridge Wells. 
 MANAGER (CONT'D) Where've you been? Dave on Cornmarket's virtually lost his voice, there's two on Ilkley Moor who've had their hands up for hours. Come on, move it! 
 Two minutes, Jamal. I'm on "Millionaire" duty. 
 Rajneesh... 
 It's my turn, Jamal. I've had my pee breaks. Please. If he comes just keep your head down and pretend you're doing an upgrade on the- 
 - `friends and family'. I know. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Two minutes. 
 ...if you want a chance to be a contestant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, dial the number now. 
 I'd like to be a contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. 
 Bloody bastard. I never get it. 
 You have to dial when Prem says "if". "If you want the chance to be a contestant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire..." That's when they open the lines. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) That's what Anjum in Technical says. He put the system in. 
 So why don't you? 
 V/O Hello? Hello? Have I been transferred again, for God's sake? 
 WOMAN V/O (CONT'D) Hello? Jesus, God, will somebody talk to me? 
 Hello, Mrs... 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) ...Mackintosh from King Gussie. 
 V/O (weary) It's Kingussie, love. Pronounced Kinoosie. 
 Kinoosie? 
 V/O So where are you from? Abroad, I bet. China or somewhere. What good is- 
 - just down the road from your house, Mrs Mackintosh. Next to the loch. 
 V/O (suspicious) Oh aye? Which loch? 
 Loch Big- Loch Ben. Next door to Detective Taggart's flat. 
 V/O Loch Ben? Och, no, hen, that's one of the wee ones up in the Highlands. You're all the way up there? But I bet it rains, eh, hen? 
 Indeed yes, Mrs Mackintosh. I have to wade through a metre of water every morning. 
 V/O No! 
 Yes, yes, Mrs Mackintosh. In my kilt. 
 V/O Och, no, hen. 
 It's alright once I've had my porridge, my haggis and a few Scotch whiskies- and the monsoon's nearly over, so- 
 V/O - and what monsoon would that be? I'd like to speak to your supervisor, son. 
 I don't think that's a good idea. He is a very important man, Mrs Mackintosh- 
 V/O - get me the supervisor on this line now- 
 - and he doesn't like bloody time wasters. 
 V/O Yeah? 
 Salim? 
 V/O Who wants to know? Do you know what bloody time it is? 
 MAN V/O (CONT'D) Huh. Hello? 
 V/O Hello? Hello? Who is this? 
 SALIM V/O (CONT'D) Hey. Is someone screwing with me? 
 SALIM V/O (CONT'D) Who is this? 
 I am calling from XL 5 Communications Sir. As a valued customer, we are offering you a free upgrade with our `friends and- 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Family. 
 V/O Jamal? Is that you? Brother? Where are you, man?...I thought you were dead or something...we had to go, Jamal. Maman's guys. They were searching the hotel...Jamal, say something. Please. 
 Hello, Salim. 
 Ever been to Cambridge? 
 No. 
 Ever been to the circus? 
 No. And I've never been to UK before. But I'll still have a go. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Why not? 
 Can someone call me an ambulance? 
 V/O So, Jamal.... 
 I can't remember. 
 You can't remember. Does that mean you did know? Once? 
 I don't think it's Oxford. 
 Based on your extensive travelling, right? 
 (almost to himself) Well, Oxford has Broad Street, Saint Aldates, Turl Street, Queen Street, The High and Magdalene Bridge- which is pronounced Maudlin, so- 
 I thought you hadn't been to UK. 
 Oh, I haven't. And it's not Leeds, because that's Elland Road, Kirkgate Market, Commercial Street, St Peter's- 
 (icy) - what might it be then, Jamal? 
 Well, I don't think it's Cambridge. 
 Cambridge Circus is not in Cambridge? Dare I ask why? 
 Too obvious. There's definitely an Oxford Circus in London, and there's a rowing race between Oxford and Cambridge so there's probably a Cambridge Circus too. I'll go for D) London. 
 That's the logic that's got him this far, Ladies and Gentlemen. Who are we to argue? So. Jamal. D. Apka final jawab? 
 (shrugs) If the Gods are with me...Final answer. D. 
 Computer-ji, D lock kiya-jaye. 
 PREM (CONT'D) It's been a rollercoaster ride all the way, a pleasure to have you on the show, my friend, but I'm sorry to say that you're....incredibly, absolutely right! 
 PREM (CONT'D) Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal Malik, the man with two and a half million rupees! 
 PREM (CONT'D) A few hours ago, you were fetching tea for the phone- wallahs. Now you are richer than they ever will ever be. What a player, Ladies and Gentleman! What a player. 
 PREM (CONT'D) For five million rupees, my friend: who invented the revolver? Was it A) Samuel Colt, B) Bruce Browning, C Dan Wesson or D) James Revolver? 
 (suddenly) A). Samuel Colt. (CONTINUED) 
 A). Samuel Colt. Are you sure? 
 PREM (CONT'D) Final answer? 
 Final answer. 
 You had two and a half million rupees. If I may-? 
 PREM (CONT'D) Ladies and Gentlemen, the chi- wallah has done it again! D. Is right! Incredible! 
 Not that incredible. You'd just murdered somebody with a Colt 45, after all. 
 It was self-defence. 
 Let's call it manslaughter, then, shall we? 
 Getting hot in here, isn't it? 
 (genuinely) Are you nervous? 
 What? Am I nervous? You're the one who's in the hot seat, my friend. 
 Oh. Yes. Sorry. 
 Bloody hell. He's got Prem on the run... 
 What sports do you play? 
 None. 
 None. Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear. Not to worry, there's only ten million rupees at stake... Which cricketer has scored the most first class centuries in history. Was it A) Sachin Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C) Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs. 
 PREM (CONT'D) You've got a cheque for five million rupees in your hands. You've still got two life-lines, Phone A Friend and 50/50. For ten million rupees: pay, play, or bail out. It's still an option. Remember, if you get the answer wrong, you will lose everything like that. 
 PREM (CONT'D) Are you sure you want to do this? 
 I'll play. 
 The dreams of so many. On the floor. 
 Jamal! 
 SALIM (CONT'D) God is good, bhai. God is good. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Maman's boys were after us. Had to skip. 
 Liar. 
 Left a message at reception. Waited weeks for you in Nagpur. 
 There was no message at reception. 
 Bhai, I left a message. 
 I will never forgive you. 
 I know. 
 Can you believe it? This was our slum. We lived just there, huh? Now it is business, apartments, call centres...Fuck USA, fuck China. India is at the centre of the world, now, bhai. And I am at the centre of the centre, Jamal. This is all Javed-bhai's. 
 Javed Mehta? The Gangster from our slum? You work for him? 
 Who else would protect us from Maman's gang, huh? 
 What do you do for him? 
 Anything he asks. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) He is coming. You must go. My card. 
 What for? 
 You think I am going to let you out of my sight again, little brother? You stay with me now. Ab phut! 
 Salim, where's Latika? 
 Still? She's gone, Jamal. Long gone. Now go. Quick. 
 V/O Slum dogs never sleep, only nap. He would disappear for a couple of days and come back changed. Sometimes elated- 
 He has flipped! I can't do anything with him.... 
 Look at it, bhai, look at it! 
 V/O Sometimes the opposite. 
 (whispering) Aé khuda mujhé baksh dé mainé bahut gunaah kiyé hain.... 
 V/O But younger brothers don't interfere. Mostly. 
 Baba, I am the new cook from the agency. A thousand apologies, I am late for the Memsaab. 
 DOOR-KEEPER She doesn't know anything about any cook. There's supposed to be a dishwasher being delivered. Know anything about that? 
 Baba, I am your dishwasher! 
 Haven't I told you, don't interrupt when I'm watching- 
 LATIKA (CONT'D) - come inside. I'll show you the kitchen. 
 (delighted) Jamal, Jamal, look at you...! 
 LATIKA (CONT'D) Aré wa, Jamal.... 
 You've hurt your eye. 
 Why are you here? 
 To see you. 
 Well. You see me. 
 Why does everyone love this programme? 
 It's the chance to escape, isn't it? Walk into another life. Doesn't everyone want that? 
 You have another life. A rich one. 
 Who'd have thought it possible? A slum dog, with all this. 
 Are you happy? 
 I have five star food, five star clothes. I sleep in a bed, not on the street. From where we come from, Jamal, that is happiness. 
 You don't look so happy with a black eye. 
 You turn up here out of nowhere, telling me I'm not happy: how dare you? 
 LATIKA (CONT'D) God, Javed will kill you. Here. 
 Javed? You are with him? 
 First you want a dishwasher, now a bloody cook- 
 -I just thought- 
 - chup. The cricket's on. 
 JAVED (CONT'D) Why do you always watch that shit? Huh? I'm already a millionaire. (CONTINUED) 
 JAVED (CONT'D) Well, come on then, Cook. I'm hungry. Get me a sandwich. 
 Immediately, Sir. 
 Atcha... 
 Come away with me. 
 Chutiyé. Away where? And live on what? What can you provide? What have you got, Jamal? 
 Love. 
 (on the mobile) ..yeah. He's on eighty-five. I want four lakh on him making a century. What are you giving?...Okay, make it five lakh. 
 We are watching history unfold today at the Wankhedé Stadium as Sachin Tendulkar carves his way towards another magnificent century and the record books. His thirty-eighth century- the most by any Indian cricketer ever... 
 Love. That will feed us, will it? 
 It won't buy you a new dishwasher, but it might make you happy. (CONTINUED) 
 Where have you been? Get in the real world, Jamal. 
 You and me. That is the real world. Come away with me. 
 You're crazy. 
 Salim will help us. 
 Salim? You still believe in Salim? Jamal...I'll be gone soon, anyway. Bombay's got too dangerous for- 
 Where? 
 You think he'd tell me? 
 Straight bat, straight bat, dammit. 
 JAVED (CONT'D) No! A single! 
 JAVED (CONT'D) No, no, no! stupid ben chod idiot... 
 JAVED (CONT'D) And what is this shit supposed to be, mader chod? Get out. Get out! 
 Now go, before he kills us both. 
 Latika, where's my bloody shirt? The Armani. 
 Coming! 
 LATIKA (CONT'D) (whispered) You want to do something for me? 
 Anything. 
 Then forget me. 
 I'll wait at VT station. Five o'clock every day until you come. 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) I love you. 
 So what, Jamal? So what? (loudly) Now, get out and tell your no- good agency not to send anybody else until they've learnt to cook. You hear? 
 DOOR-KEEPER Madam, your dishwasher has arrived. 
 Why can't you let it alone? You want money, I'll give you money. Girls? I can get you girls. 
 You know what I want. 
 You're like some crazy man- you're obsessed. 
 She is my destiny, Salim. 
 Know what your destiny is, crazy boy? A bullet between the eyes. And after that, he'll kill her. Is that what you want? Huh? 
 Me, I don't care. Latika? She's already half dead. 
 Yes. About that, you are right. 
 You sold her. 
 (fierce) I didn't sell her. Javed wanted her. He gets what he wants. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) She's doing alright. Get it into your thick head, Jamal. She's not yours and she never will be. 
 Time for a commercial break, Ladies and Gentlemen. I know, I know, I can't stand the tension either. Don't even think about leaving your seat. We'll be back. (CONTINUED) 
 PREM (CONT'D) You've got the luck of the devil, yaar, I'll give you that. 
 I- I need to- 
 Oh, the toilet. Sure. Naveed, Jamal wants the bog. 
 A guy from the slums becomes a millionaire overnight. You know the only other person who's done that? Me. I know what it's like. I know what you've been through. 
 O/S I'm not going to become a milionaire. I don't know the answer. (CONTINUED) 
 (laughs) You've said that before, yaar. 
 O/S No, I really don't. 
 What? You can't take the money and run now. You're on the edge of history, kid! 
 O/S I don't see what else I can do. 
 Maybe it is written, my friend. You're going to win this. Trust me, you're going to win. 
 V/O Twenty seconds. 
 Latika! Latika! 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Latika! 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Latika! Latika! 
 JAMAL (CONT'D) Latika! Latika! 
 Salim! 
 V/O Fifteen seconds. 
 Do the right thing and in approximately three minutes you will be as famous as me. 
 V/O Ten seconds. 
 And as rich as me. 
 V/O Five seconds. 
 Almost. 
 V/O Four, three... 
 From rags to Raja. It's your destiny. 
 V/O ...we're on. 
 Welcome back to Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? In the chair tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we don't know! In an amazing run, Jamal has already five million rupees but, not content with that, has chosen to gamble for one Crore- that's ten million million rupees. What a player! The question one more time: Which cricketer has scored the most first class centuries in history. Was it A) Sachin Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C) Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs. 
 I know it isn't Sachin Tendulkar. 
 That's a start. So, it could be Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or Michael Slater. 
 I'll use a life-line. Fifty- fifty. 
 Okay. Computer, take away two wrong answers. 
 PREM (CONT'D) Well, you were right about Sachin Tendulkar. The computer has taken away A) Sachin Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater. That leaves you a fifty-fifty choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you think? Decision time. For half a million rupees. Your answer: B) Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs. 
 D. 
 You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting? The Australian? Great cricketer. 
 D. Jack Hobbs. 
 Do you know? 
 PREM (CONT'D) So it could be B, Ricky Ponting? 
 Or D. Jack Hobbs. 
 Final Answer? 
 Final Answer. D. 
 Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye. 
 PREM (CONT'D) With one hundred and ninety- seven first class centuries, the answer is...D. Jack Hobbs! 
 PREM (CONT'D) Jamal Malik, Crorepati! 
 PREM (CONT'D) I cannot believe what I am seeing here, tonight, Ladies and Gentlemen....So, are you ready for the final question for two Crore rupees- twenty million rupees? 
 Not really, but...maybe it is written, no? 
 Maybe, indeed. Okay, okay. For twenty million rupees, the final question on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? 
 PREM (CONT'D) Ohhhhh! Just when I thought I would need a pacemaker fitted, we're out of time! What a show, Ladies and Gentlemen, what a show. Join us tomorrow night to see if Jamal Malik has made the biggest mistake of his life or has just won the biggest prize in the history of Indian television....Same place, same time. You wouldn't dare miss it. Goodnight! 
 Latika! 
 DOOR-KEEPER Told you. 
 Where? Where is she? 
 DOOR-KEEPER Dunno. 
 Where? 
 DOOR-KEEPER I don't know! Wouldn't say, would they? They had to get out fast. The police. Honestly. 
 Where are you? Where is she? 
 Where you'll never find her. Or me. You could have joined us, you bloody idiot, been one of us. You've lost everything now. Everything. 
 Salim...! 
 O/S ...if you want a chance to play Who Wants to be a Millionaire, call now...! 
 This way, Jamal, this way. Great show, my friend. See you tomorrow, huh? 
 What's going on? 
 He's a cheat. 
 This was you? You called them? 
 DIRECTOR (CONT'D) How d'you know he's cheating? 
 Oh, come on! Of course he is. He's a bloody village boy. Even when I fed him the wrong answer the little shit got it right. 
 You gave him an answer? 
 Well, I didn't exactly- 
 PREM (CONT'D) Nita? 
 It is all bizarrely plausible. And yet... 
 Because I am a slum dog, chi- wallah, I am a liar, right? 
 Most of you are. 
 Shooting at Pila Street, October 19th...Maman Hossani....Victim pronounced dead at scene. Suspects absconded: two males, early teens, one female, early teen. 
 But you: you're not a liar, Mister Malik, that is for sure. You are too truthful. 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Thank you, Constable. All that remains is to work out whether it was manslaughter or murder. Ten years, or life. 
 The Commissioner's here, Sir. 
 ....behind the walls of this police station lies the mystery all of India is talking about. Did Jamal Malik, an uneducated, eighteen year-old boy from the slums of Mumbai win one Crore rupees by fair means or foul? And in the crowds all around me there is an even bigger question. Will he be back on the show tonight to play for twenty million rupees... 
 I- progress is being made sir. 
 No, Sir. 
 That's-? 
 Whilst I'm not convinced he actually cheated, I have got- 
 A liar. 
 INSPECTOR (CONT'D) Indeed, sir. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Sir-? 
 Not a word, Srinivas. 
 What about my bloody whisky, woman? 
 JAVED (CONT'D) Hey, Salim. 
 We're out. I'll just get- Syed. 
 (to himself) Final answer? 
 That boy. He will never give up. Never. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Crazy chutiyé. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Ja. Go. 
 But- 
 - just drive. There won't be another chance. Go. 
 He'll kill you. 
 It is not written. 
 O/S Salim! 
 Salim, I....can't. 
 You have to. It'll take you two hours if you drive fast. Here. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) For God's sake, hold on to it. (CONTINUED) 
 SALIM (CONT'D) For what I have done, please forgive me. 
 SALIM (CONT'D) Go. Have a good life. 
 You're back on the show. 
 Who knows? 
 Crorepati! Crorepati! 
 Oi! Get back to work. 
 MANAGER (CONT'D) The chi-wallah? 
 Good luck. 
 V/O Two minutes. 
 Hey. Sweetheart. What about me? I'm sweating, here. 
 You should be. 
 So. Tonight. The Calypso Bar. 
 Not if you were the only man in the world. 
 (genuinely puzzled) But I am the only man in the world. 
 Come on, come on! 
 Welcome back to Who Wants to be a Millionaire? I can safely say that tonight is the biggest night of both of our lives, Ladies and Gentlemen. Jamal Malik, the Call Centre worker from Mumbai has already won one Crore rupees, a cool ten million. Tonight, he can walk away with that in his pocket or make the biggest gamble in television history and go for the final question and a staggering twenty million rupees! Jamal, are you ready for that question? 
 Yes. 
 Big reader, are you Jamal? A lover of literature? 
 I can read. 
 Lucky! In Alexandre Dumas' book, The Three Musketeers, two of the musketeers are called Athos and Porthos. What was the name of the third musketeer. Was it A) Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu, C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet. 
 The final question, for twenty million rupees: and he's smiling. I guess you know the answer. 
 Would you believe it? I don't. 
 You don't? So, you're going to take the ten million and walk? 
 No. 
 No? 
 I'll play. 
 You just said you don't know the answer. I heard that, right? You do understand that if you get the answer wrong, you lose everything? Ten million rupees. A fortune, Jamal. 
 I'd like to phone a friend. 
 We're going to the wire, Ladies and Gentlemen, we are going to the wire. The final Life-line. Here we go.... 
 It's ringing. 
 Doesn't look as if your friend is in, Jamal. Who is it? 
 My brother's number, but- 
 - the sort of brother who'd go for a walk on the twenty million rupee question? 
 It's the only number I know.

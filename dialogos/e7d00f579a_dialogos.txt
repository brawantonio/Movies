 
 
 (voice over) Labor Day weekend. Some time for a sanitation strike. Everybody crazy to stock up. They decide to score at the last minute and want it now. Never fails. The faces look alike. You gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity -- it keeps you sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. I started writing after that. Not every night -- now and then. Just to burn off the night. Fill up one book, throw it out, start another. 
 
 Darling. 
 Ann. 
 Have we made New York safe for another weekend? 
 (waves) Robert. 
 Get a job. 
 (about ROBERT) Sad what ten years without sex can do. 
 Any hundreds? 
 Twenties -- and tens. 
 Tens! 
 Goddamn cash machines. 
 Did what's-his-name give you a hard time? 
 (out of shot) You mean --? 
 Yeah. 
 Cash Before Delivery. (re-emerges) 
. 
 Fucking investment bankers. 
 These Wall Street kids deal with fake money all day, they think cash is a theoretical concept -- like it doesn't apply. I see 'em at two, shudder to think at nine they're buying and selling -- turned me off the stock market. 
 It's late. (to ROBERT) You staying? 
 It's over. 
 I'm gonna crash -- try, at least. 
 (to LETOUR) Tomorrow will be easier. Maybe we can all eat together. Go on. You look tired. Here, take a couple of C's. I'll pick up anything that comes in. 
 Sleep tight. 
 Pick up the trash. 
 (laughs) Yeah -- big kiss. 
 JOHN'S APARTMENT 
 (voice over) "Labor Day." "Union Movement" -- there's a contradiction in terms. I know about long hours. It's worse when I'm off -- I just walk and walk. Where am I going? There's an element of providence to it all. Like rolling numbers. Luck. You're walking down the street, some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick-up four hours ago, there's an APB description out and a cop pulls you in cause he's cold and wants to go inside -- they grab your stash. Your number's up. You're busted for nothing. For bad luck. 
 Don't bore me. 
 (overlap) Jees -- 
 We pay you more, you put up with more. White drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety. 
 Never made any big money either. 
 She blows it. 
 She always says that. We'll see, Jealous. 
 No way. I'm not the management type. I get in charge, I'll start using again -- not for me. I know music people. I'm gonna get in recording. 
 What? 
 Why? 
 (shrugs) I look like an encyclopedia? Who knows? (opens door) Thanks for the warning. 
 Jack. 
 You pick up from Jealous? 
 (passes bag) Yeah, nineteen grams after four times last night. We're certainly not his favorite people. 
 We don't make the laws. Nineteen is carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him be stupid. 
 He took my hundreds. 
 (stands) Take over for a while. I'm getting contact high. 
 (sits) Who's Her Majesty talking to? 
 The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona. She's trying to get them to come here -- or, better, Europe. 
 That's where the money is. 
 All mark-up -- the "Big One." 
 (laughs) Don't dress. (beat) You really think she means it? 
 That's what she says. New Year's Eve and out -- no Acid House, no product, no deliveries. 
 That's just her mouth talking. 
 Next year -- strictly Akasha. 
 "Akasha"? 
 Cosmetics. That's what Ann's calling the company now -- 
 (interjects) -- this week. I don't get it -- marigolds, violets, sage -- why'd anyone pay to put weeds on their face? 
 Why'd anyone pay to put them up their nose? I like cosmetics. I need cosmetics. You should come in with us. 
 You forget: she hasn't asked me. 
 (out of shot) Johnny! Robert! Come here! 
 (open arms) Plant me two kisses, boys, fifteen hundred Ex at thirty each and the delivery's here. 
 (to LETOUR) Whatja think? 
 Of what? 
 The face cream. Almond, marigold, chamomile, egg, aloe -- the "Almilk" formula. I remixed it. 
 (smells her) Very nice. 
 Reminds me, if you get downtown stop at Enhancements and pick up some almond oil -- not the California. (fishes menus from desk) What should we order? 
 How about Indian? 
 Darling, it's Saturday. 
 Thai. We haven't had Thai in a while. 
 ANN'S VOICE "Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a message, we'll get back to you -- sooner than you think." 
 (to ROBERT) Answer that. He'll call back every five minutes. 
 (walking) The night begins. 
 "Ped Srilom"? -- it's Northeastern. Duck. 
 (glancing) I'm going veggie. Get me the "Puk Ob." 
 (out of shot from phone) Me too. 
 Use it for facial cream. 
 (out of shot) Remove unsightly hair! 
 Laugh, one day you'll be watching me on "Oprah" from a welfare hotel. 
 Forgive us. 
 (returns) Eddie wants now. Now. His place. Top Lady. God knows what happened to his shit yesterday. 
 (to LETOUR) You take it -- call in. 
 It was supposed to be light tonight. 
 Don't you watch TV? 
 Don't have one. 
 Well if you were the normal stupid fuck you should be so lucky to be and had one, you'd know it's supposed to rain -- 
 Good for the trees -- 
 Some farmer whacked his numerology on us. 
 (peers through curtain) It's started. 
 The Farmer's Almanac is based on numerology. 
 Raining? 
 Take a coat. (to ROBERT) And you, clean up the product before the food delivery comes. 
 
 Le Tour! -- finally. What took so long? 
 (steps inside) Traffic. It's raining. 
 How's things? 
 Okay. 
 I need a quarter -- you got it? 
 (nods) Robert said he sold you a quarter yesterday. 
 (slurs) Some friends came over. How much is that? Fourteen-hundred? 
 Eddie. Look at yourself. Sit down. I've known you, what, like eight years? 
 (counting) Yeah... 
 Knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife -- remember her? We used to sit and talk and talk -- 
 (whining) You don't know what she was like -- 
 This is no good. I'll sell you a gram and some downs, but I ain't gonna put you in the emergency room. Cool it. Go to bed. Sleep it off. 
 (stands) You charge $200 for what goes for ninety on the street -- and you're not gonna sell? 
 (clicks beeper) So go to the street. 
 I'll call Ann. 
 Go ahead. You know what she'll say. Phone's over there. 
 (irrational) I'll tell the fucking cops. 
 (flashes cold) Fuck you. That's it. You're out. (turns to leave) Don't call again. Catch you next lifetime. 
 (contrite) Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right. I didn't mean that. I'm quitting anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry. 
 (turns back) Okay. 
 Two hundred? 
 You got downs? (EDDIE nods) One more thing. I gotta use the phone. 
 (checks his watch) I've got to go. 
 (Voice over) Everybody wants to talk. It's like a compulsion. My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. They figure you can tell a D.D. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. He understands. Of course they're stoned to start. If I could tie together all the hours of coke talk I've heard, that would be a lot of string. It was Robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. Fifty is more like it. 
 C'mon, Tour, stick around. 
 Yeah. 
 There's only four of us and like seven of them -- and we're paying for the dope. See her, over there, the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? -- she's gonna model for Elite. 
 (smiling) Me? I'm an old man. She'd break me like an old horse. 
 Shit, dude -- 
 Nah. Thanks anyway. (checks watch) I gotta go. Have fun. (heads toward exit) 
 (to DRIVER) Carlos. Wait a second. 
 Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I'll give you a ride. 
 John. John LeTour. 
 (recognizes him) John? 
 Get in. You're getting soaked. 
 (awkward) Hi... 
 Where are you going? 
 I didn't know you still lived here. 
 (second thoughts) Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I should get out. 
 Don't be crazy. It's pouring. 
 I'm not supposed to be around -- 
 (completes sentence) -- former drug associates. 
 It's four years I'm clean. No alcohol, no cigarettes, no nothing. 
 I heard. I'm happy for you. 
 It's still not easy. 
 I know. Mar, you don't need to avoid me. I'm straight -- two years. It came that time. I tried to tell you. I wrote. I called. 
 (looks around) I should get out. 
 Honest. 
 But you're dealing. 
 No. I stopped. 
 What's in the bag? 
 Almond oil. You can check. (opens bag) Look. 
 Shit. 
 What's that for? In case someone needs almond oil in the middle of the night? 
 I still deal a little, but I'm straight -- that part's true. Believe me. 
 (to DRIVER) Stop here. Now. Stop! 
 I won't say anything. I promise. I'll just sit here. I'll just give you a ride. 
 Goodbye, John. 
 Where do you live? (door slams) Mari... 
 Sir? 
 Eighty-third Street. 
 
 
 (out of shot) Coffee? 
 (out of shot) Thanks. 
 (out of shot) Black? 
 (out of shot) Yeah. 
 (out of shot) Here. 
 I'm not sure how this works. 
 Have you ever been to a psychic before? 
 No, but I've, well, I've heard about it. 
 Do you need advice? John? 
 (nods) No... it's not that... I don't know -- I just decided to come. I thought... 
 Be comfortable. (smile) How did you hear about me? 
 A recommendation. Somebody from work. Two hundred dollars, right? 
 It's a lot of money? 
 I don't care. 
 (explaining) I look at you. I give you my impressions. I feel your "vibrations" -- I don't like that word, it sounds phony, but I can't think of anything better. (watching) You're anxious. (he shrugs) More than usual. Your aura is very strong. I feel a very strong vibration from you. A change is coming. You're worried about money. You say you don't care about money but that's not true. 
 Yeah. 
 Your livelihood is endangered. You're worried about the future. You don't have much money saved. What will you do? 
 I don't know. 
 I see a woman who has betrayed you. 
 (smiles) My mother? 
 (cuts him short) Who will betray you. 
 Not... I... 
 Keep it in mind. I have a strong feeling about this woman, a woman close to you, she will betray you. You're in the entertainment business, aren't you? 
 Yes. 
 But you're not happy. You want to do something else. Is it music? 
 Yes... 
 You have a talent for music. 
 As a child. 
 You still have it. It's strong. I see music in your future. A career opportunity will come in the music field. Take it. It won't seem promising. Take it anyway. (pause) You're full of stress. Are you exercising? 
 No. I -- 
 You should exercise more. You must let go of this stress. It's not good for your health. I'm not saying you're going over to the other side, but it's not good for you. You're still drinking, aren't you? You have a drinking problem? (he shrugs) It's interfering with your health and your life too. You've had other problems. Drug addiction. 
 Yes. 
 This was very important in your life. 
 Yes. 
 You are in the balance. Everything you do -- positive or negative -- in this life is a drop that will carry over in the next. Every act, every decision matters. 
 Teresa? 
 What is it? 
 I'm thirty-eight years old. (beat) Forty. 
 You're young. 
 I have trouble sleeping. (TERESA waits) Look. What do you see around me? Is there anything? Is it dark? Have I run out of luck? Is there luck? 
 I see a glow. Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you. 
 
 (to LETOUR and ROBERT) Your pay's on the table. 
 (dialogue punctuates action) One hundred thirty-one, let's make it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small bills. One percent commission, $130 to you -- add tens or whatever if you want. 
 Same time? 
 (nods) Two weeks -- don't run. Stay a while. We'll order kosher. We'll tell you dirty stories. We'll talk Zionism. 
 (passes hundreds) I'm late already. I only come 'cause I like you. Sure you're not Jewish? I don't want to see you hurt. Find a man. You should do something else. 
 (offers commission) Invest in my cosmetics line. 
 (takes money) Don't mix business with friendship. 
 Shalom. 
 Shalom. (opens door) See you next week. (calls after him) Don't eat any hot dogs! 
 Jealous said something about a yuppie murder in the Park. You know anything about it? 
 It's all over the news. 
 Jealous said to be careful. 
 We are careful. 
 (returning) We're too small time. Besides, she wasn't one of ours -- not directly. (to LETOUR) Tis is at St. Luke's. He wants somebody over right away. Second floor waiting room. 
 A hospital? What's he doing there? 
 He says he needs you to come to St. Luke's. I'd go but I got the other thing. 
 The --? 
 Yeah. 
 (to LETOUR) Go. Keep on his good side. He set up Arizona. 
 (to LETOUR) Let's have lunch. Tomorrow. 
 Me? 
 One o'clock. Côte Basque. Is that too early? 
 No. Yeah -- sure. 
 Tonight? 
 I vote Japanese. 
 Fine. 
 Okay. 
 (heads for door) Mixed sushi. Oshitashi. 
 ST. LUKE'S 
 What's going on? 
 You got some valiums? 
 (nods) -- 'n 'ludes. 
 Just a valium -- a ten. 
 What is it? 
 You won't believe it. What a nightmare. I brought in this chick. She O.D.ed -- man, I didn't even know her. I didn't have to bring her in. The cops are coming back to talk to me. I'm hyper. I gotta come down. 
 (hands him valium) Here. 
 Make it two. 
 Thanks. 
 She okay? 
 Who? 
 The girl. 
 Yeah, yeah. Met her last night. A walking vacuum cleaner. What a nightmare. Underage. 
 You need a lawyer? 
 (gestures toward suited man) He's here. Thanks. 
 Any time. 
 John! 
 Randi? 
 (kisses him) I can't believe it. Marianne's here too. She flew in. It's been so long. You look great. 
 (deactivates beeper) You too. Randi, what's wrong? Why are you here? 
 Mom. She's back in. Didn't Marianne tell you? 
 Serious? 
 (nods) More chemo. 
 Can I see her? 
 She's sleeping. She sleeps most of the time. She'd like it, though. She still talks about you. 
 (sad) I'm so sorry. She's a terrific woman. I was crazy about her. God. 
 It's John. What a coincidence. 
 (gathering herself) Yes. (extends hand) Hi. 
 (shakes hand) Randi told me about your mom. I'm sorry. 
 Thanks. 
 She's sedated? 
 Yeah. 
 She would be so happy to see John. 
 I don't think that would be a good idea. 
 You both look so tired. 
 One of us has to be here. 
 The hospital lets us stay in her room. 
 Let me buy you some coffee or something -- the cafeteria's downstairs. It helps to talk. 
 You go, Marianne, it's my turn with mom. 
 I shouldn't. 
 Go. You haven't eaten. Go on. (nudges her) Go on. 
 I... 
 Bring me a coffee. 
 This way. (to RANDI) Kiss your mother for me. 
 
 I like your mom. 
 She liked you. You know this will happen someday, but when it does... Your mother -- that was a shock. 
 (re: Marianne's mother) She's been sick a while? 
 A year. 
 Your father? 
 ("no") Not this time. His new wife -- he'll make it to the funeral. 
 What have you been doing? Where do you live? 
 It's... (deciding) I don't want you to know about my life. 
 Anything? You married? Have children? A dog? (smile) House plants? 
 Details just open the door. 
 The door to what? (no answer) It's not like we're strangers. We were married. 
 We were not. 
 There was a ceremony. 
 He wasn't even a minister. He was an astrologer. 
 He was also a minister. "Universal Harmony." 
 He was a Pisces. 
 You're a Pisces. 
 It was not legal. 
 In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're still -- 
 I was on the cusp. 
 We were happy. 
 We were miserable. We were either scoring or coming down -- mostly coming down. 
 There were good times. Area, out on the street, laughing, dancing with friends -- we were magical. 
 You took off for three months without telling me and called once. That's how magical we were. You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- I heard them all. Nobody could clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a gift from God. 
 You exaggerate. 
 In rehab they call this "euphoric recall." You only remember the highs, never the lows. 
 We were happy. 
 I was drowning. 
 It wasn't me -- 
 You watched -- 
 You jumped -- 
 You did nothing -- "It wasn't your business, you weren't responsible" -- you still think like that. (shakes head) Actions have consequences; so do -- 
 (overlap) I -- 
 -- inactions. 
 I didn't -- (MARIANNE smiles) I meant well. 
 You always meant well. 
 We were in love? 
 Yes. 
 We were happy? 
 You bought it for me. It's inscribed inside. 
 Ann's quitting. I've got to find something else to do. 
 Ann? I'll believe it when I see it. 
 It's true. 
 Are you really straight? 
 Yeah. 
 Let me see your eyes. 
 Eyes are deceiving. (beat) Congratulations. 
 If I could do that, I could do anything. 
 What do you mean? 
 We could do anything. We could start over. 
 (bangs her head) What was that? I think I heard something. 
 I'm serious. 
 You're crazy. 
 (gestures to room) This is crazy. 
 I have to get back. 
 I'll walk you. 
 
 (voice over) I can always find another way to make a living. I never planned this in the first place -- not like Ann. She came up to sell, have parties, make contacts. She was so glamorous. I just wanted to be around her. She'd sit up listening to coke stories. Now it's me and Robert. The whole crowd was the same age. Everybody's younger now. She made me. 
 CÔTE BASQUE 
 You have any money saved? 
 There's some. Not much. A thousand or two. Maybe more -- I'm not sure. 
 What do you do with your money? 
 I don't know. It's not that much in the first place -- as you know. 
 (counterpoint) It's tax free -- 
 Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs -- what about your money? 
 Kitty Ford once told me, "Ann, the only person I know that lives as well as you is my grandmother." All the money I've made, all the money I've spent -- it never adds up. This last two years cosmetics' been taking everything. 
 I wish I could help. 
 You still go to meetings? 
 No, but I'm okay. What are the odds of meeting someone you haven't seen in years twice in two days? 
 Ask Robert to make up a chart for you; the other person -- who is it? 
 Just a contact -- you don't know him. 
 What's the plan? 
 The plan? 
 What you gonna do? 
 My future? 
 Too conceptual? 
 We had this conversation two years ago. We'll have it two years from now. 
 This time it's for real. 
 (accepting premise) I'm thinking of some music courses. Mixing, sound editing -- 
 You took that before. 
 That was acting. 
 (corrects him) Modeling. 
 Why all this concern? Suddenly you care? 
 I have feelings too -- you may have noticed. I guess I'm worried. I'm tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this business, it's one thing to act tough -- I've seen Zipporah twice this week. 
 She helps you? 
 (nods) -- harmonizes, she's encouraging me to get out of this into the cosmetics thing -- 
 (about CUSTOMER) Nomination for Best Picture. I knew every girl he fucked -- how, why. I knew when he had trouble shitting. Like this. (crosses fingers) His wife says he gets straight or she cuts him off. Old money. I remember the last thing he said to me: "See you soon." Yeah, sure. That was five years ago. 
 (vulnerable) You'll still talk to me, won't you? 
 You --? (to ANN) Of course I will. 
 It'll be strange without you around. I hadn't thought of it -- it hit me. 
 (clever) We'll always have Paris. 
 (reproachful) John. 
 Ann, you want me, call, write a letter, tell a wino -- I'll be there. 
 
 (soft) I'm sorry. I... 
 (after a moment) I always thought my father would die first. He would die, then my mother and I would reconcile. Just her and me. I hated him for living. 
 It's like a joke. It's not a real feeling. It's like a feeling of a feeling. 
 My old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded. (beat) I miss you. 
 You tried to kill me. You took ten years of my life one way or another. (he kisses her) I couldn't hate my mom -- I was too busy hating you. 
 I thought I was just killing myself. 
 Selfish. 
 I remember. 
 What? 
 What it felt like. (kisses his face) What this tasted like. 
 I see you and my heart starts thumping. 
 John. 
 Excuse us. (to MARIANNE) Let's go. 
 Come. Come with me. 
 
 Have you ever had sex totally straight? 
 Not with you. 
 Neither have I. 
 Such an erection. 
 Never had anything like it stoned. Feel it. (she does) 
 Weird. 
 (caresses erection) Wow. 
 I'm dripping. 
 Let's disappear. 
 Kiss, kiss, kiss. 
 Kiss, kiss, kiss. 
 Together. 
 (waking) You need to go back? 
 This is the end. It was wonderful. I'm glad it happened this way. It will never happen again. You will not see me, you will not call me again. I'm happy for you. I wish you the best. I'm leaving. I'm going back to the hospital. I shouldn't have left -- but I don't regret it. Please dress and leave as soon as possible. I have a key. Goodbye. 
 Marianne... 
 It's my fault. 
 I love you. 
 Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two hours: where have you bee? 
 There was a mix-up -- 
 How you gonna survive on your own? The U.N.'s got some conference in two days. The holiday's over -- ragheads everywhere trying to score. U.N. security at every hotel -- little creeps with lapel pins. Even I've been out. This is where our money is: Europe, Asia, not the streets -- you wouldn't know crack from crackerjacks. 
 Where's Robert? 
 Busting his ass. He's out doing your job. 
 It was a confusion. 
 Get confused on your day off. 
 When is that? 
 Don't get wise. What do you want me to do? Suck your dick? -- okay. A raise? No way. Get out there. There's a list on the TV. I love you. Get your ass outta here before I kiss it. 
 (pecks her cheek) I'm on my way. Love you. Forgive me. 
 
 Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this is Gabri, Tasha -- you know Thomas. They're here for a show. 
 Enchanté. (to TIS) How'd it turn out? 
 (to GABRI) Questo è un vero Americano. (to LETOUR) What? 
 St. Luke's. 
 No problem, but -- can you believe this? -- she's out of the hospital in one day, calls me up, wants to "get together." Some people are just born for losing. Want to go in back? 
 Not now. 
 Huh? 
 Look at the bar. Black-haired guy, late twenties, brown suit, drinking tonic? (TIS nods) He's casing you. Not me, you. Undercover, whatever -- he's on you. 
 You know him? 
 (shakes head "no") Just a feeling. You holding? 
 No. Need help? 
 ("no") Leave a message. Robert or I will come by later. 
 Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway. (to MODELS) Who am I trying to impress? (they smile uncomprehendingly) Make it tomorrow. A half -- no, three- quarters. 
 Nineteen is the top. I'll make two trips. 
 Nineteen is fine. 
 (leaving) A domani. Take care, girls. 
 (voice over) I feel my life turning. All it needed was a direction. You drift from day to day, years go by. Suddenly there is a direction. What a strange thing to happen halfway through your life. 
 (out of shot) Paramount Hotel. 
 Marianne Jost, please. 
 (out of shot) Just a moment. 
 "Welcome to the Paramount. Your party is out. If you would like to leave a message for -- (Marianne's voice) 
 'MARIANNE JOST' (back to message) -- please do so after the beep." 
 
 (out of shot) Paramount Hotel. 
 Marianne Jost. 
 (out of shot) Just a moment. 
 (out of shot) I'm sorry. Ms. Jost checked out this morning. 
 She was there yesterday. 
 (out of shot) She checked out this morning. 
 Did she leave a forwarding number? 
 (out of shot) No. 
 Thank you. 
 Mrs. Jost. JoAnn Jost. She's a patient. 
 (out of shot) Who is this calling? 
 (thinking) Skyline Floral. We're trying to confirm a delivery. 
 (out of shot) Mrs. Jost passed away last night. 
 Are the funeral arrangements local? 
 (out of shot) Just a sec -- yes, Plaza Memorial. 
 Thank you. 
 (out of shot) You're welcome. 
 
 Can I help you, officer? 
 What? 
 I hope I haven't made a mistake. You are a cop, aren't you? 
 Yes. 
 Could I see a badge? 
 (shows credentials) Bill Guidone. 
 What is it? 
 You think you're invisible, don't you? You think we don't know you, LeTour -- that's the name you use, right? 
 My father's a partner in a powerful law firm. If you have anything in mind, do it by the book. 
 (in his face) You? Who the fuck cares about you? I could grind you right here! -- maybe I will! -- and nobody would give a fuck! You're not worth the paperwork. I look like Narcotics? I'm Homicide -- I'm investigating the Park murder. 
 (acquiescent) I don't follow the news. 
 Downtown's interested how a Barnard honors student with fancy parents got a quarter of uncut coke on her when she was murdered. I mean, we just don't see this girl cruising Alphabet City trying to score. Somebody sold her, somebody upscale and classy -- you're classy, I hear -- and that somebody knows something we need to know. (hand inside LeTour's shirt, pinching his tit) Delivery boy! 
 I wish I could help. I don't even know who's president. 
 Let me put it this way. Here's my card (hands card) Ask around, take a week or so. Call me. Tell me something I don't know. Either that, leave town, or get your ass busted day in, day out. 
 
 Get out. 
 Marianne... 
 (emotion rising) Every time you come into my life something terrible happens. I thought I was rid of you. How'd you get here? I don't want you here! I don't want you around me, I don't want you around my mother! Damn you! 
 Marianne... 
 (wild) Get out! 
 I didn't... 
 I'm sorry. That's the way it is. You shouldn't have come. Marianne has been up all night, crying and crying. She wasn't there when Mother passed -- died -- she blames herself. It wouldn't have made any difference. She just slipped away. Marianne's -- I'm worried -- 
 It's... 
 Don't try. 
 How are you? 
 Me? 
 Yes, you. I can't think of anything, but if there was anything I could do... 
 Thanks. I'm okay -- I guess. I mean, we've been expecting it. It'll hit me later. 
 I saw her. 
 Who? 
 Your mother. I came in the room. You were sleeping. I just watched. 
 Oh. (beat) I'd better get back. Marianne's probably flipping out. 
 ON A ROLL 
 Have some shu mai. Just delivered. 
 No. 
 (entering) I told Ann you'd be on time. Tis called. He said before ten. He said you were right. 
 About what? 
 An undercover cop. Not a narc. The Park murder. Jealous was straight on that -- you hear anything? 
 Remember the time that cop called here? Wanted to know if we had "nose candy"? (laughs) Ann says, "John Candy?" "John Candy?" 
 What's wrong baby? You like like shit. Something wrong? (holds his face) 
 No. 
 You can't fool me. I can read you. 
 (distressed) What do you care? You're leaving me. A few more months -- sayonara. (to ROBERT) You too. John who? What was his name again? Le --? (to ANN: pained) I mean it's not exactly like I got a pension plan. 
 (hurt) Jack. 
 (takes his hands) Johnny, it's not that at all. Is that what you think? You hate cosmetics. You don't care about it. You told me that. 
 I know. 
 Who knows what will happen? 
 I got a friend -- a D.D. -- got into lapidary. I'll introduce you. You have to pass a test. 
 Lapi --? 
 Gems, you know, crystals, diamonds. 
 Any more about the Park murder? 
 (re: murder) What's with this thing? 
 Stay away. 
 (genuine) You want in? We'll make a place for you. 
 No. 
 It's -- 
 (out of shot -- answering machine) "Ann, this is Ed. You gotta come. The other thing is over. I'll be home all night. 749-2876." 
 Shit. 
 (unequivocal) Don't answer it. Let him call all night. He's trouble. I don't want to deal with him. 
 It's alright, I'll go. Let me handle it. 
 I'm sorry if -- 
 (about EDDIE) He gives you shit -- fuck him. 
 (to ROBERT) Forget it. 
 We're going Chinese tonight, okay? I mean we're on a roll -- 
 Spring roll. 
 (preparing to leave) Sure, whatever. Surprise me. 
 
 (on floor) You gotta get permission? Check with Mama? 
 I'm calling your brother. 
 Huh? 
 Yeah, the lawyer in Bronxville. I'm gonna ask him to come over. (EDDIE protests) You've told me so much about him. 
 (panicked) No, don't. Please, I'll give you money, anything. He doesn't understand. Whose side are you on? 
 (on phone) Is this Martin Jeer? (beat) Thank you. 
 I shoulda never called. 
 (to EDDIE) I recommend Hazelden. It has the best all-around program. (on phone) Martin Jeer? (beat) I'm here with your brother Ed. (beat) Yeah, in the city. I'm afraid there's a medical emergency. You're going to have to come. 
 (on phone) He'll be here. 
 
 Tour, just in time. We were out. Nineteen, right? 
 Thirty-eight hundred -- got any hundreds? 
 Some, not the whole thing. (to THOMAS) You got hundreds? 
 No. 
 I like that about Ann. Always takes the time to grind it. If you do it, do it right. 
 (to MARIANNE) Looks like you could use some help. (MARIANNE looks up, sees JOHN, goes pale) Mari, this is Tour. You got any hundreds? 
 Not the talkative type. Haven't seen her in years. You know her, don't you? (no answer. counts the money, offers it. LETOUR is frozen) Why they call me? What a nightmare. (extending money) You want it or not? 
 (vacant) Yeah. 
 See you later. 
 Get back! 
 Who saw it? What happened? (the FEMALE COP bends over Marianne's body) EMS is on the way. 
 Too late -- 
 Where to? 
 What? 
 Where to, sir? Where are we going? 
 Nowhere just now. Wait. 
 (after a moment) You want me to wait here? 
 Yes. 
 Downtown. 
 Yes. 
 (out of shot -- radio) This story is just in. A woman has fallen thirty stories to her death from a posh Grace Towers apartment on Lexington Avenue. Police are withholding identification pending the notification of the next of kin. The incident happened about ten p.m. According to the sources on the scene there was no one else in the posh Grace Towers apartment when the fall occurred. We will bring you more details as we get them. (teletype efx) An end to the sanitation strike seems imminent. Negotiations at the Helmsley Palace are continuing to this hour... 
 
 (out of shot) Who is it? 
 John. John LeTour. Can I see you? 
 (out of shot) What time is it? 
 It's important, Teresa. 
 (out of shot) Call. Make an appointment. 
 Open the door. You're awake anyway. (no answer) Teresa. 
 Read me. What do you see? 
 Do I know you? 
 We had a session last week. What do you see? 
 (remembering name) John? 
 Yes. Look at me. 
 Step back. (he does) Again. (he does) Death. 
 Someone I knew died tonight. 
 This was not an accident. This person was murdered. 
 Am I in danger? 
 (beat) There is danger around you. It's very close. I'm sleepy. 
 What should I do? 
 I can't see it. 
 Please. (she shrugs) Am I lucky? 
 Yes. Don't be afraid. Go home. 
 What do I owe you? 
 Nothing. Forget it. Let me sleep. 
 
 (out of shot) Ninth Precinct. 
 Bill Guidone, please. Homicide. 
 (out of shot) Hold on. 
 (out of shot) Guidone. 
 This is John LeTour. Remember me? 
 (out of shot) Laundromat. Your father's got connections. 
 You said I should ask around, tell you something you didn't know. 
 (out of shot) I thought you'd call. 
 It ain't much, but it's something. 
 (out of shot) Go on. 
 A girl died last night. Lexington Ave. 
 (out of shot) The jumper. Druggie. 
 The news said she was alone in the apartment when she went out -- she wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was someone else. 
 (out of shot) Who? 
 Who lives in the apartment? 
 (out of shot) You there? 
 That's all I know. You asked me to tell you something. I told you something. 
 A 
 (out of shot) Who is it? 
 Jack. Let me in. 
 Where have you been? We were worried. 
 I need some sleep -- not much. I don't want to go home just yet. A little sleep first. Can I crash here? Nice place. 
 It's hideous. I did it years ago. I've got to throw everything out. You haven't been here? (noticing TONY) Oh, Jack, this is Tony. I told you about him. You should talk. He's the lapidopterist -- gems. 
 (corrects him) Lapidarian. 
 Same thing. 
 Can I? 
 Sure. 
 What do you know about Tis? What's his relationship to Ann? 
 They go way back -- before me. Did you cross him? 
 No. 
 Don't. He's Ann's Ecstasy connection. She needs that score. What happened? 
 Nothing. 
 Don't mess with him. 
 Is he dangerous? 
 Everybody's dangerous. We heard what you did to Eddie. Ann thought it was great. She was afraid that was why you didn't come back. 
 It was something else. Tell me if you hear anything. 
 About what? 
 Tis. 
 Tis who? Ann says you want a chart done. (beat) What's wrong? 
 (internal) Ah... 
 (sympathetic) You down? 
 (nods) Yeah... (culling thoughts) You ever think about it? 
 What? 
 That it'd be like this -- like, your life, you... that it would turn out this way? -- 
 Compared to what? My thinking this or that is going to make any difference? There's a plan unfolding. "Will my plane crash?" "Does life have meaning?" -- why ask me? Thinking's a fear of living, negative living; living's something else. You're afraid. Let the plan unfold. Stop. Stop, live one day -- one day -- 
 -- Robert -- 
 -- day at a time. 
 (touches ROBERT) You've lost your fucking brain. 
 (laughs) I'm a drug dealer. 
 Got a tub? 
 (gestures) Yeah. 
 Great. 
 There's a plastic bottle of bath oil in the cabinet. Yellow. Use it -- tell me what you think. It's a new formula. 
 JUMP-OFFS 
 Manny. (MANUEL, thirtyish, Puerto Rican, looks closer, trying to place) LeTour. (helping out) Jealous. "Jell." SOB's. 
 (remembering) Reggae night. 
 Burning Spear. 
 How'd you get in? 
 C-C. 
 You buying? 
 How's product? 
 (gesture: "primo") How much? 
 I got a problem. I need a piece. 
 Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy? 
 A gun. 
 When? 
 Now. Anything. (MANUEL is silent) Am I speaking too fast? 
 How much you spend? 
 The rate. What you got? 
 He's got a 64 Smith-son. Detective Special. Nobody wants 'em. Fresh from a cop. 
 How much? 
 (consults DOMINICAN) Four -- including me. 
 You're fucking me. 
 ("so what?") Street price. 
 Where is it? 
 Sigame. 
 The hundreds -- Franklins. 
 How do you use this? 
 Automatic. 
 I don't have much use for a gun. Never used one like this. 
 (translates for DOMINICAN) Cono! 
 (businesslike) What do you do? 
 Simple. You put the bullets in -- (inserts cartridge) you point it at the bad guys, pull the trigger and they fall down! 
 Vaya con Dios. 
 -- Dios. 
 Have you been to the police station? 
 (nods) She was back on drugs. Really back. They're gonna bring her here too. My God. (he comforts her) I thought she was playing for attention. 
 I didn't know. 
 You're not to blame. Don't blame yourself. You weren't responsible. She was always -- she loved you. 
 (wipes tear from her cheek) She loved you. You were what she wanted to be. 
 She scared me. 
 Look. Do you recognize anyone? 
 Tis. 
 You know him? 
 His father's a lawyer. Did some tax things for Mom. He was at the hospital. What's that smell? 
 It's me. Cologne. I'm a sucker for that cheap airplane stuff. Did Marianne mention him yesterday? 
 ("no") It was his apartment. What are you thinking? 
 I don't know. 
 She jumped. (LETOUR hangs on every word) You loved her, but she -- this sounds terrible but it's true -- she was... she ruined everything... bad luck. 
 (heard enough) When's the funeral -- your mother's? 
 Tomorrow. Will you come? 
 (vague) Well, I got this thing to do. It's -- I don't know if I can get away. 
 Try? For me. 
 I'll try. 
 
 The Prodigal Son. 
 Sorry about last night. Something came up. 
 Where were you? 
 T.C.T.E. 
 "Too Complicated To Explain." 
 (enters bedroom) I'm $500 short from last night. I'll get it, you can take it from my salary. 
 (stung) This is family. Are you saying that to hurt me? (LETOUR returns) It's not money. 
 (chagrined) Sorry. 
 Look at this. ("Akasha" visual) We had a graphic artist make it up -- you know, Billy, Five Towns. 
 The label for the cosmetics line. 
 (examines it) Classy. Sorta -- Katmandu... 
 (corrects him) Kathmandu. 
 I love it. 
 Tis called twice. He wants you to come by. 
 (wary) Me? 
 Yeah. Says you were supposed to show up again yesterday, but didn't. 
 A lie. I don't want to go. The suicide and all. Let's stay away. 
 Can't. He's the Ecstasy connect. No way I can fuck this. 
 C'mon... 
 This is business. 
 Let Robert go. 
 Tis won't deal with fags. 
 Since when? 
 Just is -- so he's a bigot? What's new? So's everybody else. 
 I don't want to go. I got a bad vibe. 
 He said you. 
 (to LETOUR) Why? 
 (to ANN) Why don't you go? He's your contact. 
 He is -- 
 (to ROBERT) You giving orders? 
 (deferential) No, Missy. 
 (testing her) Come with me -- the two of us. 
 (upbeat) Okay. You got it. Like old times -- Ann and Johnny. (turns to go) 
 Okay. 
 Stop it. You're breaking my heart. 
 
 It's going to be strange, not doing this. I mean I've had it, but sometimes... 
 You're gonna do it, aren't you? You're gonna quit. 
 (nods) I think so. Seal this thing with Tis, turn it -- go with the cosmetics. You gotta take a chance in life. No risk, no gain. I've already got retail connections here, London. It was great at the beginning, though. 
 When? 
 You know, when we first started out of the place on Greene Street. Before deliveries, when you were still using. It was open house every night but Sunday. We had everything: uppers, downers, meth, six kinds of hash, all in that trousseau, remember? You could get in for a gram, stay all night -- everybody, music people, movies, Wall Street, fashion -- even politics. I think like five marriages came out of those parties, babies -- really. God. (JOHN eyes her: why this Niagara, this nostalgia?) You stayed, you then Robert -- but he... I'da never thought you'd, what is it, twelve years? Others, lucky a year max, eight months, in, out, start using, unreliable -- nice kids. Remember when you first came: long hair, dirty fingers -- 
 (overlapping) You made me -- 
 -- never washed -- 
 -- khaki pants. 
 I should write a book someday. Did you know somebody wanted to do my story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible, of course -- my lawyer freaked I even had the meeting. People envy me. They think my life is so glamorous, but they don't know. I know. Glamorous. (beat) It was for a while. Then came crack and fucked everything. 
 I gotta stop home a second. 
 Why? It's out of the way. They're expecting you. 
 You know I got a bad vibe about Tis. 
 (unconvincing) Chill. This is routine. 
 I want to get my lucky jacket. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 That took long enough. What did you do, douche while you were at it? 
 Ann, you got some mouth on you. 
 You don't want to know where it's been. (sniffs him) Cologne? 
 For you. 
 Phew. It smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. It's no good for your skin. All chemicals. 
 What's that? 
 Do me a favor. 
 What? 
 Don't ask why, just promise. 
 What is it? 
 (testing again) If anything happens to me -- if I should like, you know, fucking die -- write and tell her. 
 It's my sister. Her husband's in San Quentin. She worries, you know. 
 (eye contact) Okay. 
 I thought we were going to Tis'? 
 We are. He's here. He can't very well work out of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he? 
 SHOOT-OUT 
 (on phone) Mathis Bruge, please. (beat) Tis? Ann. I'm here with Tour. (beat) Okay. (hangs up) 
 Tis there? 
 Twelve-oh-four. 
 (Jesus-to-Judas) Ann. 
 I told you greasy fucks I don't deal with guns! I see guns, I walk! How dare you? 
 And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass! (she spits on his shirt, knees him in the crotch, yanks his gun, throws it beside the gut- clutching CUBAN. She crosses the room, YELLING:) That's it! TIS! Shitball! I know you're fucking there! Let this be a lesson! You wanna deal, you gonna apologize for this! (to LETOUR) Let's go. 
 (pointing gun) Hold it! Stop right there. 
 (to THOMAS) No! (to ANN) Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I was just trying to make a point -- I apologize. 
 (about THOMAS and 
) Assholes. What a nightmare. (to ANN) We'll make the deal tomorrow -- same terms. Ann. Sorry. Go on, leave, you're upset. I just need to talk to Tour a second. About a police matter. (to LETOUR) Right? 
 (to ANN) Go on. 
 Tour and I need to get our stories straight. Somebody's talking to the police. The guns were for emphasis, to make a point, dumb -- 
 (to TIS) We came together, we're leaving together. (to LETOUR) Johnny, come with me. 
 (a command) Thomas. 
 (to ANN) Don't be stupid. Get out. Leave. (to LETOUR) I had nothing to do with Marianne -- she jumped: she was there, then she was gone. (nods ANN to leave) Nothing will happen to Tour. 
 (out of shot) Fire! Fire! Fire! 
 (desperate) I didn't -- 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 Twenty minutes. You look terrific. 
 I look respectable. Any news? 
 Sentencing's in ten days -- supposed to be. Because of the extenuating circumstances -- our cooperation -- they say it won't be more than five years -- maybe seven. With time served, good behavior, parole, I could be out in two years -- maybe. I hope. 
 It feels like forever. 
 It's not so bad. It's a relief in a way -- at least so far. I've been writing, reading. 
 I love your letters. (pause) 
 How's business? 
 Robert quit. He went back to dealing. I think he thought it would be less work, more money. It's lucky in a way I got mixed up in it -- now I have to see this thing through. So it's cosmetics after all. 
 (affectionate) I miss you. 
 Me too. 
 Did we ever fuck? 
 What do you mean? 
 You know, make love. 
 (thinks) There was that party when everybody was so stoned, but -- oh yeah, that night you came over and crashed and we slept together. 
 We were naked, but did we --? 
 You had a hard-on... 
 I didn't -- 
 You tried... 
 I was thinking about it and I realized we never really did. It's one of the things I think about. It's one of the things I look forward to. I've been looking forward. 
 Me too. 
 (touches her hand) Something can be right in front of you and you can't see it.

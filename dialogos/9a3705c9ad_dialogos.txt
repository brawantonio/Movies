 In a time of great strife, a legendary interdimensional being known as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against evil.  with the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an unstoppable fighting force.  In time of great need, the young heroes could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as "Zords".  while the identity of the six remained a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of Legend, earning them the title...  The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. 
 YeeeoowwWWWWW!!! 
 We're OUTTA here!! 
 Once we hit the target zone we've got fifteen seconds to make the drop. 
  (0 . S .) Step aside, pinheads. 
 The Stealth Eagle is about to fly. 
 Ditto for the Swooping Swallow. 
 Lead on, flyboys. 
 Bulk... where'd the earth go? 
 Aisha  you' re  on ! 
 Stylin! 
 On your tail! 
 Surf's up! 
 Be the eagle.  Be the eagle. 
 Be the swallow.  Be the swallow... 
!! 
 
 Let's BREAK!! 
 MR. KELMAN Okay, so the firemen landed four out of six inside the target -- 
 How `bout a show tune?! 
 MR. KELMAN Somebody wanna keep chose bowlers in line. 
 MR. KELMAN Ladies and gentlemen, it's Angel Grove High 
 MR. KELMAN And that's one!  A perfect landing! 
 MR. KELMAN Three for three.  Look at `em go! 
 MR. KELMAN That's five perfect landings! Now it's all up to Tommy Oliver. 
 Touch down. 
 Thanks, man. 
 MR. KELMAN Congratulations - the Observatory's got a new lease on life. 
 Who's up for lunch? 
 You read my mind. 
 Let's roll! 
. 
 
 Stealth Eagle, huh?  The Lame Duck is more like it! 
 Let's take the shortcut! 
. 
 #2 Whadda you figure it is?! 
 #1 Hey, ya got me. 
 CONSTRUCTION  WORKER  # 1 ... I'll be damned. 
 #1 
! 
 We're here at the World Center Construction Site, where a mysterious object was just uncovered in a freak accident in which one workman suffered minor injuries... 
 ... Angel Grove Police have cordoned off the area until it can be determined whether or not the unidentified object poses any threat.  The injured workman was quoted as saying... 
 It's one smooth move and then you've gotta explode off the top. 
 Nice and easy. 
 Hey, no Karate on the patio! 
 Well Tae-Kwan-Do-it some place else. 
 So, what're the plans for the weekend? 
 I heard that! 
 That's right - Ryan's Comet. 
 We should throw a little comet shindig. 
 Any excuse for a party. 
 The Eagle has landed. 
 The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye. 
 We could smell it's breath. 
 There's a spot over there. 
 5 (V.O.) Rangers, we need you at the Command  Center,  L.R.N. ! 
 We're on our way. 
 What's happening? 
 5 Ay,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi !  Our thermionic-sensors have been hit by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil! 
 Rangers, you must act swiftly. The planet is in GRAVE danger! 
 Six thousand years ago a morphological being known as Ivan Ooze, ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror. Finally, a rebel factor known as the "Order of the Meledon" lured him into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground. 
 5 In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove. 
 The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released! 
 5 To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices. 
 Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension. 
 Another Saturday night and I'm traipsing around the galaxy with the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother warned me this would happen! Rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel.  Why didn't I listen to her?! 
 That's a good question. 
 No need to wake him.  In fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself. 
 Hey bonehead, get off my hoof! 
 After two thousand years of searching...  I have finally found you. 
 Yo, earth to Bigfoot! 
 Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball! 
 
! 
 Mordant's my second cousin three times removed on my mother's side.  He`s just visiting for the summer. 
 Well put a muzzle on him! 
 What... you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of 
! 
 Don't you ever have anything nice to say?! 
 Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you! 
 Boss. 
 For your information this is not just your average, run-of-the- mill tub of snot ! 
 You're trying to tell me there`re different levels of snot?! 
 Boss. 
 WHAT! 
. 
 Ahhhhhhhh. 
 Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE is back!! 
 He's so cute. 
 I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of all that is good and decent.  It is a supreme honor to finally meet you. 
 How can I ever repay you? 
 Do you recall the name...  Zordon of Eltare? 
 Seems to ring a bell. 
 I want you to destroy Zordon, so that my evil may once again reign 
. 
 Finally, a real man. 
 Here's his address. 
 It's like a freeway.  How long have  you  been  locked  up? ! 
 We shall leave you to weave your wicked ways. 
 Now we go out on the town.  First dinner, then dancing, then -- 
 What is that odious stench? 
 Smell's like...   TEENAGERS! 
 Anybody see anything? 
 ... Let's take a look over there. 
 (O.S.} Hey! 
 You had me scared there. 
 Makes two of us. 
 The only thing I've seen is you teenagers. (beat) And you know... if there's one thing in the world I reeeeally hate.... 
. 
 It's TEENAGERS 
 You're too kind.  Allow me to introduce myself.  I am the infamous, world-reviled, universally despised, OOZE! 
 Well, pack your bags cause we're sending you back where you came from! 
 Gee, a teenager with a big mouth. Not much has changed in six thousand years. 
 We're the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! 
 Ooooh, where's my autoqraph book?. 
 Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is still using a bunch of rug-rats to do his dirty work.  And speaking of rats... 
 From this moment forth, the world as you know it SHALL CEASE TO 
! 
 WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE! 
 He's  gone. 
 Let's take these beasts!! 
 Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here! 
 5 Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin! 
 5 Well...  ALMOST nobody. 
 Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.  I guess if you invest your money well over SIXTY centuries you can buy something pretty nice. 
 5 
 HI ,  YAH ! 
  5 Welcome to Wiener World.  May I take your order, please? 
 You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself. 
 Put a cork in it "Z" .  Ten minutes out of the egg and I'm already listening to one of your lectures. 
! 
 It worked for six thousand years. 
 Don't remind me! 
 Do you have any idea what it's like to be cooped up in a rotten egg for six thousand years?  It's BORING!  Not to mention I've had a Charlie horse since the Renaissance!  But now the tables are turned.  Now... 
 
 ... it's time to pay the PIPER! 
 Oh, the things that I have missed.  The BLACK PLAGUE! 
 
 And now, finally, I have the strength to DESTROY your pathetic powers FOREVER!! 
 YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS! 
 I've got a NEWS flash for you LIGHT-BRIGHT -- I ALREADY HAVE! 
 5 You put your left probe in, you put your left probe out, you put your left probe in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey- pokey and you turn yourself around... 
 IT'S MORPHIN TIME! 
! 
! 
 
! 
 
! 
 SABER TOOTH TIGER! 
 
! 
 
! 
 Let's teach these vermin a few manners. 
 Activating Power Beam! 
 PAGES 21 ONWARDS 
 Hold it... 
 Anybody see them? 
 Activating Power Scope! 
 THEY'RE ABOVE US!! 
 Hey, handsome! 
 My mistake. 
 
? 
 We've got company. 
 Rats!  I hate rats! 
 Bad move, Willard! 
 
 STEGA-STINGER! 
 Coming through! 
 Target Neutralized? 
. 
 Na na na na na! 
 Fried mice, anyone? 
 We'd better get back. 
 Come on, guys... 
 Guys! 
 5 I'll GET you my pretty, and your little DOG toa!! 
 ... What's happening to him?' 
 ...  Rangers... thank goodness you're safe. 
 We have to get you back inside your time warp. 
 I'm afraid that's impossible... The power has been destroyed. It's gone... The Zords, the weapons...  all of it. (beat) The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are no more. 
 ... You must be strong... Ivan almost overthrew the planet once...  and now I'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through. 
 5 I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham! I do not like them, Sam-I-am! 
 5 Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!! 
 5 Thanks, Billy. 
 There has to be something we can do. 
 Come on, guys, think! 
 Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all? 
 5 ... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power. 
 What?! 
 5 ... They say that somewhere beyond the Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension. 
 How can we get to it? 
 5 As the legend goes, the power is impossible to obtain. 
 We have to try, Alpha.  It's our only hope. 
 5 It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it. 
 If we don't try, Zordon won't survive! 
 If Ivan  Ooze  isn't  stopped, nobody will survive. 
 5 Ay, yi, yi, yi. (beat) The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power. 
 How can we reach Phaedos? 
 5 Zordon's going to have my orbicular spheroids when he hears out about this! 
 5 This is an emergency reserve of morphonic emissions.  It should be enough to get -you there. 
 5 There is one problem.  I only have enough reserve to send you Phaedos...  I can't bring you back. 
 So how do we get back? 
 5 ... You'll have to pray that the legends are true. 
 5 You're sure you want to do this?! The Rangers share purposeful looks. 
 It's our only hope. 
 Safe journey, Rangers! 
  5 BE CAREFUL!! 
 5 Ay, yi, yi, yi.  They're DOOMED!! 
 According to the TX Tracker, they're headed for Phaedos. 
 I'm gonna fire that slimeball so fast his not gonna know what hit him! 
 Hi, honey, I'm home ! 
 You garlic-sucking DINGLEBRAIN! The Rangers are going after the Great Power (to  Zedd) I thought you said this guy was the Master of Disaster? (to  Ivan) He's nothing but a slime- infested, jelly-bellied blob of -- 
 Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!! 
 How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me! 
 Sorry, slick, there's been a slight'change of plans. (arms out in trademark stance) The "booger man" is taking over. 
 Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives! 
 Zedd's gonna kick this snotball into next week! 
 Ooooh, that tickles! 
 My turn. 
 This is all your fault!  If you'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would've happened. 
 Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs. 
 We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place. 
 Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention... 
 Ah yes, the RANGERS!!! 
 Gasunteidt. 
 SHUT YOUR BEAKS !! 
 Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, find the Power Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART! 
 Mordant, go with them and report back to me! 
 You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave-- 
 
!!! 
 Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens! 
 From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions! 
 Watch the HAIRRRRRRRR!! 
. 
 Everybody okay? 
 5 Ay, yi, yi, yi!  The filamentary transistors have malfunctioned! 
  5 Why you low-frequency, battery operated -- 
!!! 
 BILLY!! 
 Welcome to beautiful downtown Phaedos. 
 ... Incredible... 
 Let's see if we can find this Master warrior. 
 Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer. 
 You want me to place a few calls? 
 No need.   I'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove. 
 No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting. 
 Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. (beat) Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?! 
 But boss, what about their parents? 
 Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire. 
 I understand you're looking for a few new assistants. 
 Well put your mind to rest `cause now you've got the best. 
 What is this?!  I advertised for brilliant and good looking assistants! 
 Hi, I'm brilliant. 
 And I'm Little-Bo-Peep. 
 Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over? 
 A stellar idea, Skull. 
 Not so fast, greaseballs. 
 You'll have to do. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 You know, meeting Zordon... teaming up with you guys, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. 
 It's the best thing that's ever happened to all of us. 
 ... He's gonna make it, guys. 
 We'll get this warrior...  save Zordon...  and send that SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the SEWER he crawled out of. 
 
! 
 WE NEED OUR POWERS!! 
 WHAM!  KAPOW!  BOOM! 
 #0!@!#! 
 HANG ON, KIMBERLY. 
 What's the matter with you woodpeckers!  Take this guy out! 
 The Tengu Warriors my butt!  The Tengu TURKEYS is more like it! 
 Hey, aren't you bird-brains forgetting something?! 
 Watch the meathooks!! 
 You're trespassing. (beat) Now state your business. 
 We're looking for the Master Warrior.  Do you know where we can find him? 
 The Master Warrior doesn't entertain visitors  - 
 Zordon? 
 How did this happen?! 
 Huh ... Oh, uh, we re, ah... 
 Ivan Ooze is free?!  We are all in mortal danger! 
 Let' s go. 
 Kind of bossy, isn't she? 
 Boys and girls, girls and boys, gather round and feast your eyes. This ain't sludge and this ain't guck... this is the one and only Ivan's Ooze!  Yesireebob.  It's ooey, gooey and even kind of chewy.  But best of all it's FREE! 
 Here you go!  No pushing! 
 There's enough for everybody! 
 Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information. 
 If we told you -- we'd have to kill you. 
 INCOMING! 
 Come on, come all -- it's an COZE FREE FOR ALL! 
 Is this... food! 
 They're called squirbs. 
 Add a few dried weevils and you'll never know the difference. 
. 
 Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time. 
 What do you know of the Great Power? 
 It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible. 
 In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies. (ominous) For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished. 
 So how can we get to it? 
 The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being... 
 And how do we do that? 
 By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja. (beat) It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit. 
 Look, Zordon doesn't have much longer to live.  And for all we know, Angel Grove could already be under attack.  We don't have TIME for this. 
 You don't understand.  If you do not have the Ninjetti, the power will destroy  you. (beat) To reach the Monolith we must traverse the Neola jungle.  We will train today, and set out on foot tomorrow. 
 HNUGLHLU PHUNGLUMP BUGHLSMRPH 
!!! 
 Snoggle, you watch your language! 
 Slnughyu buglhugrmrph? 
 Excuse me? 
 Slnughyu buglhugrmrph? 
 He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea. 
 Ah... sure. 
 Ah... thanks. 
. 
 In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one. (beat) Now, put your hands inside the flame. 
 Yeah, right. 
 It will not harm you. 
 Just kidding. 
 Wow.  Sand. 
 Now tell me... what do you see? 
 Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold. 
 Stylin'! 
 I see... an Ape. 
 Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape. 
 Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift. 
 Kimberly, you are the Crane, agile and sublime. 
 That's gotta be a frog. 
 Adam, you are the Frog, quick as lightning. 
 It's... an eagle? 
 Look closer. 
 ... A falcon? 
 Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky. 
 I... am the sole living descendant of the "Nathadians". (beat) Now prepare yourselves for the most intense physical and mental training known to man and animal. 
?! 
 #1 You seen my parents? 
 #2 What's going on?! 
 Ooze, ooze, ooze rules!! 
 The crane maintains it's agility through the perfect harmony of mind, body and spirit. 
 Snoggle, we don't have time for you to show off 
 The ape is strong, but more importantly it is flexible and free. 
 Who is this lady? 
 Here goes! 
 The wolf relies on it's enhanced senses to guide it...  He can hear what we cannot hear, he can smell what we cannot smell. 
. 
 The frog remains still and silent while it assesses its target... then strikes out in the blink of an eye. 
 Show off. 
 The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.  Nothing can uproot it. 
 Girl, you've got to be kidding me. 
 The falcon never struggles with the air, but rather becomes one with it. 
 You can do this.  You can do this.  You can do this... 
 ... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers... 
 5 I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen. 
 ... We must try to communicate with them. 
 5 Perhaps if I could locate a vertical-deflector then I could assemble a holographic-comlink. 
 Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi . 
 Each of you must reach deep within and draw upon your natural instincts...  Only then will you know the way of the Ninjetti. (beat) Rest for a few hours.  We will continue at daybreak. 
 Buhph nghujr. 
 I've never been this sore in my life. 
 Maybe if we had more time. 
 ... I wonder... We've been relying on our Morphin Powers for so long... maybe we've forgotten how to rely on ourselves. 
 We should get some rest. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, Simon says...  STOP! 
 Simon says... stand on one foot! 
 Simon says... 
 Quack like a'duck! 
 It just slipped out. 
 SHUT UP!! 
 You didn't say "Simon says". 
 This is the Iast time I use parents for anything! 
 Let's pick it up here!  I've got a schedule to keep.  In twenty four hours the ooze is gonna hit the fan! 
 Hey, boss! 
 What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky 
 How did you fare? 
 Oh, it couldn't've gone better. The Power Rangers didn't know what hit them . 
 That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river! 
 So they've been destroyed? 
 "Basically". 
 What do you mean "basically"? 
 Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere! 
 Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge. But you should've seen the size of his STICKS 
 Did these sticks make a whistling sound? 
 How'd you know? 
 Dulcea! (beat) That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!! 
 How could you let them get away?! If Dulcea leads them to the Great Power, everything will be ruined! They must be OBLITERATED! 
 What're you talking about?!  It wasn't my fault!  You're the featherbrains that let them get away! 
 I call upon the Powers of Darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold! 
. 
 And now the coup de grace, to lead my tribe to victorious battle! 
 Where does he come up with this stuff? 
 Queen Tengu, lead-your warriors to Phaedos, FEAST YOURSELVES UPON THE POWER RANGERS AND BRING ME 
! 
. 
 BUGHU PHUNGL MURHPUGNU!!! 
 How the heck?!... 
 What's going on?! 
 You have been visited by the animal spirits... they have given you their blessing. 
 
 OOZE!  OOZE!  OOZE!  OOZE! 
 Thank you!  Please!  You're too kind. (sotto voce) Finally. a little appreciation where it's deserved. 
 We love you Ivan! 
 Right back at ya!- (he smiles) Now, WHO MISSES SCHOOL?! 
 NOT US! 
 AND WHO MISSES RULES?! 
 NOT US! 
 AND WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME IN RAISING HELL ACROSS  THE 
?! 
 
 Like we said before, that's classified, top secret... 
 Well, why didn't you say so?! 
 They're at the World Center Construction Site. 
 OOZE  RULES ! 
 Dulcea... how do you and Zordon know each other? 
 We belonged to an interstellar Peace Keeping Force known as the "Order of the Meledan". (beat) Zordon was widely regarded as the finest Commander in the Galaxy. He was a true Legend... If it wasn't for him, the Universe would be a very different place from what it is today. 
 So...  what happened? 
 Over time our enemies were defeated...  I returned to Phaedos, Zordon moved on to continue the struggle elsewhere. (beat) Until you kids showed up, I hadn't heard from him for centuries. 
 He was always an inspiration... 
 This is why I'm taking you to the Nathadian Monolith.  That is why I'm teaching you the Ninjetti. (beat) If Zordon dies... then a piece of all of us dies... and the force of good within the Universe will be dealt an irreparable blow. 
 As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?! 
 How about Major Moron? 
 How about the two of you shut Up and pay attention!! 
 What is THAT! 
 Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric 
! (to parents) KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY. (beat) ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD 
 MR. KELMAN Dig... dig... dig... 
 MR. KELMAN Dig... dig... dig... 
 (O.S.) Gotchya! 
. 
 Just shut your gap! 
 Did I say anything? 
 5 By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates. 
 (with difficulty) ... I just pray we're not too late. 
 5 Let's give it a whirl. 
 Angel Grove Police have been fielding hundreds of calls from concerned citizens as the number of missing gersons continues to grow 
 Hi, folks, Ivan Ooze here. 
 5 Ai,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi 
 Are you bored with your work? Are you bored with your family Are you bored with your 1ife Well, come on down to Ooze City and LET'S GET STICKY! 
 The Monolith is there in the distance. 
 This is as far as I can take you. 
 I have taught you all that I know.   Now you must achieve the Ninjetti on your own. 
 It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it. 
 About twenty seconds in your time. 
 And how do we release the power? 
 The legend goes that you release the power with the power. 
 What does that mean! 
 That is a question that even I cannot answer. (beat) Remember, ten triacs.  After that something bad will happen. 
 They say the power will throw off a super-heated, radioactive fireball, instantly reducing you to ash and bits of charred bone. 
 That's pretty bad. 
 Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything. 
 Ka'Alabas tor nartu En'Kata-Tay. (beat) May your animals watch over you. 
 Finally, after centuries of waiting, my Ecto-Morphicon machines are ready to take on the world! 
 GET THAT THING OUT OF MY FACE! 
 Oh, man, that was a rental! 
 Mordant... let the ooze flow! 
 Goldar... the roof! 
 Looks like a fine day for raising 
! 
 HECALE MENNIPUS LIBRI MAGUS! 
 Bullseye! 
 LIFE!!  Give my creatures LIFE! 
 This guy is the King! 
 PARENTS OF ANGEL GROVE. 
 YOU HAVE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE. NOW YOU WILL RETURN TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE AND LEAP TO 
! 
 What're you waiting for??... 
 What! 
 You forgot to say 'Simon says." 
 Whadda we do now? 
 We can take these guys! 
 
! 
 The frog silently assesses its target, then strikes out... 
 ... in the blink of an eye. 
 Yo, Tweety! 
 The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.  Nothing can uproot it. 
 Bye, bye birdy. 
 It's up to you. 
 Polly wanna cracker? 
 WE DID IT!! 
 ANGEL GROVE... I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A COUPLE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST FRIENDS... 
! 
 And his trimetallic partner in crime... SCORPITRON!! 
 THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!! 
 
!! 
 LONG LIVE THE BOOGER MAN! 
 5 That should do it.  we won't be able to hear them, but they SHOULD be able to hear us. (beat) Here goes. 
 ... the Mayor has declared a state of emergency and asked that the city be immediately evacuated.  He has reiterated the need for everyone to remain calm. 
 Angel Grove has never before known such a crisis and we can now only pray for the swift arrival of the Power Rangers! 
 5 Ay, yi, yi, yi! 
 ... Alpha, keep trying! 
 ... The Nathadian Monolith... 
 We've come all this way for a rock wall?! 
 Release the power with the power. 
 Not that kind of power. 
 It can't end like this... 
 Rangers... Ivan has invaded the city... time is running out... 
 Each of you are now in possession of miraculous skills... but only when the six become one will you have the strength to harness the Great Power. 
!! 
 Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti. 
 Strength in numbers!! 
 I am the bear, stalwart and bold! 
 I am the frog, quick as lightning! 
 I am the mighty ape! 
 And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky! 
 WE... ARE THE NINJETTI!!! 
 What HAPPENED?! 
 Where are we?! 
!! 
 That's twenty seconds!! 
 Release the power WITH the power. 
 What does that mean?! 
 Ten seconds and counting!! 
 Release the power with the power. 
 
!! 
 LET'S DO IT!? 
. 
. 
 WE HAVE THE GREAT POWER!! 
 NEW POWER COINS!! 
. WE DID IT!! 
 HANG ON, ANGEL GROVE. 
 Spherhlegnu. 
 Yes, Snoggle... they now have the Great Power of the Ninjetti! 
 There goes the neighborhood. 
 A real shame. 
 #4 Shut up, squirt. 
 #3 You can't talk that way about our leader. 
! 
 
 We could take it with us. 
 
?! 
 5 Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late. 
 What?! 
 5 Zordon...  he's gone. 
 "To those who possess the Great Power...   all things are possible." 
. 
 
!! 
 Welcome back, kids.

 That's fantastic. See, if we're talking that kind of volume I can absolutely massage the numbers a little. Seriously, you're not gonna be able to keep it on the shelf. 
 Yeah, I'd need to look at some things before I can place an order. 
 How about I give you a call if I decide to-- 
 I'll call you. Not a problem. No problem at all. Even better, I'll swing by. You're on my route. How `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow. 
 Yeah, tomorrow's not good. 
 Thursday then. That's better anyway. That'll give you a chance to take a look see on those other stores. We'll put everything on one order and get you a good price break. 
 My advice to you - weed out some of this weaker product to make more space for the corn. Like this... 
 Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright idea was it to stock that? I mean come on, what self respecting kid asks his mom for apricot fruit leather?

 Gonna lose some inventory. 
 Selfish bastard. 
 Trust me, you do not want some lady suing you cuz she found this guy's tooth in her brand new fanny pack. 
 Yep, a real pain in the ass. 
 We're wrapping it up. 
 Three grand just to have the asshole wiped up off the floor. Can you believe that? 
 Hey, can you handle the report tonight? I gotta thing I gotta do. 
 A blonde thing or a brunette thing?

 The fact that we have sex, real coitus sex, means I'm under no obligation to blow you. 
 I think you're scared of it. 
 (Holding in the smoke) I'm not scared of it. 
 Uncomfortable then. You just need to get better acquainted.

 There's absolutely no pressure here.

 You're welcome. 
 (Rhythmically) Yeah... baby... I want... Oh... 
 He's slowly freezing to death and he knows lobsterman is out there... somewhere... coming for him. And he's totally screwed because his tongue is stuck to the mailbox. 
 Why did he lick the mailbox? 
 I don't know. Maybe he had OCD and he was obsessed with licking mailboxes. 
 Why wasn't he in school?

 Are you gonna let me tell the story? 
 An then, he hears a horrible sound. Snap, snap, drag. Snap, snap, drag. Lobsterman is coming. 
 Maybe he didn't go to school because he had the ACD. 
 Sorry. 
 He's trapped. If he doesn't rip the skin off his tongue and make a run for it lobsterman will tear him to pieces with his razor sharp claws. 
 You should hear the way he goes on about his lean body mass index bullshit. Drinking that antioxidant, protein powder, enzyme crap all the time.

 He needed to be brought down a peg or two. 
 I should introduce him to your sister. 
 We were working a scene today where this guy offs himself in a sporting goods store. So they had this cleaning crew out there, right? You would not believe how much money they charge for that shit. It's ridiculous. 
 Naw, the body's gone, it's just the blood and stuff. 
 You ask me it's a racket. You should get into that.

 You know that's not what I think.

 It's about time. I thought your class got over at 9:30.

 Nothing. 
 It was just Mr. Kim being a dick head. 
 Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started working there. Now he's a full on gym teacher, I swear to God. 
 Oh please, you love it when I fuck up. Love it. Me screwing up gives you the hugest woody.

 Completely pie free.

 Thanks. We're expecting our second in a couple of months. 
 How are you? You look just the same. 
 God, I always envied you so much. Head cheerleader... dating the quarterback... So did you and Mac end up getting married? 
 Wow. Well it's so good to see you. Let me get your info so I can send you an invite to the baby shower. 
 It'll be like a big reunion. The whole gang from high school will be there. 
 So what are you doing now?

 It's not just this incident. There have been several episodes over the past year where Oscar has... has engaged in disruptive behavior. 
 There was the incident in gym class. 
 And the chalk thing. 
 And the time he locked Jeremy Johnston in the-- 
 Now it's... licking.

 I will not tolerate it. I will not tolerate that behavior in my classroom. 
 Oscar has started licking things in the classroom. 
 First it was the pencil sharpener. Then the aquarium. 
 (O.S.) It's unsanitary. And it's disturbing to the other children. 
 We think Oscar might benefit from an environment where he could receive more specialized attention. 
 He licked my leg. 
 3/5/07     18-19. 
 Where'd you get those? 
 Up there. 
 Come here. 
 Those were your grandma's. She'd watch birds with those. 
 Hey, hey. Careful. 
 Why don't we put those away.

 Why can't I play with them? 
 Because it's not a toy. It's a scientific instrument. 
 You can play with them when I'm around to supervise. 
 You're around now. 
 I'm tired now. 
 Rose, you buy generic cigarettes with couch change. How are you gonna pay for private school?

 The kid's a little strange. What? That's against the law now? It's not like he's out killing kittens or any damn thing. I swear everyone's so damn uptight these days. 
 Hello.

 I want to have my birthday at Hinkle's. 
 The hell with Hinkle's, I'm taking us to Disney Land! 
 Why? I think Disney Land is a great idea! 
 Yeah, what's wrong with Disney Land? And I think it'd be great if you girls worked together. 
 You are so out of touch. 
 Some sorta domestic disturbance kind of a deal. It was the lady who got the last word I guess. Course she's in jail now, so... Heard one bullet completely shot off his ring finger. How long you gals been doin' this kind a work?

 I'm not selling my house. No way. I don't care how much those idiots would shell out for it. I got history in that house. You think they understand about history? 
 Hey, the corn's good. Really good. Not like the pet food but that was a phenomenon. 
 It'll get there. Takes time to get to know the market. Develop a relationship with the buyers. But it'll get there. Who doesn't like popcorn for Christ's sake.

 What'd he do with the brains and intestines? 
 So he cuts out the middle man. Not a bad idea. 
 Course it'd be smarter to do that with something that didn't have bad parts. Like... shrimp.

 Corn. 
 Exactly. Corn. Can you think of anything more wholesome? It's all American for Christ's sake. 
 Do you know if they sell fancy corn here? 
 Do you even know what fancy corn is? 
 Yes. 
 Well, do they sell it here? 
 I dunno. 
 I heard that the strawberry fancy corn gives you bionic strength. 
 That's stupid. 
 It's true. Some kind of chemical in the strawberry flavoring. If you eat a whole lot of it, it gives you bionic strength. 
 I don't believe you. 
 I don't care if you do or not.

 I read where these chemicals are getting into the streams, making hermaphrodidic frogs! You think mothers want to expose their kids to that stuff? No way. More and more people are looking for healthy alternatives which is why the demand for this product is so huge right now.

 I wonder how she died? 
 That was real good. You're a natural. You got the timing, you got the nerve. You're a real sharp cookie, you know that? 
 No I'm not. I'm stupid.

 Don't say that. 
 What? 
 It's those teachers who are retarded. You're probably just too advanced for those classes. You're bored. Do you get bored in class? 
 Yeah. 
 See. You're too smart! And those teachers just don't know how to handle you. You're probably a goddamn genius. 
 You think so? 
 I know so!

 Hobby... 
 There's this gorilla who knows sign language and I've always thought that would have to be the most amazing thing ever. You know? To actually talk to a gorilla. 
 I think I've seen something on-- 
 KoKo. 
 Yeah, yeah, with the kitten. 
 Kitten died. It wasn't KoKo's fault. She was heartbroken. 
 Kind of weird, don't you think? Teaching a gorilla to talk. Probably, gorillas aren't supposed to talk. 
 That's what's so cool about it. 
 I'm sorry again about the... 
 No, don't... it's fine.

 You're back early. 
 What are you talking about? You can't quit real estate. You're gonna be great at real estate. You got the whole look and besides, that's where everything's headed. Hell, it's what I should have done forty years ago. 
 Want me to make you something happy? 
 Make me something happy too.

 That's a nice job you did there. 
 Where's your arm? 
 That's all right. 
 Yeah sure. 
 This is great but you guys should really get out there and market yourselves. 
 Funeral Homes, property managers... What you really want is to get in with the insurance companies. They can throw you a ton of work.

 Do you guys have your B.B.P. certification? 
 Blood Born Pathogens. The big money jobs... they'll expect you to be certified. I can register you for the next seminar if you want. 
 Not exactly. 
 (Quietly to Rose) Now Sherm's gonna say he's against the wall but don't you believe him. There's always some wiggle room. 
 I think you're gonna like this Econoline.

 What's the play on that? 
 Oh, that's the floor right there. I'm actually taking a loss on this to make room for some new product. 
 Cash is good.

 Character. 
 We were over at Motor Mart on Lomas earlier. They got a nice looking Chevy G series for eighteen. 
 Power steering? 
 What's that? 
 Oh, excellent. 
 What is it? 
 It's a CB. You talk into this thing and hold this thing down and it turns your voice into radio waves and sends it into the heavens. 
 Heaven?

 Ahh! Lick around the base. Secure the perimeter. (To Rose) Don't you teach this kid anything? 
 (O.S.) It's the gorilla girl. 
 You never came to donate.

 Okay. Well, see you around. 
 You still selling that luggage? 
 No, no. That was a whole big mess. 
 Crappy zippers. Wasn't that it? 
 Yeah, that's been a while now. Dropped the luggage around the time your other lot when out of business. 
 I could maybe drop it to nineteen even. 
 And toss in some wiper fluid.

 (smiles) I'm glad to see you're doing a little homework. A lot of people, you know, they think they can just jump in to this, make lots of money. But, they don't know what they're doing. No idea. They're not professional and that makes us all look bad. 
 You're not certified? 
 You had a... 
 Sure I can't buy you a drink? 
 If you spray the enzyme at that point it'll just turn back to liquid which is a pain in the ass. The key is to bag it when it's kind of Jell-o-ee.

 What's a bastard? 
 Jeremy said I was a bastard. What does that mean? 
 It just means your mom wasn't married when she had you. It's no big deal. In a couple of years you're gonna find it's a free pass to cool. You'll probably start a band called Bastard Son. Use it to impress the chicks. Trust me, the whole bastard thing... it's working for you.

 I won a million dollars! 
 Let me see that. 
 You gotta get two hydrants with a matching amount. See? None of your fire hydrants match. 
 And three zeros is a thousand dollars. You woulda won a thousand dollars but it doesn't match anything. 
 What happens if it doesn't match anything? 
 You toss it and try the next one. 
 I think I won five hundred dollars.

 And we're not going to spend the money. We're going to invest the money. 
 See, that's the difference between a regular person and somebody with business acumen. That's a good word for you to know. A-cu-men. Means smarts. 
 (into the receiver) Bobby! Joe Lorkowski here. (laughs) I told you I'd call. (pause) Yeah well, I got the money and we're in. But you gotta throw in twenty bags of ice. 
 We're gonna make the money grow because that's the smart way. It's capital and you don't spend that. You invest it. That way you can get the SP250 and have money left over.

 I'm not Mormon. I just... You're gonna think it's weird. 
 What? 
 Sometimes I think that when you get high or drink or alter your consciousness like that-- 
 You don't drink? 
 I think it weakens you psychically... like it creates these cracks and then bad things can seep in and maybe never go away. 
 All right, you're kind of freakin me out. 
 Sorry.

 What was I before I was born? What happens when we die? Do animals go to the same place as we go after we die? Is heaven really crowded? When somebody gets an arm chopped off does it go to heaven?

 (over phone) Hello, this is Henry Schmidt at State Farm. 
 (over phone) I spoke with you about a month ago. 
 (over phone) We've got a house we need to turn around and our regular guys are busy in Santa Fe today. Thought I'd give you all a call. 
 It's busy.

 Blow off the shower. 
 So tell him we can't do it. 
 So, don't go to the damn baby shower. It's not like you ever even liked Paula.

 Pee-ew. 
 Why do I--

 I'm busy here. 
 Those snotty restaurant fucks wouldn't buy my shrimp. Some bullshit about health codes or whatever. I don't believe that shit for a second. 
 3/5/07        87. 136   CONTINUED:                                                          136 
 Don't. Don't start with me. (Pause) Bastards completely shut me out. They got their own little cartel. Little restaurant mafia. I bet they screwed with my car too. I wouldn't put it past `em. Bunch of shady mother fuckers. 
 I can't. 
 I can't watch Oscar today Rose. 
 Yeah, well it's hard, isn't it? Raising a kid on your own. Try two. 
 You look nice. 
 3/5/07       87A. 138   CONTINUED:                                                       138

 I guess not. 
 You did your hair different. 
 What's that? 
 This is a World War Two Mitchell Cannon Nose Bomber. 
 You make all these models?

 Dab the end of that in the glue. Just a little bit. 
 What's that piece for? 
 It's a strut. 
 What's a strut? 
 Supports the wing. 
 Seems like it'd be hard to build models with just one hand. 
 It is.

 So Rose, what are you doing? Are you still cleaning houses? 
 Rose has gone into real estate. 
 Really? 
 A real estate business? 
 What does that mean ­ biohazard removal whatever?

 Oh my God. 
 I can't imagine. You like doing it? 
 Sounds horrible to me. 
 I believe I'd vomit.

 Shit. 
 Oh my God, you're the cutest thing ever. Did you get left behind? 
 It's okay. 
 No, no, no.

 It was an accident.

 Jesus Rose, Calm down. 
 Well, if you had been here to help me but no, you're off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don't even matter. Prove to your old cheerleading squad that you're not this huge loser. If you had been here doing your job it wouldn't have happened. So don't try to put all this on me. 
 Oh, go ahead and play the martyr. It's like your favorite thing. 
 I am   so sick of all your holier than   thou bullshit. Why don't you take   a look at you're own life, huh?   You're a real inspiration.

 Long baby shower. 
 Oscar's asleep in back.

 Yeah. 
 Carl told me. 
 Insurance? 
 Didn't you go to that?

 Cheering is good. 
 3/5/07        99. 
 (O.S.) Rose? 
 Hey beautiful. 
 I was starting to think you were on a date or something. 
 You okay? 
 Can I come in? 
 I got you something. 
 It's for your business cards. You put `em in there and, I don't know... impress people.

 You don't like it? 
 Come on, let's not do that. 
 So that's it? 
 That's it then. 
 No.

 I need to talk to Lynn. 
 She can't donate. You can't donate. 
 Forty-eight days. It's not been forty-eight days. 
 Why are you acting like this? Why haven't you called me back. 
 Listen, I just, don't think you're the kind of person I need to be hanging out with right now. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Do I really need to spell it out? 
 Here.

 3/5/07       102. 
 I'm sure I can turn this stuff around pretty quick. 
 Are you coming to my party? 
 Sounds like a blast. 
 That other pair we looked at, full of gadgets and gimmicks. (MORE)

 These here are the real deal. I want you to have them. 
 No Rose, I want to him to have these. 
 Wow, is that an old Zeiss? 
 Porro prism? 
 Eight by thirty Jenoptems. No marks on the objectives. Perfect bloom. 
 You got yourself some classic binoculars there. 
 Sorry I'm late.

 Where are you going? 
 Winston cleans up pretty good.

 I read somewhere that beauty is really all about symmetry. Like having eyes the same size and all that. (pause) So, you know, when you factor that in he's like, hot. 
 Listen, I know I fucked up, okay? Like really huge and I know that and I'm sorry, okay? 
 I really am sorry. But it really isn't all my fault, Rose. 
 3/5/07      104A. 163   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 163

 What are you going to do now? 
 I've got my own ideas. 
 Winston? No. 
 You gonna open my present? 
 Cool. 
 The guy said that if you're careful they'll last a whole month. And these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns and shit. They're all based on classic biker designs.

 Cool. 
 Li'l bastard. 
 I'm thinking of taking a road trip. 
 Where? 
 Haven't worked it all out yet. I was thinking I could maybe take the van. 
 Don't sell the van. 
 No, listen... just don't sell the van. 
 3/5/07       107. 164   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   164 
 Just don't sell the van yet. Okay? 
 Rose tells me you make models. 
 Yeah. 
 Any money in that? 
 Not really. 
 What?

 What's good? 
 3/5/07       109. 
 There's something I wanted to talk to you about. 
 Well, I was wondering if I could move in with you and Oscar. 
 Just temporarily - until I find a place. 
 I didn't lose the house. I sold the house. There's this business opportunity--

 It's not just some get rich quick scheme. And I got a partner who has experience. I'd learn from her. 
 Don't make a big deal out of it. 
 It's a business lie, not a real lie. 
 And you'd be the boss.

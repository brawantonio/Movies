# 2 (trembling) We cool. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Claireece ... 
 MR. WICHER (forcing a smile) Of course Precious. Thank you. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Are you pregnant? You're sixteen, still in junior high school and pregnant with your second child. Correct Claireece? Claireece are you pregnant again? 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Do you have any thoughts about your situation? 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Claireece? 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN (beat) Claireece, I'm talking to you. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Claireece?! 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN What? 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN ...No. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN (firmly) Sit down Claireece. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN (beat) You know what I think? I think we should have a parent-teacher conference - me, you and your mom. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Well maybe I could arrange to come to your house. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Well then Claireece, I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN You're pregnant. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Your attitude is one of total uncooperation and that won't help a thing... 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Now according to our records, your mother also looks after the child. Is that correct? 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Are you in contact with the father? (beat) Is he at all involved in your child's care? 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Fine! If that's the way you wanna play it, we can do this all day. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN 
 SECURITY! SECURITY! 
 (O.S) You get my cigarettes? 
! 
 (O.S.) (at the top of her lungs) I SAID I'M HONGRY YOU FAT LITTLE PIGGY CUNT BITCH!!! Git your Jezebel ass up and git to dinner 'fore I give you something to cry about. 
 ...I ain' gon' say it again. 
 Tell them assholes to stop ringing my bell. 
! 
! 
 Press LISTEN stupid. 
 (O.S.) It's Sondra Lichenstein for Claireece and Ms. Mary Johnston. 
 Who that Precious? 
 What she want? 
 Ask her stupid. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN (O.S.) I want to talk to you about your education. 
 Eighty-six that bitch. 
! 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN (O.S.) Claireece I am so sorry about today. I only want to help you. I ...Mr. Wicher says you're one of his best students and that you have an aptitude for math -or at least potential. (beat) I've called a Mrs. McKnight at Higher Education Alternative / Each One Teach One. It's an alternative school. (beat) Claireece, are you listening? 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN (O.S.) Claireece, did you hear me? 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN (O.S.) I've called Ms. McKnight at Each One Teach One. It's located on the nineteenth floor of the Hotel Theresa on 125th Street. That's not too far from here. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN (O.S.) The phone number is 555-0831. I told them about you. Call or drop in, nineteenth floor. 
 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Listen Claireece... If you go down tomorrow.... Look, they have just started their semester. You may be a day or 2 late... Give it a try. 
 School can't help none. Go down welfare. Who she think she is? 
 Where you going? 
 You hear me talking to you?! 
 Precious when we gon' play? 
 You said we was gon' play. 
 Why not? 
 So?! I ain' the only one. 
 ...nuffin. 
 I check in wif you tomorrow Precious. 
 BOY'S VOICE Watch where you goin' Orca! 
 Why do you say that shit when you don't mean it Trey? I'm not playing with you and I know that wasn't your damn sister neither....because you don't have one...Fine. Yeah, whatever. 
 (looking up) The what? 
 What exactly are you looking for? 
 This is Higher Education Alternative / Each One Teach One. 
 This is an alternative school. 
 What are you asking me? 
 Each One Teach One is an alternative school and an alternative school is like a choice, a different way to do something. 
 You need your discharge papers from your old school saying they have formally discharged you or we can't allow you in the program. 
 You still need formal discharge papers or we can't let you in. It's the law. 
 Oh you're the one Mrs. Lichenstein called about. 
 (searching papers) Are you Claireece P. Jones? 
 Well the principal at I.S. 111 already sent your discharge papers and stuff over. 
 Your academic record. 
 Are you all right? 
 Claireece? 
 We had to have certain information before we could accept you into the program. So really, their sending your records over was just a way of speeding things up for you. 
 Yup. The only other thing we need right now is income verification. Are you currently receiving AFDC? 
 Oh, you've had amniocentesis? 
 You said your mother has custody of you and your daughter? 
 Oh I see. Your mother has custody of you and your daughter so you're on her budget. 
 Okay, well I need a copy of your mother's budget and a current phone or utilities bill, okay? 
 No, relax. We're just gonna give you a few tests -test your reading and math level, see where to place you. 
 Well, to enter G.E.D. classes a student should be able to read on an eighth-grade level. They should score 8.0 or better on the TABE reading test. 
 (smiling) Then you should have no problem. 
! 
 # 1 (O.S.) ...What that on your dress Precious? 
 # 2 (O.S.) She don't say nuffin'. She don't talk to nobody. 
 # 1 (O.S.) She nasty. 
 # 3 (O.S.) When the last time yo head was combed? 
 # 4 (O.S.) ...What?! Shut up Precious. You talk funny. You was better when you was on mute. 
 Here come the wide load... 
. 
 # 5 (O.S.) Teacher! Teacher! Precious peeded herself again! 
 (O.S.) Claireece, do you need another pencil? 
 Claireece ... 
 Are you finished? 
 PRECIOUS (V.O. CONT.) ...The tesses paint a picture of me wif no brain. The tesses paint a picture of me 'an my muver -my whole family as less than dumb just ugly black grease to be wiped away, punished, caged up, kilt, changed, finded a job for. 
! !! 
! !! 
 (0. S. ) What?! 
 (0. S. ) For what? 
 (0. S. ) (beat) How much you need? 
 (O.S.) (beat) Come and git it then. 
 (O.S.) Where you going?!

 MS. RAIN Okay Claireece. 
 PRECIOUS (V.O. CONT'D) ...then I think, never that again. 
 MS. RAIN (beat) Something you do well? 
 MS. RAIN (softly) Everybody is good at something. 
 MS. RAIN One thing? 
 MS. RAIN And? 
 MS. RAIN (beat) How does it make you feel? 
 MS. RAIN (V.O.) The longest journey begins with a single step... 
 MS. RAIN We're all in this together Rita. Class? 
 MS. RAIN This is just the beginning. Why don't we try by ourselves? There are 26 letters in the alphabet. They all have a sound. These letters make up all the words in our language. Please open your notebooks, write the date and then let's write the alphabet. 
 MS. RAIN (O.S.) This is going to be painless ... 
 MS. RAIN ...I just want you to read a page from this book. 
 MS. RAIN Precious? 
 MS. RAIN C'mon Precious. Give it a try. 
 MS. RAIN Precious. Honey are you okay? Try to relax. Should I call an ambulance? 911? Your moth ... 
 MS. RAIN What is it? 
 MS. RAIN (beat) The words or the pictures? 
 MS. RAIN I think I understand you Precious but I still want you to try. You're going to have to push yourself. 
 MS. RAIN What do you think the story is about? 
 MS. RAIN That's right. 
 MS. RAIN Do you know what that is? 
 MS. RAIN Do you know that word? 
 MS. RAIN Do you know the letters. 
 MS. RAIN Do you know that word? 
 MS. RAIN Day. That word is day. 
 MS. RAIN What's that word? 
 MS. RAIN Good! Almost! The word is 'at'. 
 MS.   RAIN 'Shore'. That   word is 'shore'. That's almost   like 'beach'. Very good. Can you   read the whole thing? 
 Bring your fat ass in here! 
 Where you sneak your ass off to this morning? 
 You hear me talking to you! Where you sneak your ass off to this morning?! 
 You lying whore! 
 You is! The welfare done called here, saying they is removing you from my budget 'cause you not in regular attendance in school. 
 You didn't say nothin' `bout no damn school today. 
 I ain' had no breakfast. 
 ...Need to forget school. Need to git your ass on down to welfare. 
 Fool fuck a stipend. What's that? I said take your ass down to welfare. 
 No stupid. Got to be there at 7 in the A.M. if you gonna talk to anybody... 
 -Oh you too good for that? Is that what you is now, too good for welfare? (beat) 
 Now hurry yo ass up. I'm gon die of starvation over here. Then where you be at then? 
 What you gon' have? 
 Yes you is. 
 Sit your ass down. 
 Jus make mine after you done. This gon' get cold if it sit. 
 Do what I say don't say what I say. Now eat bitch! 
 ...Best feed like a pig and not a cow so's you can git yo ass back to the stove. If I croak off starvation, where in the world you be at then? 
 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) ...Claireece, would you like to talk about your home life? 
 MS. WEISS Whatever comes to mind when you think about your home. 
 MS. WEISS (beat) Is that all? 
 MS. WEISS Of course. I want to learn more about your father anyway. 
 MS. WEISS Weiss. 
 MS. WEISS (quickly) What did you say your father gave you? 
 MS. WEISS Yes you did Claireece. You said your father gave you... 
 MS. WEISS Um...How about your first child? You haven't spoken much about her... 
 MS. WEISS (O.S.) Excuse me? 
 MS. WEISS (O.S.) You mean she has Down Syndrome? 
 MS. WEISS How do you respond to them? 
 
 That hurt girl. 
 (leaving) Maybe I will. 
 Alright. 
 MS. RAIN (V. O. ) Dear Precious, I am glad you love your baby. 
 MS. RAIN (V.O.) I think a beautiful young girl like you should have a chance to get an education. I think your first responsibility has to be to yourself. You should not drop out of school ... 
 PRECIOUS (V.O. CONT'D ) Social worker ask me if I want to give Little Mongo and Abdul up for adoption. I could kill her. She never help before. Now she want to take my kids away? If she take Abdul, I won't have nothing nomore. 
 MS. RAIN (V.O.) Dear Precious, It seems the opposite to me. If you keep Abdul you might have nothing. You are learning to read and write, that is everything. Come back to school when you get out of the hospital. You're only seventeen. Your whole life is in front of you. 
 MS. RAIN (V.O.) Dear Precious, You are not a dog. You are a wonderful young woman who is trying to make something of her life. I have some questions for you. 1. Where was your grandmother when your father was abusing you? 2. Where is Little Mongo now? 3. What is going to be the best thing for you in this situation? 
 MS. RAIN (V.O.) Dear Dear Precious, Being a good mother might mean letting your baby be raised by someone who is better able than you to meet the child's needs. 
 MS. RAIN (V.O.) Dear Precious, When you are raising a small infant you need help. Who is going to help you? How will you support yourself? How will you keep learning to read and write? 
 MS. RAIN (V.O.) Dear Precious Miss, When you get home from the hospital, look and see how much welfare has helped your mother. 
 MS. RAIN (V.O.) You could go further than your mother. You could get your G.E.D. and go to college. You could do anything Precious but you have to believe it. Love, Blu Rain. 
 Hi Precious. You back? That your new baby? What it's name? Can I hold it? ..Precious? 
 Bitch!!! 
! ! ! 
! ! ! 
 (O.S.) YOU RUIN MY LIFE YOU FAT LITTLE 
!!! 
 FIRST YOU STEAL MY HUSBAND, THEN YOU GET ME CUT OFF THE WELFARE YOU STUPID-MOUTH BITCH! 
 YOU IS! YOU IS TOO! YOU IS AND YOU ALWAYS GON BE NUTHIN BUT STUPID TIL THE DAY YOU DIE! YOU HEAR ME?!! STUPID!!! 
 (O.S.) Mary, leave that chile alone. Stop beating that girl Mary. 
 I'M GON KILL YOU PIG! 
 (O.S.) YOU HEAR ME PRECIOUS! GET YOUR BIG, BLACK ASS BACK IN HERE! 
 Precious what happened? 
 Precious, could I see your baby now? I just wanna see. 
 Precious, what's wro... 
 He's on break. He'll be back soon. Have a seat. 
 Hey...You don't remember me do you? 
 I delivered your last one. 
 You know I'm sorry to see you back here. (beat) I remembered hoping that you would have learned from your mistakes. 
 What happened? 
 (murmuring) ...Put your bags in bed with you. Put your bags in the bed with you. Put 'em in. Tuck 'em in bed with you... 
 Give the chile back her blanket! 
 Fuck you. I ain' giving back shit. 
    C D E F G H I J K L M N 0 P, Q 
    T U V, W X Y Z. (singing softly) Now   I know my ABC's, tell me what you   think of me. 
 MS. RAIN (sternly) Yes I'll hold. (grumbling while on hold) Safety net huh? What damn safety net?! A newborn child! A NEW BORN! In this fucking day and... 
 MS. RAIN Excuse my language Precious. 
 Hi Precious! 
 What happened? 
 MS. RAIN Good morning girls. Tell the others to start writing when they come in. Whichever one of you is older is in charge until I get back. And Consuelo, I know that is not you. So here is $20.00. 
 MS. RAIN Go get something for Precious to wear. Quick! And bring me back my change. 
 How old you is? 
 Same age as you. 
 When your birthday? 
 When yours? 
 I asked you first. 
 So ... 
 MS. RAIN Well why didn't you tell me that before!!! I'm sitting here half the- 
 MS. RAIN Before this day is up, you will have a place to live Precious. 
 (looking at her watch) Jo Ann, you late. 
 You ain't the teacher. 
 I am today. Miz Rain busy wif Precious. 
 (thrilled) Alright!!! (concerned) How Precious? 
 MS. RAIN Yeah. Queens ...What do you think? 
 MS. RAIN Me either. You should stay in Harlem...long as we can anyway. 
 MS. RAIN I have this West Indian friend whose boyfriend is a council member. (with uncertainty) We'll see what they can do... 
 MS. RAIN ...C-L-A-I-R-E-E ... 
 WOMAN'S VOICE Hey Precious. 
 (still moving) How you been? 
 I don't know... I went to see that movie Barfly last night... That piece of shit was depressin...Cute kid. 
 MS. RAIN I have the information on my desk. Can you hold one second? 
 MS. RAIN (to   Suzanne) I think   I may be onto something. (to   Precious) Come on   Precious. 
 How do you spell "Aquarius"? 
 What you want to spell that for? 
 A-Q-U-A-R-I-U-S. 
 Is that right? 
 Of course it's right. I'm one of `em. 
 I wonder can you spell "boy" then. 
 I wonder can you spell "slut" then. 
 Maybe, but I bet Miss Lisa can. 
 MS. RAIN Yes Brenda. Thank you. 
 MS. RAIN They can take you. Tomorrow...at a place here in Harlem. 
 MS. RAIN You just need somewhere to stay tonight. (beat) You don't snore do you? 
 Honey, how many times did I tell you about the music? 
 (warmly) You must be Precious. Hi. 
 MS. RAIN Precious, this is my wife Katherine. 
 MS. RAIN I said that this is my wife Katherine. 
 (smiling at Abdul) What's his name? He's adorable. 
 He looks just like you. 
 MS. RAIN Yes Precious. Very much. 
 ...Ask yourself. Just ask yourself; if Ronald McDonald were running the show and the price of hamburgers skyrocketed, wouldn't you be suspicious? 
 MS. RAIN I just think you should finish the book. 
 Who's gonna read it? 
 MS. RAIN Nobody if you don't write it. Precious writes everyday. You should try it. 
 What do you write about Precious? 
 MS. RAIN Katherine was just drawing a comparison so that her point could be more easily understood... 
 MS. RAIN You okay Precious? 
! 
 You're welcome. What are you gonna do with your award money? 
 You know Blu? 
 Yeah. 
 Well she has, has she uh...got a man? 
 Well I was hoping you could put in the good word. 
 Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say. 
 (on the phone noticing Precious) Hold on girl. 
 Hi ...How are you? 
 I get off at 4. 
 MS. RAIN Precious, I thought you went home. 
 MS. RAIN You're welcome. It was my pleasure. 
 MS. RAIN Was there something else? 
 MS. RAIN (beat) Are you sure? 
 MS. RAIN Yes? 
 MS. RAIN Mm hm... 
 MS. RAIN Everybody has those Precious. 
 MS. RAIN It only looks that way. Yes, I talk to people all the time for support. 
 MS. RAIN What on earth are you talking about? 
 MS. RAIN What?! 
 MS. RAIN You just what?! 
 MS. RAIN Precious?! 
 MS. RAIN You've helped me already. 
 MS. RAIN Last night I had a conversation with my mother, and that never happens cause our relationship is.... complicated. We don't speak, and when we do, it always ends in a fight about my filthy misguided existence. Most times I feel terrible for days afterwards wondering whether all the hateful things she said are true. Those days I just feel like...like... 
 MS. RAIN ...Yeah. I didn't feel so bad this time though. (beat) Cause this time I thought about how strong you've had to be and then I decided that I had nothing to be ashamed of and that my mother was wrong about me, my dad and 5 or 6 hundred other things. You ask if you can help me? Baby, you already have. 
 MS. RAIN That's the for real, hope to die if I'm lying truth. Now shouldn't you be out the door? 
 MS. RAIN (standing) Suit yourself. 
 Precious ...you have a visitor. 
 It's not Rhonda. 
 Your daddy dead. 
 No. (beat) Carl ...Carl had that AIDS virus. 
 Got what? 
 No. 
 We never did, you know... 
 We never did what you got to do to get it. 
 Yeah...but not like faggots, in the ass and all, so I know. 
 You welcome back home. 
 MS. RAIN Rita, what do I mean when the author describes her protagonist's circumstances as "unrelenting"? 
 I don't know Miz Rain. 
 MS. RAIN C'mon Rita, think about the question before you just give up like that... 
 MS. RAIN Precious? 
 MS. RAIN Precious? 
 MS. RAIN Precious, bring your journal to me. 
 MS. RAIN Precious, would you come to my office for a moment? 
 MS. RAIN Preci- 
 Your baby okay? 
 MS. RAIN (to Precious) One time in your journal you told me that you had never really told your story. (softly) write. 
 MS. RAIN I think telling your story will get you over that river Precious ... 
 MS. RAIN Open your notebook Precious. 
 MS. RAIN I know you are but you can't stop now. You gotta fight through this. You still have to live your life and do the best you can with the hand you've been dealt. If not for yourself then for the people who love you. 
 MS. RAIN People do love you Precious. 
 MS. RAIN That wasn't love. There are people in this room who love you. Your child loves you too. Is that clear Precious? Now if Rita decided to just give up? Would you let her? 
 MS. RAIN Would you?! 
 MS. RAIN And why not?! 
 MS. RAIN Because you love her...as much as she loves you. 
 MS. RAIN Now the rest of the world can judge you, cheat you, beat you, dismiss you and abandon you all it wants but we won't let you give up and that's the only thing that matters. Some people have less than that on their side and still manage to keep going. (beat) It's up to you. 
 MS. WEISS ...You know you can use your notebook between sessions Claireece. 
 MS. WEISS I mean you can use it specifically for trying to recover certain early memories. 
 MS. WEISS (beat) What are you thinking? 
 MS. WEISS Oh I doubt that Claireece. It seems like you're always thinking about something. 
 MS. WEISS It is, isn't it? As a matter of fact, I'm going to get myself something to drink. Would you like something to drink Claireece? 
 MS. WEISS What kind? 
 MS. WEISS Oh c'mon, you must. 
 MS. WEISS Okee Dokee. 
 MS. WEISS Back in a jiffy. 
 MS. WEISS You know your mother's been calling here wanting to come visit. 
 MS. WEISS Would you like her to come to a counseling session with you? 
 MS. WEISS Well that's just one more thing to consider before I see you next week. 
 ... 'phenomenal' 
 Get a grip and gon' read the report and don't get all emotional about what this silly hoe got to say. Anyway, if your shit wasn't dope you wouldn't be standing up here readin' -what, what's her name (looks up on the page) 
 ...Nice. 
 'outward'... 
 PRECIOUS & JERMAINE Whatever. 
 'eagerly' 
 'Although she is in school now, it is not a job readiness program. Nonetheless, Claireece is capable of going to work. In January, her son will be two years old. In keeping with the new initiative on welfare reform, I feel Claireece would benefit from any of the various workfare programs in existence. Despite her obvious intellectual limitations she is quite capable of working as a home attendant.' 
 Hush! 'My rapp-o-r-t with Precious is minimal. Although I am not sure with whom, she evidently has access to counseling services provided by Each One Teach One. She has a history of sexual abuse and is H.I.V. positive.' 
 That's the bitch's job, to get the mofuckin' goods on you! (continuing) 'The client seems to view the social services, AFDC, as taking care of her forever.' 
 You better put this shit back before you get in trouble. We talk about it with Ms. Rain in the morning. 
'S (0.S.) And don't be coming back late for his bad ass neither. 
 MS. RAIN Time is up. Does anyone want to share? 
 MS. RAIN Okay Precious. 
 What happened? 
 How you know? 
 Next time get mine's too. 
 And what kinda shit is it for someone like Precious to have quit school before she get her G.E.D. to work at some live-in job for some old-ass crackers. She'll never make a rise she get stuck in some shit like that! 
 MS. RAIN Sit up straight Jermaine and watch your language. Both of you. Please. 
 MS. RAIN Now I see your points, but is stealing... 
 MS. RAIN You read the whole thing by yourself? 
 Rhonda home attend. Say old bitch would ring a bell when she want Rhonda in the night! 
 Rhonda used to have to go all the way out to Brighton Beach where she work for them people. 
 Rhonda say old bitch would ring a bell - a actual bell -when she want Rhonda in the night! 
 MS. RAIN No! So stop worrying about it. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Trust me -no, trust yourself. My concern now is that if this Ms. Weiss is someone you're working with and can't trust, she's out! We gotta find somebody else. 
 Incest. 
 Well it ain't what you been saying. 
 One's where your family molest you, the other is like a roach or bugs. 
 MS. RAIN Precious, have you ever had your hearing tested?

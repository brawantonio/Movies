 Huh? 
 Hold on a minute.

 Quit playing. 
 Huh? 
 Nah, I'll roll with you a few more stops. 
 Make sure you get home okay. 
 (to bus driver) That's alright man--next stop. Next stop! 
 You ain't gotta push me, why're you beastin'? 
 You got a problem. Call me. 
 You late. 
 Where you been this late? 
 Movie ended at midnight. 
 (whispering) Don't push me. 
 I know what stays open past midnight. 
 Good night Lee! 
 (O.S.) Lee? Lee?! 
 Nice to know you still live here. 
 AUDREY (CONT'D) What're you doing home so late, anyway? 
 You know what time your curfew is. Where were you? 
 The show ended at midnight. And your curfew is twelve thirty. 
 At least you were cute. Where'd you get that shirt? `Princess'. I like that. 
 Compliments your figure. I saw something just like it on sale, maybe we could go shopping-- 
 I really don't care for that young lady you run around with anyway. 
 And tie your head up. 
 AUDREY(CONT'D) It's your head. And you really should wash your face, too. 
 Wash your face anyway. 
 Watch your tone. (Beat) Well, it's your skin. 
 (O.S.) Did you brush your teeth? 
 (O.S.) Lee? 
 (O.S.) Lee? 
 As promised, I will be grading these on a curve. 
 MRS. ALVARADO (O.S.) Hey there! 13. 
 MRS. ALVARADO Whaddja bring me? 
 MRS. ALVARADO You shouldn't be eatin' that crap, either. 
 MRS. ALVARADO Sooo, where's the new stuff? 
 MRS. ALVARADO Hmmm. 
 ALIKE (CONT'D) I'll probably do it in class. 
 MRS. ALVARADO So what? 14. 
 MRS. ALVARADO They're okay. 
 MRS. ALVARADO They're lovely. Of course your descriptiveness and use of alliteration is beautiful and all, you know that. But...I don't know. Is it your best? No. 
 MRS. ALVARADO It's good. Not great. 
 MRS. ALVARADO I believe you can go deeper. 
 Oh, so your log is all up to date? 
 No I-- 
 And you've checked the round for any calls? 
 Well I -- 15. 
 Do you even know which doctors are on the floor? 
 No ma'am I-- 
 Then I suggest you get busy. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Hey girl! Mind if I sit here? 
 No, not at all. Help yourself. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Whatchu got there? You been shopping? 
 Oh, no. Just some yogurt. Some vanilla yogurt. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY No I meant in the bag. What do you have in the shopping bag--the big red thing? 
 Oh I'm...I don't know where my mind is...Yeah, this is just uh--well let me get your opinion. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Oh that's nice. 
 Yeah see isn't this cute? 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Umm-hmm. That's for your daughter? 
 Yeah, this is for Alike. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY The youngest one. 
 No she's the oldest one. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Oh, the other one. Okay. 
 What, you think it's too young? 
 MRS. SINGLETARY No, no. For whatever reason the youngest one popped in my mind first. But I think it should be fine. It's really cute. 
 Thank you. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY It'll compliment her figure. 
 Now see that's what I thought... But Lee doesn't like anything I pick out for her anymore. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Girl, please. My oldest, 17 going on 27 mind you, banned me from buying her any more clothes. We have two completely different tastes. I just give her gift cards now and trust me, we're both happier for it. Is it her birthday? 17. 
 No, no. I just wanted to get her something nice. You know. 
 Well, no we-- 
 MRS. SINGLETARY None of yo' damn business!! 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Let me know how it goes. 
 Oh I will. I'll call you when-- 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Is that her?! 
 I don't see why we can't just watch TV like usual. 
 Quit it! 
 You don't tell me what to do! 
 Girls. 
 I'm expecting a call. 
 This is your father's night off. 
 AUDREY (CONT'D) So straighten up. 
 Homecoming got moved this year. It's gonna be in September instead of October. 19. 
 Oh really? 
 Yeah. Which means I'll be able to go to Autumn Ball and the Homecoming Dance. 
 Who are you going with? 
 I don't know. Maybe Derek. If he asks me. Maybe Parrish. I haven't decided yet. But for homecoming, I definitely want to go with Craig. 
 Oooh, I see. Lee, who are you going with? 
 Not going? This is your junior year. How can you not go? 
 Leave her alone Audrey, if doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to go. 
 But it's her junior year, she's not gonna have any memories. 
 I don't like all those boys buzzing around my daughters anyway. 
 Nobody buzzes around Alike. 
 That's right and it better stay that way. Matter of fact, I don't know if I'ma let you go. 
 Daaa-aad?! 20. 
 How much we paid him last time? 
 Six twenty-five. 
 So that makes--we owe another two seventy-five for the rest of the month. 
 LAURA (CONT'D) Electric? 
 Half. 
 Phone? 
 Let it ride. 
 Gas? 
 How much? 
 Eighty-five. 
 Half. No let it ride. 
 I can get some more hours-- 
 No. You know what you need to do. 
 Nah Candy, I can't just dip out on you like that-- 
 I was doing just fine before you moved in, remember? I can handle it. 
 CANDACE (CONT'D) You working was only supposed to be temporary. Mom would've wanted-- 
 Who?! Man, don't even-- 
 She would've-- 
 Stop. 
 LAURA (CONT'D) I'll get the money orders in the morning. 
 LAURA (CONT'D) I'll look into it alright? 
 The next test is coming up soon! 22. 
 (O.S.) I said I'll look into it! 
 MIKA'S FRIEND It was like seven of us--Me, Khalil, Misha, Tamara.... 
 #2 Tamara Marks? 
 MIKA'S FRIEND Heeeell no--Fat Tamara. 
 Oh I was about to say, Tamara Marks is a ughh--I can't stand her. 
 MIKA'S FRIEND Anyway, it was all of us and oh Laura, you know that girl from the restaurant? She was there with one of her friends. 
 That gay chick? Ya'll be hanging like that? 
 MIKA'S FRIEND Yeah, well it's a couple of them. She's mad cool though, so sometime she come out with us every now and then, anyway-- 23. 
 Man, y'all be doin' it on it weekends, let me find out! 
 #2 I told your butt to come. 
 MIKA'S FRIEND But anyway-- 
 Some of them AG's are kinda cute-- I'm not saying I would, but I would holla. 
 #2 I don't know about all that. 
 Isn't that one of them over there? What's her name? Amika?--Alisha? 
 MIKA'S FRIEND Alike. 
 Yeah, Alike--she's cute too. 
 #2 Uugh. I don't be looking at them all like that. 
 Look, I'm not gay--but if I was gay I might talk to her. 
 MIKA'S FRIEND She's in the middle anyway. 
 Yeah, but if she was just a little more harder-- 
 `Sup ladies? 
 MIKA'S FRIEND Oooh--let me find out, Mika. You act like you bi- or something. 
 I like girls but I love boys. 
 Watch out, it's slippery. 
 I already told you what I think. 
 I said I know of her, I don't know her know her. 
 Just put those on that stack right there. Yeah, thank you. 
 I'm listening--all I'm saying is-- pass me that milkshake mix right there. 
 All I'm saying is that I don't think you should put yourself out there like that. Especially if you don't even know if she likes you like that. 
 How do you know she does? 
 Hmmph. We'll see. 
 I thought I felt a drop of pig shit. 
 All I know is I been trying to get you to holla at girls in the club for the longest. 
 Obviously. Why you pressed about this chick? 
 Oh God, what now? 
 What?! 
 What?! 
 WHAAAAAT???!! You trying to strap!!?? Whaaatt?!! Oh my God, what are you going through... 
 What difference you think having a bulge in your pants gon' make? 
 Next Friday?! Okay-- Whatever. Oh my God I can't believe you ! Alright. Yeah. She better be cute for all of this... 
 I think it looks natural. 
 I'm serious, I mean it doesn't look that bad. 
 What?! 
 Well, first of all-- I don't think its supposed to be on top of your underwear like that. 
 It's supposed to fit like that. 
 I didn't have time for all of that. The brown ones were too big, anyway. 
 I can't take it back. 
 Unh-unh. I'm not going back in there. One time was embarrassing enough. 
 Still what if somebody would see me in there? I'm not going back, that's it. 
 Lee, where'd you put my make-up case...AHHH I'M GON' TELL. OOH LEE, I'MA TELL DADDY! 
 Eeew get that thing, off a me! Get it off me it's nasty! I'm tellin'!

 You can't tell.

 It looks nasty. 
 Where's my make up case?    I know you got it. 
 Give it back. 
 Give it back. 
 LEE, STOP IT EEEW!!! I just got that one. 
 Shhh!! 
 Don't touch it with that... eeww that's so nasty. C'mon Lee give it back. 
 Then promise you won't tell. 
 Ughh, I hate you. 
 OK, OK I won't tell.   Daag! 
 I'm still tellin' 
 Tellin' what? 
 ALIKE                           SHARONDA Noth--                           She took my makeup again. 
 Lee... (notices Laura) Oh. Hello Laura, I didn't see you standing there. 
 Hi Mrs. Freeman. 
 How's your mother? 31. 
 I haven't spoken to her in awhile. She's fine. 
 Well I hope so. And I'm so glad to hear your sisters finally getting back on her feet. Wasn't she-- 
 She's good. 
 I think we'll just leave this open. Let some air circulate in here. 
 I was just about to leave, anyway. So... 
 Just try it. 
 Will you chill? You just gotta get used to it. 
 Sit still, people gon' think you got something. 
 You not gon' take it off. 
 Where you gonna take it off at? 
 Then where you gon' put it? You gonna walk around the club with a dick in your hand? Chill. I knew we shouldn't have done this. You blowin' me right now. 
 Nah, you're `bout to stay and go through this. You're the one who wanted to meet her, not me. 
 You alright? 33. 
 You wanna switch seats? 
 And you don't wanna dance? 
 Hey ya'll we're about to go dance! 
 Well you don't mind right? I mean you don't mind if I go dance with somebody else? 
 If you change your mind-- 
 I hope it was worth it. 
 Save it. 34. 
 Oh I know it won't. 
 (O.S.) Turn that mess off!! 
 (O.S.) Sharonda?! Sharonda are you ready?! Stop lollygagging! 
 (O.S.) I'm coming! 
 Lee are you ready?! Lee?! 
 AUDREY (CONT'D) I said off. Thought you were ready? 35. 
 You're not going to church looking like that. Where's the blouse I bought you? 
 Hey there, you're home early--well actually late. I thought you would have called-- 
 Do what your mom says. 
 Are you hungry? Let me heat it up for you. 
 AUDREY (CONT'D) I'll heat it up on the stove for you. Tastes better. 
 Lee! 36. 
 Leave me out of it. 
 Go get changed. 
 Nothing. 
 I'm not gonna argue with you. 
 Do what she says. 
 (speaking bad Tarzan Swahili) Umgowa! 
 And put on a skirt! 
 Hey Dad! 
 Too much lipstick. 
 It's lipgloss. 
 SHARONDA (CONT'D) Okay, okay. 
 Gimmie kiss. 
 Did you talk to her? 
 Get me a beer, please. Sharonda's fine. 
 I'm talking about Lee. 
 Alike. And I don't see that there's a problem. 
 I'm tired of this tomboy thing she's got going on. And Laura. You said you were going to handle it. 
 Umm-hmm. 
 She needs a male point of view. 
 I said okay, dammit! Now can I please have a beer please? 
 It's Sunday morning. 
 It goes with the spaghetti. 
 Do you have to work tonight? 
 To put food on the table and clothes on our backs, no. To go out to restaurants and keep designer sneakers in the closet, yes. 
 Are you forever gonna be mad? 38. 
 Are you forever going to be happy? (beat) You made that decision a long time ago. 
 We both made sacrifices. 
 You look beautiful, baby. 
 Tuck your blouse in. 
 Tuck your blouse in. 
 Leave it out. 
 ARTHUR (CONT'D) I think it's fine out. What's the deal with you and Laura? 
 Comin' in late... 
 Why don't you give that a break for a little while? 
 (to Alike) You heard him! (MORE) 39. 
 (O.S.) Coming! 
 You coming with us? 
 Nope. Sleep. 
 We could go to a later service. The one o'clock-- 
 I said NO!! 
 I'm ready. 
 Alike, you look beautiful. Everybody looks beautiful, okay? 
 Lee! Lee! Here's someone I want you to meet. 
 ALIKE (CONT'D) Oh. Hey. 
 Get down out the car and come speak. 
 AUDREY (CONT'D) What's wrong with you? 
 You'll have to excuse her, she's been feeling rude lately. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Oh don't worry, Audrey, I understand how it is. Hormones. It's just a phase. 
 Alike, this is Mrs. Singletary, one of my co-workers and her daughter, Bina. Sylvia, Bina, this is my daughter Alike, we call her "Lee" for short. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Hello. 
 Hi. 41. 
 And this is my youngest daughter, Sharonda. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Hi there, nice to meet you. 
 Lee, Bina goes to the same school as you. 
 Yeah, I think I've seen you around. Mrs. Alvarado's class right? AP English? 
 So. Now that we're all acquainted, don't be a stranger. 
 MRS. SINGLETARY Oh no, we won't. 
 Bina I think you and Lee may even go to school the same way. Don't you live off of St. James Place? 
 MRS. SINGLETARY There is something to be said for safety in numbers. 
 Alrighty, I'll be around. Take care. 
 I don't know what your problem is. 
 Can somebody put in this CD please? 
 I know God doesn't make mistakes. I know that much. 
 AUDREY (CONT'D) You may not like Bina, but you're certainly gonna be spending much less time with that Laura person, I guarantee you that much. 
 Moooom, can you-- 
 Be quiet. Nobody's putting in anything. I'm gonna listen to what I want to listen to for a change. 
 Look, I don't like lying to my mother, that's all. 
 She does.    She asks me everyday. 
 No, I'm sick of lying to cover for you. 
 Look Alike, Lee. Whatever it is you wanna be called. I'm not trying to hang out with you, either, but I'm not about to take an L for it. So stop dodging me, let's just go to school together and be done with it. We don't have to see each other any other time than that. 
 BINA (CONT'D) Whatever, my mother asks me again, I'm telling her. Then she can tell your mother, then it's whatever for you. 
 ALIKE (CONT'D) Hey! 
 ALIKE (CONT'D) Hey look, I'm sorry. 
 Yeah, you sorry your mom is gonna bug out. 
 But? 
 ALIKE (CONT'D) So what's your favorite class? 
 You don't have to make small talk. Let's just walk. 
 Overprotective? 
 I can tell. I've seen--I mean, a lot of people's parents are like that. 45. 
 Yeah. 
 Anyway, like I said, we don't have to talk. Just walk. 
 How's it comin'? 
 It's good. 
 Oh my God!! 
 ARTHUR (CONT'D) That's just embarrassing! 
 Yeah but at least I hit the backboard. Damn. 
 What's the score?

 He don't mean nothin'! He don't know what he's talking about! 
 MACK (CONT'D) He ain't moved outside a two-mile radius of where he crawled out his mammy's pussy. He don't know shit. 50.

 Oh because, I was just gonna say-- I'm going to this house party and you can come if you want to. 
 BINA (CONT'D) They play this kind of music.

 Oh. 
 Cool. (beat) You could spend the night if want to. Avoid the whole curfew thing. 
 You sure? 
 Easy, easy now. Watch your right hand side. 
 Don't ride the brakes though. Good. 
 I don't about that. You're shaky girl, you're shaky. Get us some chips and I'll think about it. 
 Hey, baby! 
 I see Alike's been running circles around you again! 
 Little bit, little bit. I still got it though. 
 We better get going. 
 MACK (CONT'D) Gone already? 
 I'll holler at you later. 
 ARTHUR (CONT'D) Get in the car. 
 I said get in the car! 
 Look...umm...you know you're daddy's girl, right? 
 Oh you're home? 
 Hey. 
 I must've dozed off. How long have you been in? 
 Hour. 
 Did you see the plate in there? 
 This is fine. 
 There's room over here. You can see the TV better. 
 This is fine. 
 ARTHUR (CONT'D) Thank you. 
 Just alike. 
 Say what? 76. 
 You and your daughter. Have you talked to Lee yet? I told you she-- 
 I talked to Alike. 
 You did? 
 Everything's fine. Like I told you. Matter fact, she's got a boyfriend. 
 Boyfriend? 
 Just give her some space. 
 Space? She's hardly ever home in the first place and you're just like her, creeping in all hours of the night. Both of you. Running around like you got something to hide, like I'm the big, bad witch and what about me? I'm home by myself all the time and Sharonda's getting older and starting to go out and pretty soon-- 
 I don't have anything to hide. Look I told you I talked to Alike and everything is fine. 
 Did you ask her? 
 No, because I didn't have to. Besides,I would know okay? If anybody would know, it would be me. I know my daughter-- 
 Your daughter?!! 
 --better than anyone else and-- 77. 
 So now all of a sudden she's just your daughter?! 
 ARTHUR                          AUDREY --I'm telling you she's just    Well I guess I better not fine!!                          have nothing else to say then, huh?! 
 That's your damn problem, you're too much of a damn worry wart. 
 Let's hope you're right, Detective. 
 Will you shut the fuck up?! 
 An hour? Really? I'm not your dumb damn floozy in the street. And you will not talk to me that way. 
 I'm not. 
 SHARONDA (CONT'D) Lee? 
 I hope you know it doesn't matter to me. 
: 
 ALIKE (CONT'D) She's hot right? I told you. It was so tight. I'm tellin' you, you shoulda been there tonight! 
 This one's just for me and you. 
 ALIKE (CONT'D) I was thinking next weekend the three of us could-- 
 Look, I'm right here. 
 ALIKE (CONT'D) Oh my bad, I thought you were beside me. Anyway, I was thinking-- 
 Look, I'm sorry for all the drama. 
 What I'm saying is, I probably overreacted. (beat) And then...I don't know. Seeing you two together or whatever. I'm glad to see you're finally happy. 
 You don't need to say anything. I just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm happy for you, that's all. 
 LAURA (CONT'D) Because I love you, alright? And I'm sayin'...I'm right here.

 ARTHUR (CONT'D) Remember our old place? Waaay out in Queens? It was our first apartment, we were so proud. Had all those trees around it? In October, the whooole block would be covered with leaves. You remember. 
 ARTHUR (CONT'D) You couldnt've been more than 2 years old. And when the wind would blow, all those leaves would come rushing down the street at us and you thought they were alive. You'd get so scared. You'd cry and you'd scream and beg for us to pick you up. I would try and tell you "they're only leaves, baby" and make you stay on the ground. But you were so afraid and you cried so hard, your mother would always pick you up. She always picked you up. 
 ARTHUR (CONT'D) `Member how we used to-- 
 California's a long way away--

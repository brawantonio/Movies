 Sebastian, do you know what time it is? SEBASTIAN (SCREEN) You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it was waste of time. 
 What is it this time? INTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer window. He notices something behind her in the bed, the young man sleeping face down. SEBASTIAN Who s that? Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed. 
 Not your business. Not anymore. SEBASTIAN Touche. 
 So you calling about anything in particular, or were you just hoping to catch me sleeping in the nude? SEBASTIAN I cracked the reversion. Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline. 
 You cracked it? SEBASTIAN Look at this. Sebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the molecular structure appears on Linda s computer. SEBASTIAN Watch this. 
 You sure? SEBASTIAN 91% sure. 
 (astonished) Eleven months with no progress and you suddenly come up with it out of the blue? How? SEBASTIAN The usual. Coffee and twinkies. 
 I hate you. SEBASTIAN I know. You think you could hunt down Matt and get to the lab early. I want Isabelle prepped for a live test. 
 Yeah, I think I can find him. What are you going to do? SEBASTIAN Well y know. It s daylight in Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel Committee and tell them to get our prizes ready. See you in a few. ON S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake. 
 Hey... come on. DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under sheets. 
 (groggy) What? 
 Sebastian just called. We gotta get to the lab. Matt bolts up. 
 Shit! You didn t tell him I was here, did you? 
 Give me some credit, will ya. 
 So what s the rush? 
 He cracked reversion. Matt pulls his jeans on. 
 Wanna ride down? 
 We better take our own cars. 
 You re gonna have to tell him about us eventually. 
 I know. It s just You re his best friend. He ll feel betrayed. EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. SKYLINE - DAY From a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in the harsh light of morning. CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security fence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire. The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight into the warehouse. INT. WAREHOUSE -DAY The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the warehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16. 
 Morning, sir. SEBASTIAN Morning, Ed. 
 Your team s in early. Something special going on? SEBASTIAN Sorry, Ed. You know the rules. Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A laser reads his print. Scan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN Clearance:    ALPHA ALPHA THREE Division:	CLASSIFIED The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside. 
 Have a good day, sir. INT. ELEVATOR - DAY Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian taps in his floor code. 
 (V.0.) Authorization please. SEBASTIAN Caine zero zero two seven. 
 (V.0.) Authorization verified. Good morning, Dr. Caine. The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes below us and keeps descending into the belly of the earth, the shaft goes down forever. INT. HABITAT S CORRIDOR We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas chambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a specific animal, although no animals are visible. As we pass one habitat, something slams into the Plexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen animal cries. THUMP. 
. The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals are seen. Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but they remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly empty cage. 
 Isabelle ... The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The Plexiglas begins to shake violently. (cont d) Calm down baby. Calm down. It s okay... Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and pulls them down over his eyes. THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in shape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the Plexiglas door and reaches inside. (cont d) It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not going to hurt you. Come here. THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs hold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature. (cont d) Just hold still. Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. Blood erupts in a bite pattern. (cont d) Ow, shit. Matt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies open and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see the heat signature running down the hallway. He turns around to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the Corridor. 
 You okay? 
 She bit me. 
 Yeah. She s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days. Linda takes the goggles from Matt. (cont d) Go take care of that bite. I ll get her. 
 And give you a chance to pull ahead? Never. Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt. AROUND THE CORNER A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS. Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a haunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed though and something large and angry is throwing itself against it. We can t see anything. A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, wearing goggles and leveling their pistols. 
 (ala Porky) Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting simians.   heheheheh. 
 Knock it off. (soothing voice) Isabelle! THERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering heat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda fires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air. Then falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it stops inches above the ground. THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at Linda s feet. 
 Good shootin , Tex. 
 What s that make it? 
 I m still ahead. 6 to 5. Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from the top of her tranquilizer gun. 
 But I m catching up. INT. CORRIDOR - DAY The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met by SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head. 
 Can I have a word? SEBASTIAN Most normal people say good morning. 
 Don t you think you should test the protocol on the liver samples before you inject Isabelle? SEBASTIAN How many tissue samples have we successfully regressed? Hundreds, right? How many have gone on to work on the full system? None. 
 That s beside the point. SEBASTIAN No, that is the point. I m not going to waste six months of my life on an outmoded testing procedure. This thing works. I know it. I feel it. Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail end of the conversation. 
 Fine. You can mop up afterward. SEBASTIAN You think I m going to kill Isabelle? 
 Kill? More like liquefy. SEBASTIAN Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but I m the project leader. Understand? She says ... 
 Yes, Sir. ... but somehow it feels like  Fuck you.  She storms off. Sebastian turns to Linda. SEBASTIAN How did you ever convince me to hire her? 
 You said you wanted the beat vet in the country. SEBASTIAN Yeah, well she cares more about the animals than the research. 
 Maybe that s why she s so good. 
 As we pull out we see we are. INT. LABORATORY - DAY Almost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical readouts, bizarre medical equipment. On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over a humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. The straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the body to lots of machinery. 
 Protocol is hot. SEBASTIAN Vitals? Sarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, blood pressure, the rest. 
 Normal. CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in a cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the table and pushes aside the sheet. 
 THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY. GOD HAS SPOKEN. SEBASTIAN How many times do I have to tell you, Frank you aren t God. (beat) I am. 
 FRANK (LOUDSPEAKER) Sorry, Boss. Forgot. Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the Laboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the booth. SEBASTIAN You guys ready to roll? INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH FRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab. They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists. The room is crammed with electronic and recording equipment. A handful of monitors display different images of the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen monitors vital signs. 
 We are live and in color. On your mark. Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues. Sebastian nods their way. SEBASTIAN Okay. Roll  em. 
 Okay. We are rolling record on videos one through twelve. Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a microphone. Recording. INT. LABORATORY - DAY Frank s voice echoes through the chamber. 
 (V.O.) Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in phase shift... one hundred twenty six days, eighteen hours. 
 Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting serial protein Caine One Two Five. Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a centrifuge nearby. 
 Maybe if you stopped naming them after yourself, you d have better luck. SEBASTIAN Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for that keen scientific observation. I ll be sure to include it in my memoirs. 
 A whole mention? And I thought I was just gonna be a footnote. Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid. INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH 
 Okay. Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals. INT. LABORATORY - DAY Tension in the air. SEBASTIAN (to Linda) Ready. She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the surface several times. A small bulge appears, like a vein. 
 Propped. 
 Let s make some history. Matt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the hypo from Matt s hand. SEBASTIAN Nice try, Sparky. Matt relinquishes the needle. 
 Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. Sebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface. Matt presses down on the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. It s the shape of a vein. The liquid begins to react. Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up. 
 Elevated heartbeat. INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH Janice analyzes the screens. 
 We re still in the green. 
 Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal range. INT. LABORATORY The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex webbing of a bloodstream appears. 
 It s reacting. Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes visible.. the shadow of a skeletal system. SEBASTIAN Do you see this? 
 It s working. It s actually working. Matt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs. 
 Heart rate s up. She s scared. Sarah soothes her. (cont d) It's okay, baby. It's okay. SEBASTIAN Subject began manifesting almost Immediately. Protocol is reacting quickly. Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She begins to howl. 
 Subject may be in pain or extreme discomfort. 
 Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. Brain activity going through the roof. The brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out. The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the inside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror. (cont d) We ve got a problem. SEBASTIAN What? What problem! Sarah checks her monitors. 
 It s her heart. We can see the heart beating in the ape s 
 (V.0.) I got an erratic heart beat. 
 She s going into cardiac arrest. 
 Got the crash cart. Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in. 
 We re losing her. Her machine flatlines. SEBASTIAN No! It s got to work. The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in decomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together. 
 Clear! Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again. 
 We ve got something! The heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its march toward,visibility. (cont d) Still. erratic. 
 Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do it. You can fucking do it. Everybody s pulling for her. 
 Come on, monkey. 
 Do it. Do it. Come on. Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists and turns, frightened. Then skin. The monkey howls. Skin forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being painted on before our eyes. 
 Stabilizing. The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as if it was discharging some stored energy. 
 (V.0.) Brain activity returning to normal. The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda hovers over it stroking its fur. 
 Welcome back, Isabelle. Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move that does not go unnoticed by Matt. We did it. SEBASTIAN (beat) How is she? 
 (surprised) I think she s gonna be okay 
 Amazing. She's normal, absolutely healthy. If you didn't know any better, you'd think nothing had happened to her. 
 (ribbing Sarah) Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her brain and trace her neural pathways. 
 Screw you, Matt. 
 Well maybe not right away. 
 We should celebrate. 
 I thought you'd gone. 
 A little "I am become death... the shatterer of worlds"? 
 Since the day I met, all you wanted to do was change the world. 
 You're positively maudlin. You should be happy. Do you have any idea what you've accomplished? 
 What was that about? 
 Nothing. It's just... He is who he is. Sometimes I just have to be reminded. 
. 
 But now? 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) But now... (pause) But now, we feel we are closer than ever to resolving this issue. We've been experimenting with a new regression formula that looks rather promising. A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward. 
 Yo. Reality check! What the hell was that about? 
 The protocol works. Why'd you tell them it didn't? 
 But they're the oversight committee. They're supposed to know. 
 I'm sure he had a reason. (firmly) You did have a reason, didn't you, Sebastian? 
 It's their money, Sebastian. It's going to happen eventually. 
 Well, then... mind telling us how you're gonna get a human test-subject for phase three without the committee finding out? 
 Are you nuts? 
 Yeah. Pretty sure he was. 
 And remember, for every Jonas Salk, there are a bunch of guys who aren't famous cuz they died. 
 Isn't it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway? 
 She's right. We haven't even finished collating the phase two research. 
 You don't even know if any of the protocols will work on humans. 
 Sebastian ... humans can talk, build houses and cook in microwave ovens. Gorilla's live in trees. That's a helluva 2% if you ask me. 
 Why you? Why not one of us? 
 (interrupting) What if we volunteer? 
 What if you're too valuable to lose? 
 To put your affairs in order? 
 In the past six years, I've never once challenged your decisions, but this ... Sebastian. I don't think you should do this. 
 Oh please. How long were we together? You must've said it a million times ... Nobody knows who built the lunar lander. All they remember in the first man on the moon. 
 He refuses to listen to reason. 
 Can we talk about this later? I'm trying to make love to you. 
 Sorry. I just can't let it go. 
 I know how you're feeling. Hell, he and I've been friends since freshman year. 
 So how can we let him do this? 
 What if you were given the opportunity to be the first person on ,Mars, would you go? 
 In a heartbeat. 
 What if they didn't know whether or not they could get you home? 
 Let me ask another question. 
 Is about who gets to be on top? 
 Is the human race really ready for what we're doing? 
 Why do you always get philosophical before we're about to get physical? 
 No really. Is it ready? We're barrelling down a road that begs moral and ethical questions that I don't think we can answer. 
 They said the same thing about the bomb. They said we'd never survive the nuclear age... but here we are. 
 This night is still young. (beat) I mean, when you think about it, it's creepy. Do we really want to live in a world where people can just disappear in the blink of an eye? 
 We made our deal with the devil years ago. Might as well stick around to cash in. 
 We're ready. 
 It's not too late to back out. I'm happy to take your place. 
 Nervous? 
 Ever tell you the one about Superman and Wonder Woman? 
 So Superman's flying around the city, and he's horny as hell.  Lo and behold he looks down and sees Wonder Woman, completely nude, sunning herself up on the roof of the Justice League. I mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle. So Superman starts thinking, "man... this is too easy. I could go down there, do a little fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me." After all he is faster than a speeding bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down, takes care of business so quick, you can't even see him. Well ... I tell ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised as hell and says "What the hell was that." And the Invisible Man replies "I dunno know, but it sure hurt like hell." 
 C'mon, man. That's funny shit. 
 O.K. How're you feeling? 
 Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit elevated. 
 No reason for concern. He's ready. 
 Start recording. 
 We're hot. All systems nominal, Houston. 
 Okay, kids. Let's make some history. 
 Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs. 
 (to Linda) Ready. 
 We can still shut down, Sebastian. 
 Any last words? 
 Injection was administered at (checks watch) ... 18:23:47. 
 Vitals are stable. 
 Nothing's happening. 
 Human DNA structure is slightly more complex... it's possible that it may take more time... 
 Maybe we overlooked something. 
 Kinda like a firecracker with a bad fuse... 
 Frank? 
 (V.0.) (from the booth) No change in bio-electric. 
 Here we go. 
 Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 100. ... 130 ... 
 What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP TALKING! 
 Pulse is 165 ... 170 Blood pressure 180 over 100. ... 
 He's going to blow out his heart. 
 Prop the crash cart. 
 We've got to stop it! 
 We can't! 
 Something's happening. 
 Listen up! Electric activity increasing in all limbs. Brainwaves are through the roof. 
 I didn't think the human brain could spike that high. 
 Maybe it can't. 
 Pulse is 180 .... holding stable. 
 Holy shit. 
 Pulse is dropping. 170.. 150 .... 160.. 
 Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at 18:26. 
 Is he dead? 
 No. He passed out from the trauma. 
 Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110 ... dropping. Blood pressure 130 over 75. 
 (V.O.) Electrical activity is stabilizing. 
 Pulse steady at 70. 
 Un-fucking-believable. 
 (whispers in his ear) You did it, Sebastian. You're the first. 
 Let's get him into recovery. 
 S'okay. You nodded off. 
 His breathing's hypnotic. How long's it been? 
 Seventeen hours. 
 Where are the others? 
 In the lab crunching numbers. We've got enough data there for two lifetimes of research. 
 I keep looking at that hole, wondering if he's really there. 
 He may be coming out of it. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE The lights! Turn off the goddamn lights! Ah Christ! 
 Your eyelids are transparent. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE So I ... I'm... 
 Yes. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel them... 
 Your arms ... your whole body... It worked, Sebastian. It worked. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Mirror. I ... I want to see. 
 Over here in the corner. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I ... It's hard to think. 
 It was painful? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE At first... but then everything went black. I couldn't see or hear or feel anything. It was all just black... like I wasn't connected. 
 Your system received quite a shock. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE At least my senses are starting to return... You're wearing your Shalimar, aren't you? 
 Sebastian. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE This is weird. I'm looking through myself at the floor. I'm looking right through myself. I can't tell ... 
 Sebastian? 
 Sebastian? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You really can't see me. Can you? 
 Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea, headache, body-ache, disorientation. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE No, just tired. (beat) It's funny. I can see everything... more than before... but I can't see myself. 
 Hey. How's he doing? 
 Why don't you ask him? 
 Sebastian, how do you feel. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Not to bad, considering. 
 He can't close his eyes so they're sensitive to light. 
 So, what was it like? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Over here. 
 C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Sorry. Couldn't resist. 
 I feel like we're playing Marco Polo. 
 Well, I see the procedure hasn't changed your personality. 
 No worries. I'm on it. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Boy, you people have no sense of humor. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Stop there. 
 Index Mark. 112125. 
 It's late. Time you got some rest. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Just a little longer. 
 Hate to pull rank, but you're my patient now and you need rest. We've got a busy day tomorrow. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Fine. 
 We've set up a thermal camera for observation and I've arranged one of us to be here 24/7 in case you need anything. The team's gonna be on alpha- call alert for the duration. If anything goes wrong, we can all be here within... 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote the procedure. 
 I was trying to be reassuring. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You like this don't you? 
 What's that? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Being in charge. 
 Please. I'm just doing my job. 
 You gonna be okay? 
 Fine. It's not like I have anything else going on in my sad pathetic life. 
 Carter'll be in at six to spell you and I'll be in by nine. Call me if anything happens, okay? 
 I'm fine. Go on ahead. 
 Man, I'm tired. That was a long day. 
 Days only get longer from here. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (whispering) Sarah. Are you awake? 
 Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are you in here? 
 - 
 SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER) Dr. Caine, please report in. 
 SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER) Dr. Caine, report in please! 
 Shit. 
 I found him later in the lab, running samples. 
 Why didn't you call me? 
 Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not. I mean, I could've easily been dreaming. 
 It doesn't sound like something Sebastian would do. 
 God, I feel so stupid. 
 I can talk to him. 
 No. I mean... (she torn, unsure of herself) It was probably nothing. I shouldn't've mentioned it. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why would he do that, right? Just, this place at night can be kinda creepy, y'know. 
 So, how was your first night? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't close your eyes. 
 Yeah? What'd you do? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Got up a couple of times. Knocked about. 
 Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in your cubicle. She said she called you over the intercom and you didn't respond. 
 It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell whoever's on duty where you're going to. I mean, if something were to happen, we'd want to know where to find you. 
 It isn't. I just don't want it to become one. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Next I want to run a VV and UVF analysis of the platelets. 
 We'll have to draw some more blood. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You okay? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This might hurt a bit. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE No. I was looking at the clock. Why? 
 Just felt like someone was staring at me. 
 
 Sebastian? Goddamnit. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You've no idea how much fun I've had. I'm going to hate going back. 
 That's what worries me.? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE How so? 
 What happens when we turn the project over to the Army. Ever wonder how much fun they're gonna have? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Maybe we won't give it to them. His voice comes from behind her now. 
 Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Well, don't do it for me. Do it for science. 
 Grow up. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Oh well. Missed your big chance. 
 Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow. 
 Recording? 
 Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian Caine. Currently in phase shift... Three days, seven hours. 
 De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial Protein Caine One Two Seven. 
 Tough. 
 Okay, man. Here we go. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Wait... something... something doesn't feel right. 
 Heartbeat elevated. 
 Vitals still nominal.. 
 What's wrong? 
 He's not breathing. 
 Subject manifesting. 
 Pulse erratic. 
 Carter! 
 Get a tranq. Stat. 
 He's reverting. Got him on the table. 
 I got no pulse. No pulse. 
 Start CPR. 
 Getting a pulse. 
 Holy shit. What happened? 
 Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you hear me? How are his pupils? 
 I can't see his goddamn pupils! 
 I think he's going into shock. 
 A 
 Just got the tissue sample results. Cellular cohesion is stable. 
 Guess so. (beat) I was just thinking about the Apollo missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and Chaffee... What it was like for them on that launch pad that day, thinking they were gonna reach the stars only to burn to death. 
 Sometimes the test pilots make history. Sometimes the planes crash and people die. 
 But he didn't die, did he? (beat) What if we can't bring him back? What then? 
 It's just a little hitch is all. He'll be the first to tell that he'll crack it and I'm sure he will. It'll just take time. (beat) Listen, let's got out of here. We could drive up to the old observatory. We'll take some wine and go count the stars and forget all this for awhile. 
 No. I want to be here for him. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (weak) Hey... 
 Hey... 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You look worried. It must've been bad. 
 You almost died. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Well, remember your Nietchze. Whatever doesn't kill me, makes me stronger. 
 I should be making you feel better. Not vice versa. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I guess if I'm going to be stuck this way for awhile, I'd better make some adjustments. 
 Not too bad. 
 You could almost pass for human. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Well, it gives you a face to talk to at least, and we can all work in normal light again. 
 Could be the barium or the radiation. 
 You're physiology has changed and, well, all bets are off. 
 Do you want me to stay? 
 (surprised) Dr. Caine. What's up? 
 Going out? Hey wait a sec! 
 What do you mean going out for a bit? 
 But you're not supposed to leave the compound. 
 That's the rule. 
 You can't just change it. 
 Shit. 
 Yeah, it's Carter. We got a problem. 
 Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile? 
 You got that right, sir. I was beginning to worry 'cause your car hadn't moved. 
 He could be anywhere. Hell he could be right behind us. 
 I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna swing by his place, just in case. 
 See you there. 
 (quietly, looking around) I don't want him to see. 
 (looking around too) What a mess. 
 Sebastian? 
 Sebastian? 
 
 Oh shit. 
 What are the tranqs for? 
 Use your imagination. 
 Are you saying he's dangerous? 
 We're just saying we need to be cautious. 
 The Metro stops running after midnight and he's on foot, so he can't have gotten too far. 
 Look, this isn't a monkey we're talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't you think you're over reacting? 
 This program is classified. If he's out there it means someone might find out about him. He could destroy the whole program. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out. 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 Bullshit! I went to your apartment and I happen to know you did a helluva lot more than pick some stuff up. 
 You, of all people How could you? 
 I saw your face and your clothes. 
 It was bad enough you left without an escort, but to take off the... (he motions to his face) out in public? 
 That's not good enough. When you're outside the lab there are a thousand variables none of us can control. It's just not safe for you to be out there. 
 You volunteered for this, Sebastian. You knew going in there could be consequences. (beat) For the security of this project, I'm gonna have to ask you to confine yourself to the compound. 
 You're right. It's your decision. But if you leave the compound again, I'll notify the oversight committee. Then they can make the decision. You understand? 
 Sorry, man. You'd do the same if it were the other way around. 
 Pack 'em up... Everyone go home. 
 Hold still. 
 Not enough to worry about. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when a classified experiment disappears in the middle of the night, someone's gotta run the show. (tries sympathy) Look, I know how hard this has been for you. 
 Now it's a gift? 
 Where're you going? 
 Come on, man. We've got a ton of tests scheduled today. 
 Want to talk about it? 
 "We are the hollow men, the stuffed men, headpieces filled with straw." 
 I don't want to fight you. I just want what's best for the program. 
 You can be scared. That's okay. 
 You're talking like you've given up. It's only been a few months. 
 60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ... 85 ... 
 93% ... 95%... 95% 
 That's all we need. 
 Full quantum cascade at 95%. (beat) I'm sorry. 
 I don't blame him. 
 I'll go talk to him. 
 Leave him alone. He just needs to blow off some steam. 
 (V.0.) Yeah? 
 (V.0.) Don't you sleep? 
 Okay. I'm here if you need me. 
 How'd it go? 
 Quiet. He worked in the lab till about 10:30 and then went to sleep. 
 Good morning. 
 Why so cheery this morning? 
 I'm happy if I make it to my coffee machine. 
 I restructured the third genome on your radiated protein strand. Thought you might want to take look. 
 I thought you'd want to take a look at it. 
 I'm telling you, I know him. Something's going on. 
 Think he knows about us. 
 If he knew about us, he'd be angry and that wasn't angry. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE When you were a kid, you ever dream about being invisible? 
 Sure... all the time. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE What did you imagine you'd do? 
 The usual. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE What's the usual? 
 Hanging out in the girl's locker room. Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Jimmy Margiani? 
 School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am. Back then, I was the size of a small planet and made a rather large target. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Ever think up anything along the grand scale? 
 Sure. World domination. Manipulating stock markets, consolidating a political power base. But those are more recent fantasies. 
 I don't know, man. Out in the real world... I mean, there's a responsibility... 
 Hell, I try and do that now. 
 I read that in a survey at a major university they asked college students "Would you steal if you were guaranteed to get away with it?" 82% said yes. 
 So, Doc what did you do? 
 When you were out. 
 Aw, you just walked around? Come on. There's more, right? 
 Man, I'd be walking up to people saying shit like "This is God, go,get a haircut." Or hanging out in the changing room at Victoria's Secret. 
 Well, did you see anybody? 
 Yeah? And did you mess with her? 
 SEBASTIAN'S POV 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Goodnight. 
 It's fine. I just didn't know you were there. Goodnight. 
 What was it? 
 I don't know. I don't see anything. 
 Hello? 
 Thanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye. (hangs up phone) Phew. 
 Relax... it's nothing. Where were we? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Be quiet! 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing. 
 You awake? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I am now. 
 Notice anything unusual last night. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE No. Why? 
 Franklin Three. He's dead. 
 His neck was broken and his windpipe collapsed. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE How'd that happen? 
 I thought maybe you could tell me. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Sarah... You saying I had something to do with it? 
 He was alive last night when I left and he was dead this morning. And you were the only one down here. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I was in my room all night. 
 That's all twelve hours. 
 He never left the room. 
 A windpipe doesn't just suddenly collapse. Someone or something killed it. 
 You saw the tape. The man was in his chamber. 
 Then we have a problem, because I the cage was locked from the outside. That means it was opened, the dog was killed and the cage was closed and locked again. Only a human could do that. 
 Well, it wasn't me. 
 And it wasn't him. 
 Are we sure? 
 Quiet night at home. Maybe a book. 
 He's still in the picture. Why? 
 Maybe someday I will. See you in the morning. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Hmmm. 
 (to Marine Guard) Forgot something. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE What the hell? 
 Pretty clever really. All it does is recycle the signal. He flips this switch, it takes a snapshot and that's all we see. 
 Asshole. 
 And you think he's violent? 
 He killed a dog with his bare hands. 
 Dogs aren't people. Are we in any danger? 
 Either way, we aren't equipped to handle this. We have to inform the committee. 
 What if he doesn't come back? 
 They'll go after him. (beat) Who has tonight's shift? 
 I do. 
 Pretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just do what you're doing so he doesn't become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot the committee deal with it. 
 SEBASTIAN'S POV 
 I'll call General Caster right now and convene the oversight committee tomorrow. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 What do we do in the meantime? 
 Just sit tight and wait for my call. 
 MRS. KRAMER What was that about? 
 Just a little trouble at work. 
 MRS. KRAMER You coming up? 
 In a minute. I have to make a few calls. 
 Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP! 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE What? No good morning for me? Don't you like me anymore? 
 Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE That's okay. It's going to be busy day. 
 When did he say held call? 
 He's probably meeting with the committee trying to figure out what to do. 
 I'm gonna call him. 
 What? 
 He's dead. Drowned in his pool last night. 
 Let me see that. 
 I'll be right back with help. 
 (V.0.) Authorization please. 
 Foster One Delta Eight Three Five. 
 (V.0.) Authorization invalid. Request denied. 
 That's a first. 
 (V.0.) Authorization please. 
 Foster One Delta Eight Three Five. 
 (V.0.) Authorization invalid. Request denied. 
 Let me try mine. 
 (V.0.) Authorization please. 
 Kensington Two Romeo One Five Nine. 
 (V.0.) Authorization invalid. Request denied. 
 Tell me this isn't happening. 
 We've got a problem. 
 How long before anybody starts looking for us? 
 There's no set check in procedure. It could be weeks. 
 Already in. It was only a second level encryption. 
 Some security system. 
 Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm just extraordinary. 
 What is it? 
 There's nothing wrong with the system. Our codes have been removed. 
 Removed? By who? 
 Here's a clue. Only one code remains. 
 Whose? 
 Dr. Sebastian Caine. 
 He's not in there. 
 Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us where you are. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me in. 
 Sebastian... where are you? 
 C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me. Tell me where you are and we can talk about it. 
 Sebastian! Sebastian! (beat) I want search parties. Thermal goggles and tranquilizers. 
 Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I'm here. 
 Doctor Caine? 
 Sebastian? 
 This is bad. 
 There's something over there. 
 - 
 What happened? 
 She was strangled. Multiple blows to her head. 
 Intercom... the phone lines. They're dead. 
 Gimme that. 
 What the fuck is going on here? 
 What? 
 Shhh. 
 Did you find him? 
 Janice is dead. 
 It's clear. 
 The man has checked out of reality. 
 What happened? I don't understand. 
 Isn't it obvious? Right now, we're the only ones who knows he exists. If he gets rid of us, no one knows and he becomes the most powerful man on earth. 
 But he's not a killer. 
 He wasn't. He is now. 
 Can you fix the elevator? Restore our codes? 
 It'd take hours to crack the encryptions. 
 Right now that sounds like good news. 
 So what do we do until then. Sit around waiting for him to kill us off? 
 No. We find him, before he finds us. 
 You sure this'll work. 
 We designed it to help find the rats we kept dropping in year one. They were too small for thermal scans. 
 Systems hot. Activating motion detectors. 
 I've got movement in Corridor Six. 
 That's him. 
 Got 'em. 
 (into walkie) Check. Check. 
 Just watch our backs. Hey Carter, ready? 
 Let's do it. 
 (into Walkie) Take a right at the next accessway. He's working his way back to the offices. 
 (Walkie - sotto) If we split up, can we trap him on corridor eight? 
 (V.0.) If he keeps heading in that direction. 
 Going Thermal. 
 I lost him. Matt, I lost him. 
 He probably just stopped moving. 
 It's me. 
 Do you have anything? 
 Nothing. 
 How did he get by us? 
 He couldn't. 
 Sebastian! We're here to help. Sebastian. 
 There. Behind those pipes. He's not moving. 
 (into walkie) We see him. But he's not responding. The heat signature doesn't move. 
 C'mon... C'mon... 
 Covered. 
 What the... 
 (V.0.) He was there. 
 Looks like... looks like we're pumping out heat... 
 (V.0.) I got movement again! He's right on top of you! 
 No fucking shit! 
 (choking) H...Help... MMmmphg 
 (into walkie) Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!? 
 Right on top of you. 
 (V.0.) What's going on? Are you okay? 
 Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from a head wound. 
 Matt, he's coming toward you. 
 Shit. 
 Got outta there. 
 He's close! 
 Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's shutting me in. 
 He's coming right at you! 
 Where? 
 Twenty, maybe thirty feet. 
 Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must be ghosts. 
 Those signatures ... they're coming from the heating vents. 
 I'm starting to lose resolution on my thermals. 
 Get out of there! 
 If the room temperature is the same as his body temperature, thermal visors'll be no good. 
 I'm going! 
 Linda...it's not safe. 
 That's why I'm going. (to Frank and Sarah) Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to the lab. We'll meet you there. 
 But... 
 Do it. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo... 
 Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You aren't thinking rationally. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she? 
 Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk this through. It's not too late. 
 MATT (CONT'D) C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm your friend. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I'm sorry, but I just feel that our friendship is holding me back. I'm sure you understand. 
 This way. 
 He'll be okay. 
 It's pretty severe. We have to get him to the lab. 
 He's got to be okay. 
 For godsakes, help me. 
 He was going to kill me. 
 I know. He's gone. 
 We've got to got out of here. 
 Habitats. 
 Oh god. That's right between us and the lab. 
 His pulse is faint. 
 Where are you going? 
 This'll hold him but he needs blood. 
 But... 
 Supply is right down the hall. I'll be two seconds. 
 Sarah, wait for the others 
 If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on the wound. 
 Ahh!  Shit! 
 He's let the animals out. It wasn't him we were tracking. 
 It won't kill me unless it gets infected. You? 
 Me .... Don't ask about me. If he freed all the animals, we could have dozens running around the lab. 
 So he could be anywhere right now. 
 Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors and pray to God Frank can reprogram the elevator. 
 Frank? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You missed. 
 Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me go. 
! 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I've always liked your feistiness. 
 Sarah! Sarah! (to Carter) Goddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you let up... Sarah! Sarah! 
 Where is she? 
 She went to the supply room. Carter needed blood. 
 I said no one goes anywhere alone. 
 She didn't listen. 
 He's dead. 
 Oh god. Sarah! 
 Her too? 
 This didn't happen. This hasn't happened. 
 It happened alright. Now we have to deal with it. 
 Yeah? And just what are we supposed to do now? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Now? Now you die. 
 He's here! 
 Where? 
 Sebastian! 
 LINDA (CONT1D) I don't know if you can understand this, but what you're experiencing is a psychological breakdown. This isn't who you are. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I would say that what I am experiencing is psychological awareness. I like you being in complete and absolute control. 
 You goddamn bastard! You goddamn bastard. You're gonna pay for this. I'm going to bring you back to visibility and then I'm going throw your ass in jail. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You're never gonna bring me back Linda. I never want to come back. 
 Fuck you! 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time for old times sake. 
 Don't listen to him. It's not worth it. 
 Come on, Matt. Let's go get the elevator back on-line so we can got out of this hell hole. 
 He does anything, anything at all, come get us. I'll be back to check on you in five. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Imagine you two, carrying on right under my nose. Out of curiosity, what did he give you that I couldn't? 
 Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man than you'll ever be. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If that's what you want... 
 Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No... 
 Jesus! 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Figured it out? You were always so clever. 
 No! 
 Get out of here! 
 (yelling) You won't get away with this. They'll find out about you. They'll hunt you down. 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE The villagers with their torches? Lock up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's not gonna happen that way. 
 How can you be so brutal? 
 SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I guess because I don't have to look at myself in the mirror anymore (beat) Remember that first night I was out? I did something bad, just to see if I could get away with it. And when I did, I realized I could have it all. I can kill in broad daylight. And nobody's gonna tell the police they were fucked by a ghost. Anything I desire I can make happen, but not if people know. 
 I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs. 
 Just keep going. I'll fix you later. 
 Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now. 
 He surprised us. We weren't expecting... 
 Shhh. Don't talk. 
 Lin... 
 You feel that? 
 A little... 
 Your losing blood, but he didn't hit the vitals. 
 Goddamnit. 
 What're you doing? 
 This is temporary. 
 Barely. 
 Just keeps getting worse. 
 Oh shit. 
 There's no way out. 
 There's got to be. 
 They say freezing to death isn't so bad. You just kinda pass out. 
 Matt! MATT! 
. 
 Authorization please? 
 Authorization valid. Thank you. 
 Sebastian! 
 Aaaaaaahhhh! 
 You wanna see God? I'll show you God. 
! 
 Thought I'd... thought I'd save you for a change. 
 Nitro... 
 He said it himself... All they'll find is a pile of charred corpses. 
 He's rigged the centrifuge. 
 In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out the whole lab. 
 Grab on. 
 Forget about me. You go. 
 Fuck you. Give me your hands. 
 Climb! 
 But... 
 Climb! 
 I can't. I'm going to pass out. 
 Keep moving. 
 Oh God! 
 Don't look. 
 Move! 
 It's coming down! 
 C'mon. Before it slips. 
 Sebastian, you fuck. 
 Get off me. 
 No! 
 Let go of me. 
 Get off of her! 
 Go to hell. 
 What happened?

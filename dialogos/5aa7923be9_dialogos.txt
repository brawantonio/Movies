 P.O.V.: Tomething chases Young Edward through the dark forest. Its P.O.V. is skewed, inhuman. It is gaining on him. 
 P.O.V.: 
. 
 What's going on, Adams? 
 Twenty kids live at this orphanage, Sheriff. All twenty have gone missing. 
 After the power went out, I went to check on the children. But their beds were empty. Every one of them. They just disappeared... 
 Are you okay, son? Are the other kids around here? 
 I don't know... I don't remember... 
 Why don't we start with your name? Do you remember your name? 
 Edward... Edward Carnby. 
 Did you have a nightmare? 
 Your mother is wrong. Being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive. 
 Everybody else tells me not to be afraid. 
 That's because they don't know the truth. 
 (V.O.) So, maybe you're thinking I'm an asshole, trying to scare this poor kid for no reason. But that's where you're wrong. Because I've got my reasons. There's a world around you that you've trained yourself not to see. You've willfully closed your eyes. But your fear of the dark is not a weakness. It's there to protect you from things you'd better pray you never see. My eyes were forced open a long time ago. Now I know. Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it can't kill you. 
 You travel light. 
 Trust me, I'm carrying enough baggage for the both of us. 
 That's pretty funny, man. What do you do? 
 You really want to know? 
 Yeah, man. Hearing about my passengers' lives keeps the job interesting. 
 I'm a paranormal investigator. 
 Get the fuck outta here! 
 CABBIE (CONT'D) What does that mean exactly? 
 I'm an effective solution to unusual problems. 
 CARNBY (CONT'D) Speaking of which, that taxi's been following us since the airport. 
 No shit? Want me to lose him? 
 If you can... 
 I'm trapped, man! 
 I'll draw him away... 
 Hey! 
 Got another delivery, Ms. Cedrac. 
 I don't have anything scheduled. What museum was it transferred from? 
 For Dr. Hudgens, from Dr. Hudgens. 
 It's probably an error. It must be for the big Abkani show. 
 Abkani? What the hell's Abkani? 
 Ancient Native American civilization. They were this super-advanced culture, but something like ten thousand years ago, they just disappeared. 
 You've been reading up. 
 Not much else to do around here at night. 
 Says here it's not to be opened by anyone but Dr. Hudgens. 
 This is Aline Cedrac. She's the assistant curator. 
 We've got Abkani artifacts coming in from museums around the world. Until Hudgens gets back, I'm doing all the cataloguing anyway. 
 Where is Hudgens anyway? The show opens in a few days. 
 Off on another archeological goosechase. He thinks he's finally found the Erebus. 
 So he sticks you with the work. At least it keeps your mind off your boyfriend. 
 I'll be in my office if you need me. 
 What was that all about? 
 Damn it... I shouldn't have said that. Her boyfriend's been missing for the last three months. 
 Nice going, jack-ass. 
 They say a sunken ship is like a grave. It should never be disturbed. 
 I've been searching for the Erebus for twenty years, Captain. Now that I've found it, I'm afraid your ill-informed superstitions aren't enough to stop me. 
 Bring it up. 
 Don't you want to open it? Make sure it's what you're looking for? 
 The conditions must be perfect. Otherwise, there will be... consequences. 
 Is this made of solid gold? 
 Did you know the Abkani were the first civilization to use gold for their valuables? They believed it held the power to contain evil spirits. Thousands of years later, we don't even remember why gold was valuable to us in the first place. Now, let's load it onto the truck. 
 The pictograms are late-period Abkani. It seems to be some sort of... prophecy. Shadows that make ghosts of men. The world of light consumed by darkness. This is the first indication I've ever seen that the Abkani had a myth about the end of the world. 
 If the container's made of gold, whatever's inside must be worth a fortune. 
 You have no idea... 
 But I'm looking forward to finding out. 
 I suppose one should not be surprised when mercenaries act mercenary. 
 HUDGENS (CONT'D) You're making a terrible mistake. 
 The only mistake would be letting you walk out with whatever's in there. Barnes... 
 Captain! Don't open it! 
 Let's see what all the fuss is about... 
 John? 
 They're faster than I thought... 
 Kill him. 
 his better be good, Miles. 
 Sir, we're getting some strange readings in the control room. 
 his is Bureau 713. "Strange" doesn't even crack my radar. Now what's the situation? 
 Well, sir, normal levels of paranormal activity range from three to five... 
 condescending) Yes Miles. And what level are the sensors picking up now? 
 We don't know. 
 What are we looking at, Krashinsky? 
 Electromagnetics off the scale, Commander. 
 Recalibrating sensors now, sir. 
 Still having trouble sleeping, Edward? You can't stay up all night, you know. 
 Sister, something's happened. 
 What is it, Edward? 
 They're not gone anymore. The others are back. 
 (groggy) Hello? 
 Linda, what's wrong? 
 I'll figure this out, Linda. I'll find John. 
 Edward... you've known each other since you were kids. Did he... did he tell you he was leaving me? 
 Of course not. 
 Then where is he, Edward? What's going on? 
 Welcome home, Edward. 
 Should I make some tea? 
 Yes. Thank you, Sophie. 
 Sister... John disappeared last night. And something happened to me as well. 
 It's happening again. 
 I need your help, Sister. I need to find the others. 
 I'll get their files. 
 I'll let you know as soon as I hear something. 
 Why did I agree to this? 
 I ordered for you, Fischer. It's pecan. 
 You've got a good memory, Carnby. 
 FISCHER (CONT'D) I tracked down the three you asked about. They all disappeared last night. Same story. No suitcase. No car. Just up and walked out in the middle of the night. 
 That means all nineteen are missing. 
 I ran full cross-references. Nothing much in common between them. Except they all grew up in the same orphanage. Your orphanage. What's going on, Carnby? 
 That's what I'm trying to find out. 
 CARNBY (CONT'D) Thanks Fischer. It's good to know I've still got friends at 713. 
 Hello? 
 It's a fascinating piece, Dr. Hudgens. I started decoding the pictograms and... 
 I was only going to catalogue it for you. 
 But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just... 
 There's... somebody here to see you. 
 Edward... 
 I missed you too. 
 I thought you were dead, you asshole! 
 Aline... let me explain. In private. 
 Give me one reason why I'd ever want to speak to you again? 
 ALINE (CONT'D) It's Abkani... 
 Five minutes, Aline. I'll tell you everything. 
 I was in the Amazon for six weeks, tracking poachers through their transport lines. Then I fell in with a group of ex- Chilean military selling artifacts on the black-market. This was found in a gold mine in the southern tip of Chile. 
 And how did you end up with it? 
 I asked very nicely. 
 You should've called, Edward. Or written. Just to let me know you were alive. 
 Does it make any sense to you? 
 Yesterday, maybe not. But something happened last night. 
 They were found in completely different locations. Alaska. Newfoundland. Venezuela. And now this one's from Chile. 
 Ten thousand years ago, it would've been like burying them at the ends of the earth. 
 The Abkani's written language is based on pictograms. Combinations of symbols to create different meanings. But there's one here I've never seen before. 
 You're not trying to seduce me, are you? 
 Give me that. 
 What is it? 
 Hairs on the back of my neck just stood up. 
 How come every time you show up, my life gets complicated? 
 I could ask you the same thing. 
. 
 I think we'd better run... 
 Can't hold it... 
 CARNBY (CONT'D) Is there any way out of here? 
 No! Why didn't you ask me that before you pushed me in here? 
 ALINE (CONT'D) What do you think? 
 Those doors lead to the front entrance. 
 Reading two xenos. 
 There! 
 Cheung! Marko! Don't let them get away! 
 Readings gone. You lost them, Barr. 
 I want a full security sweep. Miles, get Fischer to send his sci-and-spy boys down here. Now go. 
 hat the hell are you doing here, Carnby? 
 Hey Richie. 
 It's Commander Burke. This is my unit. 
 They saved our lives. 
 You used to be able to take care of yourself, Carnby. Gotten soft since you left 713? 
 Ms. Cedrac, I'm Agent Miles. This is Commander Burke. 
 Aline Cedrac. Pleasure to meet you. How's the Ph.D. coming along? 
 It's fine. Thanks. 
 Miles, get her to a medic. 
 I'll catch up. 
 Why am I still looking at you? 
 I need to know what those things are. 
 That information's classified. If you were still an agent, you'd already know. But since you're not, stay out of my way. 
 I'm asking nicely. 
 Get him out of here! 
 You're right, Commander. I guess I have gone soft. 
 I want to finish studying those artifacts. 
 I need to find out what's happened to John and the others. Stay in contact. We'll meet up later. 
 Commander, I need to get to my office. 
 The museum's quarantined until we're done. 
 At least let me pack up my work. There's priceless artifacts in there. If they get damaged... 
 If you notice anything out of the ordinary, let me know immediately. 
 I don't think I want to know your definition of out of the ordinary. 
 You shouldn't be here, Carnby. 
 I'm not here. Commander Burke is. Now what the hell is that thing inside him? 
 Your curiosity have anything to do with the fingerprint of yours I found on his corpse? 
 The list of people I trust is short, Fischer. Is it about to get shorter? 
 CARNBY (CONT'D) Have you I-D'd him? 
 Yeah, we got dentals. Agent James Pinkerton. He's ex-713. 
 He was an agent? When? 
 Went MIA twenty years ago. Presumed dead. I'm trying to get more intell, but his records are so classified, they're practically invisible. C arnby takes the tongs from Fischer, holding open the skin. Fischer makes a series of incisions with the scalpel, disconnecting the spinal-worm from Pinkerton's spine. 
 It's fused with his nervous system. 
 I've never seen this kind of symbiosis before. 
 FISCHER (CONT'D) Scanner's still reading something... 
 (O.S.) The Abkani never cease to amaze me. 
 HUDGENS (CONT'D) Such a complex society at a time when most of humanity was still hunting and gathering and huddling around fires. 
 Dr. Hudgens. When did you get back? 
 A few hours ago. I heard there was some excitement. Are you alright? 
 I'm fine. A bit shaken up. But fine. 
 I apologize for snapping at you earlier. Now, what are you still doing here after all you've been through? 
 HUDGENS (CONT'D) Where did you get that image? 
 Edward. 
 This is a major find. I'll need to analyze it. Confirm its authenticity. 
 I can do that myself. 
 That wasn't a request... 
 HUDGENS (CONT'D) Where is the artifact? 
 (O.S.) Everything okay in here? 
 And you are? 
 Ms. Cedrac's security detail. 
 My dear, do you have any idea who I... 
 (interrupting) Dr. Lionel Hudgens. Former agent, sci-and- spy division. Currently 713 advisor status. I know exactly who you are. But I'm not your "dear" anything. 
 I'll just have to hold off my curiosity until morning. 
 Dr. Hudgens... I forgot to ask. Did you find the Erebus this time? 
 Just an empty shipwreck. You were right. It was another wild goosechase. 
 Since when do I have a security detail? 
 Since it seemed like you needed it. 
 There's one inside you too. But the symbiosis is incomplete. 
 Can you remove it? 
 I could try. But it might paralyze you. 
 What's missing... 
 I'm not much for coincidences. These organisms must be connected to those things from the museum. 
 We call them xenomorphs. 
 Catchy. When did they first appear? 
 Two years ago. They've been 713's top priority ever since. But it's been almost exclusively in rural areas. This kind of urban infiltration is unprecedented. 
 Have you isolated any weaknesses? 
 Most metals pass right through them. So normal bullets and blades are useless. But they're vulnerable to elements 76 to 79. Osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold. Negates their ability to disrupt electricity. 
 If they disrupt electricity, why did my flashlight still work? 
 The closer the current to its power source, the less disruption. 
 FISCHER (CONT'D) This is calibrated to track their disruption field. It won't help you see them, but you'll know when they're nearby. 
 FISCHER (CONT'D) They live almost exclusively in darkness. Sunlight's lethal in large doses. But only certain light frequencies hurt them. 
 ISCHER (CONT'D) These lamps are set to an effective frequency. 
 FISCHER (CONT'D) But for maximum damage, we use bullets coated in a photon-accelerated luminescent resin. Cuts right through them. 
 I'm going to need a lot of those. 
 Five minutes... 
 (O.S.) Fischer... 
 Edward? 
 ALINE (CONT'D) I see nothing's changed... 
 ALINE (CONT'D) Edward? 
 ALINE (CONT'D) Sweet dreams... 
 Have you been meeting with Carnby? 
 Yes. He's got intell we need. And I trust him. 
 We've got to trust each other, Fischer. Are you with us or not? 
 What do you need from me? 
 All the intell you've got on Edward Carnby. 
 What else could I do? I had to tell him. 
 You did the right thing, Paul. From what you've told me, Carnby can take care of himself. 
 Sarah? Answer me! Sarah! 
 If you can't beat us, Fischer, join us. 
 P.O.V.: 
 Something smells amazing. 
 ALINE (CONT'D) I love omelettes. 
 I know. 
 I figured out a connection with the symbols on those artifacts. They correspond to constellations. But something's missing. 
 Maybe this will help... 
 Can you run the program on this? 
 What are we looking for? 
 The Abkani used constellations to pin- point a geographical location. But I don't think I can isolate it closer than a hundred mile radius. 
 LINE (CONT'D) Edward... 
 Yeah. That's us right there. 
 John? 
 CARNBY (CONT'D) Behind you! 
 That looked like John. 
 It is. The other two are from the orphanage as well. 
 You had no choice. 
 Something's controlling them. 
 How many are there altogether? 
 Twenty. Including me. 
 P.O.V.: 
 CARNBY (CONT'D) We'd better get out of here. 
 Multiple readings confirmed. Back-up's on the way. 
 P.O.V.: 
 Aline! 
 P.O.V.: 
 We're clear, sir. 
 Love what you've done with the place, Carnby. 
 Sir, this one's infected too! 
 Got another one here! 
 Drop your weapon and get down on the ground. 
 What are you doing? 
 He's been infected with some kind of organism. He could be under its control. 
 It's true. I've got one inside me. But it's not controlling me. 
 You'll excuse me if I don't take your word for it. Now drop your weapon. 
 Get out of the way! 
 He's not one of them. 
 If I've got to shoot through you to get to him, I'll do it. 
 Why are the lights still out? 
 Scanner's clear. 
 Forget to pay your power bill, Carnby? 
 BURKE (CONT'D) You remember the number one rule they teach you in 713 training? Trust your instincts. 
 BURKE (CONT'D) Fischer's missing. So is Hudgens. And I've got a situation brewing that makes this scrap look like a bar brawl. 
 What does Hudgens have to do with this? 
 That's what I want to find out. I need you both to brief me in the air. 
 BURKE (CONT'D) Oh, and Carnby... I'll need my I-D back. 
 We're practically off the scale, Commander. This is unprecedented. Should I initiate Contingency Nine-Alpha? 
 Is that a negative, Commander? 
 We've got three perimeters of flash- mines. Gatling guns are set to electromagnetic motion tracking. And every available agent in the vicinity is here. But Commander... 
 I know, Miles. But back-up won't make it before sunrise. 
 Generator will be on-line shortly, sir. 
 It looks like you're going to war. 
 We are. The highest xeno concentration on record is closing in on this location. This could be our chance to wipe them out once and for all. 
 We need to go down there. 
 What? 
 They're coming here for a reason. Until we know what they're after, we're never really going to be able to stop them. 
 Something's definitely down there, sir. But there's too much interference to get a clear reading from here. 
 Goddamn it. Miles, you're in charge of perimeter defense. Nothing gets in or out until we find out what's down there. 
 I've been thinking about something. The Abkani prophecy. The shadows that make ghosts of men... 
 Every culture has a story about the end of the world. 
 But not every story starts to come true. 
 It's definitely this way, sir. 
 It's a dead end. 
 Readings are getting stronger. 
 We'll double-back. Take another tunnel. 
 Wait. Aline, look at this... 
 They're Abkani. 
 There's more over here. 
 What do you got, Marko? 
 We've got to get down there. 
 How long do we have to hold them? 
 Only until dawn. 
 Sir... that's four hours away. 
 I know. 
 Incoming! 
 Where the hell are the lights? 
 The generator's not coming on-line. They must be disrupting it. 
 Aline! 
 Cheung! Cut the line! 
 It's a warning. 
 Subtle. 
 The gist of it is, even if you make it down here alive, you're already dead. 
 Hold your fire until they're at the second perimeter. 
 Aline! 
 We've got to get up there. 
 Hit it. 
 We made it, sir. 
 Fischer? 
 BURKE (CONT'D) Goddamn it! 
 We'll find a way out. 
 CARNBY (CONT'D) It's just like the organism Fischer took out of Pinkerton. 
 Maybe this is what they look like when they grow outside a human host? 
 I think you'd better see this. 
 Feenstra! 
 The Abkani didn't put this here. 
 There's no way through. 
 There's always a way... 
 I'm out. 
 Last one. 
 I can't walk. If I lay down suppressing fire, maybe you can make it out of here. 
 I die fighting or I don't die at all. 
 You sure this is going to work? 
 What is this place? 
 This is where it happened. 
 
 Commander... 
 Edward, look... 
 So it's a key. 
 
 The pictograms carved here make it pretty clear that's a bad idea. 
 Two, we set enough C-4 to bury this place. Keep whatever's in there, down here for good. 
 The answers I've been looking for my whole life could be in there. 
 Some doors are locked for a reason. 
 Barr... how much C-4 you got left? 
 Enough to blow this place to... 
 I'm afraid I can't allow that. 
 HUDGENS (CONT'D) Now drop your weapons and back away. 
 
 Our early work was crude, I admit. But eventually we perfected the implant process. You were our last failure, Carnby. If you hadn't escaped, 713 never would've shut down the experiments. Burke's eyes flash with anger. 
 There's no way this was sanctioned. 
 Before your kind took over, 713 had very different... priorities. Now, you just blaze in and destroy everything before we can learn to control it. I've wasted twenty years working in secret because of short-sighted men like you. Hudgens sees the Abkani device Aline is holding. 
 HUDGENS (CONT'D) There it is... Aline's expression is firm, unafraid. She grips the device tightly. Hudgens is about to pull the trigger. 
 HUDGENS (CONT'D) You were a fine archeologist. 
 Aline... 
 CARNBY (CONT'D) Give him the key. Enough people have died today. 
 You couldn't have opened it anyway. Not without this... 
 HUDGENS (CONT'D) Insert the key. A line inserts the device into the opening in the door. 
 HUDGENS (CONT'D) Now turn it. 
 HUDGENS (CONT'D) When we found the first of them, 713 saw just another threat to be eliminated. But I knew it was something more. It was the first. The first to wake. I've woken others since then. But the rest are coming... 
 These doors won't hold them for long 
 Once we get out, we can remote detonate. 
 Look at the dust on the floor. This is where Hudgens got in. 
 Over there! 
 The remote detonator's inactive. The signal can't get through. 
 We'll find a way. 
 You saved my life, Carnby. I don't much like debts. 
 Burke! 
 Edward... if he detonates those charges, we're all dead. 
 They were under us the whole time. 
 Where are all the children? 
 Something's very wrong... 
 Edward... what's going on? 
 Remember what Hudgens said? I was his last failure. He said he perfected the implant process. 
 It can't be... 
 Then where the hell is everybody? Where's everybody gone? 
 CARNBY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Here's what I know. There are two worlds on this planet. A world of light and a world of darkness. For millions of years, these worlds were in balance. But now, the lights of human civilization burn everywhere. The dark places are disappearing. We forced them to come out of the shadows. Now, it's my job to force them back in. My name is Edward Carnby. I'm here to protect you from things you don't believe in. 
 CARNBY (CONT'D) Aline... 
 Yes Edward?

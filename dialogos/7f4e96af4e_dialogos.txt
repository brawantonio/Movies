 I can see you... 
 -- and we know from yesterday that the base of a triangle times half the height equals the area. 
 Yes, Mia? 
 Lucy's asleep again. 
 Let her sleep. 
 ANGELES - DAY 
 He would just go off, you know, start tearin' the place down. You didn't even know why he was doin' it half the time, you just got out of his way... 
 Yeah. Cuz I mean I don't want him to be like me. 
: 3. 
 (O.S.) One less Christmas card for Emily. 
 How many active cases you have? 
 Sorry, Em, we all are. 
. 
 DOUG'S VOICE Exhausted, her career path questionable, her faith in mankind shaken, she resisted her tendency toward introspection and went to have a drink with her friend Doug. 
 I am so in your head. 
 Regrettably, yes. 
 That you have a four-year degree and make seventeen grand a year after taxes? 
 Everybody's full of it. In the end you're a number to call for people who don't have anyone else. There's no way that's bad. 
 (HUGGING HER) Hey. So one of us is a major screwup, I can't remember if I was supposed to call you or the other way around...? 
 
 (HANDSHAKE) Hi. (then to Emily) Listen, my ride's leaving, let's catch up soon, okay? 
 So anyway, I've done some soul searching and I just want to say that if a full-on relationship feels like too much right now, I'd be willing to consider a purely physical one. 
 Hey, you might actually enjoy yourself. 
 I know, I know, the job, you get home you don't have anything left. 
 - 
 A WOMAN'S FACE 
 WOMAN'S VOICE What? 
 You said the seventeenth. 
 Is not. 
 Friday was the thirteenth. 
 Lucy. 
 Well he's not home so... 
 Not if I don't know where he is. 
 He doesn't have anything to say. 
 (O.S.) Edward! EDWARD! 
 (O.S.) That lady's here. From the state. She wants to talk to you. 
 (O.S.) I already told her, she wants to anyway. 
 Eddie says we don't have family problems. 
 Eddie says we don't need your help. 
 Eddie doesn't like speakin' out of anger. 
 No laws against being weird, Em. Send it over to CMC, we'll do a follow-up in a month. 
 Wait, did you just fly to New York and meet my parents? 
 Wanna know what I can feel? The lawsuit we're gonna get hit with if we violate her parents' rights without any evidence they've done something wrong. 
 Yeah, well, maybe because every time I make an emotional decision I get called by one. I'm sorry, you're gonna have to let this one go. 
 They really are God's miracles. Day she was born was the happiest day of our lives. We're not perfect parents, we know that, but we figure if you let `em know how much you love `em a lot of the other stuff takes care of itself. 
 (HOSTILE) Tell me, Mr Sheridan, since you've suddenly acquired the power of speech, doesn't it concern you a little that Lucy's grades have gone from A's to D's in three months? 
 Course it does, she's our daughter. 
 Bad dreams? 
 So they're overcompensating a little. 
 
 -- 
 They hate me. 
 They do. I hear them. They go in the cellar and talk. 
 Sending me to hell. 
 Did you hear your parents say they were going to hurt you? 
 I think you'd do just about anything you had to do to help a child you thought was at risk. Here are the facts, Emily. They haven't laid a finger on her that we can tell. And we have no proof they intend to. Meanwhile on your desk right now are thirty-plus cases of actionable abuse. What about those? 
 Yes, you are, you're leaving this alone. 
 
 (HURT) That's a little unfair, don't you think? I care about these kids as much as you do, but we can't go around yanking them out of their homes on a hunch. Parents, even bad ones, have rights, that's how the laws of this great land are written. 
 Was just thinking about you, got a nice letter from Sandy Hutchinson... 
 Well, it's sitting in front of me which means our good friend Wayne thinks it fails to meet the criteria for child endangerment and has told you in no uncertain terms to leave it alone...? 
 I can't, Emily. I'm sorry. 
 You know how dear to my heart the work you do is, but the department doesn't pay me to stakeout potential child abusers. Last time almost cost me my job. 
 Sickening as that is, you're a part of the system that handles those situations, I'm not. 
 Maybe you just need to let it work. 17. 
 Okay. No bullshit. Give me evidence of a crime, I'll be all over it. Till then there's nothing I can do. 
 A 
 If I disappear will you come look for me? 18. 
 If I do? 
 I have to go. They get mad when I miss the bus. 
: 
 Hey, this is Doug, here it comes - 
. 
 (V.O.) Emily...? 
 (V.O.) I'm scared... 
 (V.O.) They're waiting to get me, I can hear them... I'm sorry... 
 (V.O.) I'm falling asleep... 
 (V.O.) (softly; drifting off) I'm sooorry... 
 (FROM PHONE) Lucy...?! 20. 
. 
 What are we doing here? 
 They're asleep. 
 I didn't hear anything. 
 Police, open up! 
?! 
 The hell's the matter with you people?! 
 Prosecution asks that you disallow an insanity defense. This was an act committed with premeditation, malice 
 - 
 Your honor, the egregiousness of the crime makes the competency question all the more relevant. 
 Yes. I hereby order the defendants undergo psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental fitness for trial. 24. 
 Well, you're gonna hate me for saying this, but my money's on crazy. 
 It's not that simple sometimes. 
 When we brought them in that night they told Captain Lister... They think she's evil, some kind of demon spirit, minion of the devil or something. 
 (LAUGHS) Oh, that's great - what is this, late- night cable? 
 No, but that might be the world they're living in. 
 -- and what's the most important thing we talked about that you have to remember? 25. 
 It's not my fault what happened. 
 That's right and you know what? It's not. 
 That is some seriously proactive social work happenin' there. You all right? 
 Typical reaction, blames herself. We'll get there. I'm gonna put her in a group setting, see if I can get her to open up. 
 Doug said I might have to go to a state home. 
 Why can't I live with you? 
 Why? 26. 
 They were supposed to call you. We don't have any rooms. 
 There was a mixup with the dates. Sorry. 
 There's nowhere for me to go is there? 
 You don't have to be my mom. Just my friend. 
 This is highly irregular and I'll tell you right now it makes me very uncomfortable. But since, Wayne, you've spoken so persuasively on Miss Jennings's behalf... 
 (V.O.) ...I'm going to go against my better judgement and approve this petition for temporary custody. 
 Where's your family? 
 Why? 
 What's this? 
 You did. 
 I trust ya, Em, make sure you lock it on the way out.

 A 
 LUCY'S BEDROOM 
 Sometimes when our parents aren't getting along it's better if they don't see each other for a while, that's what a `restraining order' does... 
 She's starting to come out of her shell. It's good, I just wish I thought it was me making the difference. 
 Hatred and fear are part of the same pathology - oh, but I forgot, you don't think they're crazy. 
 I love you, Emily. 
 Wayne's looking for you. 
 #2 Wayne wants to -- 
 Why don't we talk in my office. 
 We don't know why yet, but... he killed his mother and father last night. 
 Sure you want to see this? 
 Gets a tire iron from the garage, comes back inside, locks all the doors and windows, kills them in their sleep... 
 Had to use dental records to identify the bodies. 
 I was there when they brought him in. Took three guys my size to subdue him. Kid was climbing the walls. 
 Just your average American family. 
 Juvie lockup. And, no, I'm not taking you to see him. 
 I know what happened. 
 Are they dead? 
 (SOBBING) I killed my mum and dad... 
 Every family you sit down with every day of every week is a family in crisis. Those are your odds. That's the job you do. Trying to beat them. 
 You're one person, Em. You can't save the world. (THEN) I know somebody you did save. 36. 
 You okay? 
 Why do you do it if it makes you sad? 
 I'm sorry... I wanted to know what happened to you. 
 Is that your mom? 
 (GESTURES `ADIOS') ...and I never knew when she was coming back, or if she was... I used to think it was my fault and I would try so hard when she got home to be good, do everything I could think of, so she'd think I was `special' and stay next time or take me with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd always go away again, that's how it was. 
 Where was your dad? 
 What'd you say to him? 
 Are you mad at me? 
 (SYMPATHETIC) I need another set of eyes to go over them, make sure we haven't missed anything else. 
 It's just a legal thing. You'll have them back tomorrow. 
 You watch, six months, their lawyer will hire some expert to say they're rehabbed and they'll sue for custody when they get out. 
 I didn't hear you say that. 
 We pulled the Martinezes' phone records. They got a call that night before the murders. 
 
 (SOBER PAUSE) Emily, the call came from your house. 
 Look, I'm not accusing you of anything, I just need to know what was said. 
 I'm talking to you as a friend here, you know that, right? 
 Then who did? Go find the guy who broke in and just happened to dial the number of a kid whose case you handle. 
 He's in my group... (puts down photo) ...why, did something happen? 
 We're trying to figure out why. He got a call Thursday night from this number. I'm just wondering if he might have said anything... 
 It wasn't me. 
 You didn't call him? 
 Lucy, it's hard sometimes to tell the truth, but I know you will because you're a good little girl. 
 I am telling the truth. 
 It wasn't me, I swear. 
 The call was at 2 am, are you ever up that late? 
 I didn't call him. 
 Are you ever up that late? 
 Yeah, maybe so. Night, Lucy. 
 She's lying. 
 Do you believe me? 42. 
 Copy of the Sheridans' psych evals for the file. And the cognitive profile Lucy did for me the other day. 
 Normal. 43. 
 You have to beg. 
 (SAME BREATH) Coming from an environment like that, testing this normal is a bit abnormal, if that makes any sense. 
 I think she faked it, gave the answers she thought she should. 
 
 (SHRUGS) She's ashamed of who she is. Ashamed of how she feels. Afraid nobody would want her if they saw the real her. (off Emily's reaction) It's no big deal, it just means I might have to push her a little. 
 Did you ask her about it? 
 What do you think? 
 Hmm. Bring her in after work, I'll do a one-on-one. I wanted to talk to her about this anyway. 44. 
 He asked to see you before you left. 
 El dijo... 
 Era un hombre. 
 Do... 
 (TURNS) you... 
 (TURNS) like... 
 (TURNS) working... 
 (TURNS) here? 
 Knock, knock. Sorry I'm late, guys. (TO LUCY) Ready, kiddo? 
 Go ahead down, I'll be right there. 
 (TO EMILY) You all right? 
 So how's school? 
 Fine. 
 Any of your classmates giving you a hard time? 
 No, they've been nice. 
 Sleeping okay? 
 That's not really what you want to talk about, is it, Doug? 
 You got me. 
 Question 16a, are you afraid of the dark? You answered `no'. Question 16b, are you afraid of being alone? `No'. 16c, are afraid of your parents? `No'. You answered `no' to everything in that section. I think some of those should have been yesses. Everybody is afraid of something. Working through our fears, conquering them, is how we get better. So I want you to tell me... What scares you? 
 I'll tell you what scares me if you tell me what scares you. 
 Fair enough. When I was twelve I was climbing a tree and I accidentally put my hand through a giant hornets' nest. They didn't like it. I got stung over a hundred times. They had to rush me to the hospital. I've been afraid of hornets ever since. Don't climb many trees either. 
 (SMILES) Everybody has fears. Now, what scares you? 
 Me. 
 You scare yourself? 
 Sometimes. 
 Why, what about yourself scares you? 
 I have bad thoughts. 
 About what? 
 People. 
 People in general or certain people? 
 Certain people. 
 Like who? 
 You. 49. 
 You have bad thoughts about me? 
 (SHE NODS) Why? 
 
 (SHRUGS) I just do. 
 Was there something I said or did that upset you? 
 (shakes her head) It's just the way you are... 
 How am I? 
 Facile. 
 Facile? (she nods yes) Do you even know what that means? 
 Easily comprehended. Often lacking sincerity or depth. You're smug, too. Want me to tell you what that means? 
 Well, if, um, if I seemed `smug' or `facile' I want to - 
 
 (GIRLISH LAUGH) Don't apologize. 
 Why? 
 You're a grown up, it's embarrassing. 
 (THEN; DEADPAN) (MORE) 50. 
 LUCY(CONT'D) Should we talk about school now? My grades are getting a lot better. 
 Talked to a lot of ten-year-olds, I don't think I've ever felt like that before... 
 Threatened. (THEN; BAFFLED) I know a specialist, I'll call him in the morning. 
 Don't let her get in your head. 
 Are you mad at me? 
 Want me to brush your hair? 
 Are you sure? 
 (STANDS UP) It will make you feel better. I'll get the brush. 
 Doug said something, didn't he? 
 What did he tell you? 
 You're funny. 
: 
 You forgot to kiss me goodnight. 
 I love you. 
 Hello? 
 Hello...? 
 Try again, sorry. 
 
 
! 
 - 
 Seen Doug? He had an appointment with one of my kids this morning, never showed up. 
 All I get is voicemail. 
 Hey, this is Doug, here it comes - 
!!!!! 
 (trying to remember) Winters -- oh, right, Douglas. 
 Family? 
 Compression fracture of the third and forth vertebrae. Severed his spinal cord. Actual cause of death was... suffocation. 
 It appears all his injuries were self- inflicted, yes. 
 Miss, I would never presume to know your friend better than you. But the injuries suggest he was trying to hurt himself. Unfortunately, he succeeded. I am sorry. 
 Truly, I am shocked every day by the violence people do to themselves. 
 You think it's my fault, don't you? 
 Listen. You're still in shock. Let's NOT -- 
 Look, I don't know, all I'm saying is a kid in his state of mind maybe isn't the most reliable witness. 
 Emily. I already did. There were no calls from your house. 
 A 
 And by forcing your daughter into the oven, can you tell me, what did you think the outcome would be? 
 You mean what were we doing it for? 
 Yes. 60. 
 To kill her. 
 Why? 
 God's will. 
 And why was it God's will that you should kill your daughter? 
 Why is that funny, Margaret? 
 `Cause she's not my daughter. 
 You're her mother...? 
 I bore her, but she's not mine. 
 Help me understand. If you and Edward are Lucy's biological parents, how can she not be yours? 
 `Cause she's not Of us. 
 Not Of you? 
 Who is she Of? 
 Not who, what. 
 What is she Of? 61. 
 Stop acting like you don't know what I'm talking about. 
 You think your daughter is the devil? 
 Not him himself, Of him, working in his name, in his honor. 
 Evil incarnate? 
 I don't care what you call it. 
 And why do you think that? 
 Not what I think it's what I know. 
 How do you know this? Could you give me an example? 
 She can make you see things. Visions. 
 Visions of what? 
 Hell. Damnation. Whatever you're afraid of. 
 I see. Any other `special abilities'? 
 People die around her, is that a special ability? 
 She kills people? 62. 
 Not by her hand, they just die. I had two brothers, Brent and Travis... 
 ...and I mean they was healthy boys, healthy as can be. Eddie, three sisters. Soon as she was born they started dying. 
 You blame Lucy for their deaths? 
 Why do you imagine you were spared? 
 I guess she couldn't get rid of us till she found somebody else. Now that she has, I don't imagine we're long for this world. 
 THE HELL DID I JUST SAY?! 
 Edward, please calm -- 
 YOU AND YOUR GODDAMN QUESTIONS! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! 
 IT'S NOT CHILD KILLING IF SHE'S NOT A 
! 63. 
 (V.O.) Unfortunately Mrs Sheridan suffered a rather severe psychotic episode last night... 
 ...Woke up screaming, absolutely convinced she was on fire. She wasn't, of course, they managed to sedate her. But it's curious, she displays all the symptoms of a burn patient. Except the burns themselves... 
 In no condition for visitors as you can see. If you'd like, I could let you see Mr Sheridan? 
 Who died? 
 You're scared. 
 You oughta be. 
 You judged us before you ever walked in that house. Sat there in our living room tellin' us about our problems, how to be better parents - certain of everything and dead wrong about all of it. (THEN) Ask what you came to ask. 
 Can tell you what she's not. She not a daughter of mine. She's not a ten-year- old having trouble in school. She's not some innocent victim whose door you busted down and life you saved. And she's not going no place, lady, till she's good and done with you. 
 However she wants. You think it's an accident her ending up with you? She saw you coming a mile away. 
 You have that you're good. Kindness. Decency. That's what she feeds on. Bleeds ya dry, moves onto the next. We were a big family, she went through us like a wrecking ball. And you know, every time something happened, every time, we had an excuse for why it wasn't her fault. Cuz it's easier to lie to yourself than think bad things about your baby girl. But finally we got to a point where me and Maggy looked at each other - (remembers so clearly) - where we looked at each other and we was out of lies, both of us. Most terrifying moment of our lives. And that's where you are now. 
 I'll tell you this. She sees everything. And what she doesn't see she just sort of senses it, like when you call a friend and they pick up before it rings? (MORE) 66. 
 EDWARD(CONT'D) Only time you got the upper hand is when she's sleepin' but she almost never does. We checked on her every night for three months. Every twenty minutes, up and down those stairs. First time she slept was the night you kicked in my front door. 
 To know... what your idea of hell is... and make you live there. 
 I'm not a hateful man. I look at you and I wish I could tell you you're through the worst of it. That it's gonna work out for you in the end. I wish I could. 
 How strong's your faith? 
 Emily, I heard about Doug. I'm so sorry. 
 (NODS) Do you have a minute? 
 How's it working out with the Sheridan girl? 
 She is. You're it. 
 Playing mommy isn't the laugh-a-minute you were hoping, huh? 
 Sorry, you petitioned for custody, you got it. She's your responsibility. 
 Till we find a suitable foster home. 
 You're asking me questions you know the answer to. Three to six weeks. Surely you can manage that long. 
 Now you look. I put my reputation, quite possibly my career, on the line for you. Don't embarrass me. You make this work. 68. 
 However! Find a way! 
 That what you're looking for? 
 (NODS) Thanks. 
 A 
 
 Hi. 
 You weren't there so I took the bus. 
 It's okay, I know how busy you are. 
 Doesn't matter anyway, the bus stops right at the end of the street. So I can always get home, whether you're there or not. 70. 
 Where's the phone? 
 Wow. That one, too. 
 Can I have a shower? We had gym today... 
 Are they being nice to her? 
 My mother. 
 I thought you said you were going to see her. 
 Hm. I must have dreamt it. 
 
 Good night. 72. 
 Emily...? 
 You wanna end up where they did keep talking like this. (off her look) I'm not judging you. You're grieving for Doug and you're still confused about what Diego did. 
 Diego grew up in a bad home, he saw violence and he repeated it, that's the cycle, you know that better than anyone. 73. 
 `Cause she's a liar, that doesn't mean she made him do it. Look, let me tell you what Lucy is. Lucy is a damaged child, a deceitful child, a manipulative child. But a damaged, deceitful, manipulative child is not a demon. Ask my brother-in-law, he's got a couple of `em. 
 I stopped you on the steps. I think maybe you oughta go all the way in. 
 Who do you think you are barging in there like that?! 
 Well that's not your decision, is it?! 
 It's okay, Nancy, Emily's been under a lot of stress lately, but she's really nice to me and I hope I can stay with her a really long time. 
 We'll talk about this later. 
 See you next week, Nancy. 
 Why, Emily? 75. 
 Why, Emily? Why, Emily? Why, Emily? 
 Why, Emily? Why, Emily? 
 Can I go back to group next week? 
 Are you sure? 
. 
 
 I can see you. 77. 
 Don't be sad. This is your new beginning. 
 Um, so, I notice you haven't taken any personal days. Come on, you look like crap, go home. 
 Emily... 
 Sure, when? 
 Em, any other weekend you know I'd say yes, but I just met this guy and he's coming over tonight like for the night and it might be, you know, kinda weird. 
 (O.S.) Emily...? Can I come in? I'm scared... 
 (O.S.) Emily? Please? I know you're in there, please...? 
 (O.S.) Please, Emily... 
. 
 (O.S.) LET ME IN! 
 (O.S.) LET ME IN! 
 (O.S.) Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in... 80. 
 
 There's nobody out there. 82. 
! 
 There - is - nobody - out - there! 
 (re: the office space) No, I like it. It's like those things they put baby cows in to make veal - 
 What? 
 Em...? 
 Emily...? 
 Jesus - are you okay? 
 (HOARSE WHISPER) I... I had some things to catch up on... 
 You look like shit, you need to see a doctor. 
 What did they say? 
 What are you doing here so late? I tried calling you. I found someone to take Lucy. 
 (STUNNED RELIEF) You did? 
 Anaheim couple. They've helped us out before. 
 What's the matter? 
 
 (NODS YUP) She starts all over again somewhere else. Can't let her stay, can't let her go. That leaves you with one option. 
 You have to. You have to find the strength. Don't you understand? That's why she's doing this. To test you. Test your faith. 
 How `bout anger. Got some of that? 
 Kill her? In her sleep, assuming you can... (THEN; THINKING) Tell you what I'd do different. Count myself dead at the outset. Accept that going in and use it to my advantage. That's the one thing I don't think she'd see coming, someone giving up their own life to take hers. 
 Where is she now? Some family somewhere? 
 Why does that concern you, Edward? 
 `Cause you have to warn them. 
 I like it here. I like you. You want me to like you, don't you? 
 You have to do what I say. If I say I want to go to group, you have to do it. If I say I want a new dress, you have to do it. If I say I want ice cream every day after school, you have to do it. Okay? 
 They did what I said for a while and then they stopped and started with the secrets. But they weren't really secrets I guess... (looks at Emily) ...because I always knew what they were thinking. 
 Don't leave me. 
 It's okay, Maggie. I'll check on you later. 
: 
 LUCY'S VOICE I'm happy you're getting the help you need, daddy. 
 I know... 
 There's something I want you to hear. Came in at two o'clock last night. You might wanna sit. 
: 
 You're right. She called Doug. Took me an extra couple of days to get your cell phone records. That's what she's been using. 
: 
 I'm gonna help you get to the bottom of this. 
 I'll help you. 
 Whatever it takes. 
 I'm gonna put Beth and Tim in a hotel. Keep her at the house. 
 Physically you're fine. How's the stress? 
 Take one of these, you'll sleep. 
 BARRON'S WIFE Why won't you tell me what's going on? 
 Because I can't. 
 Take care of your mom. 
! 
 BZZZZZZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZZZZZZZT. 
 
 
 BZZZZZZZZZZZZZT! BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZT! 
 
 
 "INCOMING CALL..." 
 (V.O.) They don't know if he fell or what happened... 
 (V.O.) Emily? Emily, are you okay...? 
 
 He did it to himself. 
 Europa. Ganymede. Io. Callisto. The moons of Jupiter. We got back our astronomy tests today. 
 Don't yell at me. My mom and dad used to yell at me. 
 (O.S.) Emily... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to... 
 (O.S.) Can I come in so we can talk and work it out? 
 (O.S.) Emily...? 
 (O.S.) Don't be mad. I said I was sorry. I'll brush your hair for you. 
. 
 
 (PLAYING MOMMY) What are you doing, you silly pumpkinhead? 
 
 (PLAYING MOMMY) You don't want me to come under there and get you, do you? 
 
 (PLAYING MOMMY) I'm going to count to three. One... 
 
 (PLAYING MOMMY) Two... Two and a half... 
 
 (PLAYING MOMMY) Two and three quarters... Three... 
 Here I come. 
 What you wanted from your mother. I want you to love me. 
: 
 Come tuck me in. 
 You better come. 
 Chamomile. 
 Maybe you should have it, you look stressed. 
 I'll be good. 
 Say it. 
 Forever and ever? 
 Where are you if I need you? 
 
 Everybody get out okay?! 
 This your house?! (she nods yes) Anybody else inside?! (off her hesitation) Ma'am...?! 
 
 Anyone else inside?! Yes or no?! 
 That was mean. 
 Maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming pool. 
 It's sad, isn't it? How it gets passed on. How people do to their own kids what their parents did to them. That's why you got the job... 
 ...To prove to yourself you're not like her, that you're not like your mother. Because that scares you. Scares you more than anything. 
 I love you... even if you don't love me. 
 What are you doing? Slow down. 
 Did you hear me? 
 I said slow down! 
 Please, stop, Emily, I'll be good. 
 Look out! 
 What are you doing?! 
 Yes, it is! 
 
! 
 
 Right through the guardrail, never touched the brakes... 
 Don't look at her, okay? Just don't even look. 
 A remarkable story of survival this morning as a young girl is pulled from the Los Angeles reservoir in an accident police are calling suspicious... 110. 
 Set. 
 Why can't I live with you? 
 Oh, darling, we're not foster parents, we just help out when the system's full. 111. 
 They'll contact us, Lucy, when your placement comes through. 
 Some nice family that always wanted a little girl. 
 Going to the thing Saturday? 
 I don't know. 
 Oh, you should. It'll be fun. 
 Maybe I will, I don't know. We'll see. 
 Bye, Janey. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 SHERIDAN, LUCY.

 (whispering) Showtime! 
 PEEPER (CONT'D) Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy? (takes bite of sandwich) Well you'll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into some sweats. 
 PEEPER (CONT'D) Oh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me rub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't use my hands.  Heh heh heh heh... 
 PEEPER (CONT'D) Looks like Victoria just told me her secret. 
 PEEPER (CONT'D) Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m., first brassiere sighting... (stops writing) I will pleasure myself to this image for months.  MONTHS I TELL YOU! 
 PEEPER (CONT'D) Young Scottie Dunleavy.  What unfortunate timing.  You mother was just getting comfy. 
 PEEPER (CONT'D) Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great knots today or whatever.  Now get out. 
 PEEPER (CONT'D) Now what.  This simply won't do. 
 Hello? 
 Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up. 
 Who is this? 
 Just a little birdie.  A birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra. 
 Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up our tree? 
 Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big bird. 
 PEEPER (CONT'D) Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And wear your bikini. 
 PEEPER'S POV 
. 
 (O.S.) Welcome! 
 Am I in hell? 
 What do you think? 
 I knew it.  He's finally retiring. 
 Aaaah! 
 If the old man picks me to take over Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty four seven.  No breaks. 
 Aaaaaaaaaaaah! 
 I'll take that. 
 Was that really necessary? 
 Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing today? 
 Hey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle? 
 Got ya! 
 Got ya, again! 
 Got ya!  Now here's the big finish... 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Aaaaah. 
 What are you boys doing? 
 Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind? 
 I forgot. 
 Maybe this will help you remember. 
 DAD (CONT'D) Now everybody sit down. 
 Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later. 
 DAD (CONT'D) My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules here in hell for ten thousand years. And after this ten thousand years had passed, he decided to abdicate his throne... 
 DAD (CONT'D) ...to step aside. (Nicky lowers his hand) ...and let me become the ruler of hell. This, as some of you might know, is my ten thousandth year as Prince of Darkness.  So I think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me. 
 Yes, Jimmy. 
 DAD (CONT'D) No, no, that's not what I said.  He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go. 
 This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons.  I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And Nicky, so...so... 
 Such a sweet boy.  But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be...me. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) I mean...tough break. 
 The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil.  And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time. 
 Dad!  This is Hoyashit. 
 Right.  Right.  Send him in. (to the boys) I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back to work. 
 I'm telling you, pal, it's the right thing to do. 
 Holy schnit!! 
 You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that. 
 It's just such a slap in the face. 
 Yeah, get out of here!  Beat it! 
 Oh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it on!! Let's see what you got! 
 CASSIUS (CONT'D) That's what I thought! 
 I am concentrating.  Where can we rule? 
 ADRIAN (CONT'D) We could create our own hell there. 
 You saying we go up there and kill everyone? 
 ...their damned souls will be ours. 
 Hey, what are you doing?!? 
 GATEKEEPER (CONT'D) You can't go through there.  The fire flows in, not out. 
 GATEKEEPER (CONT'D) You know something?  You guys suck!  You really suck! 
 Now that was an experience.  "You are only coming through in waves."  That line blows my mind every time. 
 I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song.  When it's over, that mood has been altered.  Wow. Great shit.  What's next? 
 Who is this, Metal-lick-a? 
 I was just playing with you. 
 I'm sorry.  After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline. 
 C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring. 
 In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino. 
 You did it for Namath. 
 Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that. 
 This is bullshit, man. (gets up to leave) I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you! 
 Now you're talking. 
 And I also happen to be a Jets fan. 
 Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have escaped from hell.  They went through the fire, and they broke it.  I think they took the New York tunnel.  I tried to stop them, but they overpowered me, sir. 
 Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off your knees. 
 Thanks for being so understanding, your worship.  You're the man.  You've always been the man. 
 GATEKEEPER (CONT'D) (to Nicky) I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right? 
 That's what I'm thinkin'... 
 This is bad, Nicky. 
 I'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing. 
 What's with all the whoo-whoo noises? 
 Everything's fine, pop. 
 Last time you said that the renaissance happened. 
 Please, pop, just go back to your room. 
 (regarding gateskeeper) Can I take him with me and have sex with his head? 
 Sure, pop.  Whatever you want. 
 Oh, this is gonna be a whole new lifestyle for me, isn't it. 
 (O.S.) What's going on?  Where are we? 
 To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way. 
 I'm too weak.  The process has already begun. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) I've never been to Earth.  I've never even slept over at some other dude's house! 
 Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here. 
 Here.  Get them drunk from this.  One sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once you've got both of them, you bring the flask back through the gate. 
 Son, just do your best. 
! 
 That's a train, son.  Don't stand in front of them. 
 Please, Nicky, get back up there. (his ear falls off) Try to hurry. 
 (voice of Sandy Wernick) Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track and come with me, shitstains. 
 My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of your father's.  He's asked me to help you out. 
 It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers can possess people.  So they probably won't look like themselves.  You have to be suspicious of everyone. 
 It's not me, moron. 
 Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his children. (passerby puts in money) He thanks you for your kindness. (another woman puts in money) God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you... The Lord loves you... 
 PREACHER (CONT'D) The Lord does not love you.  I sense...pure evil. (thrusts his cross in Nicky's face) You make the Lord very nervous. (feeling hot) I'm burning...ahhh. (running away) The Devil walks among us! 
 PREACHER (CONT'D) Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast! 
 Makin' friends already. 
 You're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has.  We'll stop by K-mart.  Get you some warm clothes. 
 That pain is hunger. 
 Put it in your mouth. 
 BEEFY (CONT'D) Move your teeth up and down. 
 BEEFY (CONT'D) Now you gotta swallow it.  Tilt your head back and let the meat slide down your throat-hole. 
 It sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're gonna need your energy. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks. 
 You got it.  Could you maybe not tell anyone about this? 
 Great.  Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side.  But I misplaced it. 
 So I found this other joint for you. But you're gonna have a roommate. 
 (on phone) I know exactly how you feel... The night Reagan was elected, I said to my mother, "Is this man going to blow up the world, Mommy?"  Then we both cried for like an hour. (knock at the door) Somebody's here.  Call you later. 
 Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is? 
 Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits. 
 Right.  And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. (looks at Nicky) Aren't you boiling in that outfit? 
 It's like eighty degrees in this hallway.  You from the South? 
 Why is that funny? 
 And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed. 
 You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about. 
 Yeah, your bedroom is right over there. 
 In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven... or something like that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat. 
 CARDINAL (CONT'D) Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really done anything for us?  Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes?  No. He hasn't done a damn thing for any of us. 
 Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me, he was better off on drugs.  He's a bore.  At least when he was smoking hashish, he made me laugh occasionally. 
 After we tried for many years, the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby. 
 No, your best friend Fitzie helped your wife conceive a baby.  He helped her conceive it all night long. 
 CARDINAL (CONT'D) How about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever do anything for you? 
 (standing) Well, I wish I could think of something, Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if there even is a Lord.  If there is any ultimate punishment for our so-called "sins."  Maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want. 
 Amen to that.  Let the sin begin! 
 
 (O.S.) (laughing) "Let the sin begins" - that was a good one. 
 (O.S.) I lowered the drinking age to ten. 
 (O.S.) Why should it end?  Who's gonna stop us? 
 Look, it's okay for me to shit the street.  But you gotta use a toilet. 
 Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Get in the bottle.  Dad's falling apart. You froze the gate and you're killing him.  Drink! 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Adrian and Cassius!  You think a kick to the head is gonna make me throw in the towel?  Well, in the immortal words of Judas Priest, "You got another thing comin'." 
 Bus? 
 (to Monster) You like that?  You think that's funny? 
 GATEKEEPER (CONT'D) How about that?  You like that? 
 I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects.  Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown. 
 BEEFY (CONT'D) Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just begging to come out... 
 Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time. 
 'Bout time... 
 JOHN (CONT'D) There's our man. 
 Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side. 
 What's with that guy? 
 Gotta be one of his disciples or something. 
 Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off. 
 Should we wake him up? 
 Yeah.  You do it. 
. 
 Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude just stole your shit. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Which way did he go? 
 That way. 
 Did you check out the dragon mouth? 
 The Dark Prince is here. 
 See something you like, my man? 
 You callin' me a thief, my man? 
 And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief? 
 Yeah, how much for the silver flask there? 
 Well, that's a very special item.  The cap itself is one hundred percent plappium.  It's a value is over three thousand dollars. 
 Really.  Where's it from? 
 Really.  I think we'll let you keep it then. 
 Okay, now you gone and done it.  You done messed with my business bitch! 
 Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me? I'll show you some crazy eyes.  Let's get busy. 
 Excuse me, does that flask belong to this man? 
 (frustrated) Now you callin' me a thief?  Damn. 
 Look, I know you come out here and sell stolen stuff all the time.  But today, the guy you stole from just happened to walk by and bust you.  So why don't you admit today's not your day and give him his flask back? 
 Or what're you gonna do about it?  Ugly me to death? 
 No, but maybe that cop over there might have something to say. 
 Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy. (looking at Valerie) And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes and find a new corner.  Before I show you what real crazy is. 
 Fine.  I will. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) That was amazing.  Thanks so much.  You didn't have to do that. 
 That's okay.  I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it.  I hate when people take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it for the rest of us. 
 I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent maybe.  Where are you from? 
 Really? 
 Why are you laughing? 
 My dad's an optometrist. 
 I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your parents get older. 
 Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out. 
 That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati. 
 If you want to. 
 "Octopus people?" 
 It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap it. 
 Why do you taunt me with your darkness?! Your evil is stinking up our streets! We're all gonna die! 
 This town is really going to hell lately. (Nicky nods) So what part of the city do you live in? 
 (laughs) You have a dog?  What kind? 
 Remember, it's not the size of the boat, it's the motion of the ocean. 
 Just finish. 
 I'd love to have a dog.  But I go to school full time.  It wouldn't be fair to the dog. 
 Parsons School of Design.  I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty. 
 My perfume? 
 VALERIE (CONT'D) (laughs) It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Which I think is the French word for coconuts. 
 Sometimes, sure. 
 Doesn't sound very good behind there.  I hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth. 
 You know, I was the one who created Hell. 
 I know, your wickedness. 
 I started slow, though.  For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration.  She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex.  I said I'll take the soup. 
 LUCIFER (CONT'D) Take it easy there, Chewbacca.  In fact, you look like her mother, except she had more hair. 
 LUCIFER (CONT'D) You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius? 
 It's Stanley, sir. 
 Nothing.  No mountains.  No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot.  It wasn't even called Hell. 
 What was it called, sir. 
 Boogerland! 
 That's nice, Grandpa.  Why don't you just enjoy the fishing? 
 I can't enjoy anything.  I go fishing. I catch nothing.  I go to orgies, I catch everything... 
 I deserve this! 
 I just stole twenty-five bucks off the bar. 
 #2 How many beers did you have? 
 # 3 Eight sips. 
 I had five!  I'm so wasted. 
 Basically, yeah. 
 You know what's nice about you?  You just seem happy being yourself.  You don't try to act cool. 
 What? 
 What was that? 
 NICKY (CONT'D) ...I've always wanted to have sex with a gross pig.  What do you say we go behind that dumpster, pull our pants down and see what happens? 
 You're a jerk. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Hey, Valerie! 
 What the hell's your problem? 
 Check this out.  The number of the beast. 
 Reverberations from Arch-Decon Donnelly's shocking speech are still being felt throughout the city.  Today, some disgruntled cast members of the play CATS broke the fourth wall in a most hostile manner. 
 
 ...But even that does not come close to what happened today on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee. 
 
 So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off... 
 Oh, that's terrible, Reege... 
 So I followed him... 
 You followed him? 
 I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat. 
 You keep a bat under your seat? 
 Recently, yes!  So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy!  Did you ever see THE 
? 
 Yes, great movie... 
 I was DeNiro! 
 Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil. 
 You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers. 
 Go get a soda out of the fridge. 
 (high-pitched mocking) "But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make? 
 BEEFY (CONT'D) You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid - engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss.  You just have to release the evil within you. 
 I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores. 
 BEEFY (CONT'D) Release your evil... 
 What are you doing? 
 TODD (CONT'D) I know it's your living room night.  But can I finish watching the Globetrotters' game out here?  To me it's classic Comedia Dellarte. 
 
 What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse 85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal run circles around the 0-85 Nationals, seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their hometown fans. 
 He's walking, get him a bus! 
 Oh, another awful call.  There is no way that was travelling. 
 What's with all these crazy calls?  You gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a game in 53 years. 
 Technical foul! 
 
 NICKY (CONT'D) It looks like the work of a brother... 
 A black guy? 
 Get your head out your ass, ref!  The kids came to see the Globetrotters win. 
 Oh, so you wanna lip off to me? Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten points off for the Globetrotters. 
 
 
 In all my years of basketball, I was never so happy to hear a halftime buzzer.  Folk, I'm afraid if the second half doesn't get any better, I expect a full scale riot. 
 It's time for the Globetrotter's halftime half-court heave throw, where one lucky fan will have a shot at ten thousand dollars! 
 I ain't goin' out there and taking the shot.  These people have gone crazy. 
 Look who's back from the dead. 
 Six, six, six, pick up sticks. 
 What's Nicky doing down there? 
 Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth. 
 Did you just talk? 
 No. 
 You better win these people some free pizza.  Looks like they're about to start killing each other. 
 
 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Okay, too much evil.. 
 I think that ball just blew up.  And yes, my hair is aflame. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) I command you not to blow up and go into that metal circle. 
 Get that crap outta here! 
 (O.S.) Look around you, Nicky.  We're in Hell. The New Hell. 
 
 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Alright, how about this?  I get one more shot.  The ref will cover me.  I miss it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game. I make it, he doesn't ref the second half and we all start conducting ourselves like decent human beings again. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) And we get free pizza. 
 I think it's safe to say we're all rooting for this bizarre and hideous looking man. 
 Nicky!  Nicky!  Nicky! 
 
 
 I heard.  I'm glad he's dying.  It's my turn now. 
 Take him to the hole, Nicky. (Todd stares) I mean, woof!  Woof! 
 Damn, I gotta learn how to do that. 
 MID-COURT 
 That's nuts.  When'd you learn that shit? 
 Super devil juice?  Give it over.  Let's go best two out of three. 
 
 
 (O.S.) Damn you, Nicky!  There ain't no super devil juice in here! 
 So your father's the devil, you're a talking dog sent from Hell, and you guys are who? 
 Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and the work his Dad does. 
 By the way, Nicky.  Check this out. 
 JOHN (CONT'D) What's Ozzy trying to say there? 
 I command you in the name of the Lucifer to spread the blood of the innocent. 
 No wonder your uncle's so weird... 
 I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny. 
 Oh, I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the mix.  Tried to spice up the bash. 
 Come on.  One more time. 
 Please.  You got to. 
 I used to get baked like this with my first girlfriend, Heather.  We'd get so stoned she would forget I was a dog. 
 She was human? 
 Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man, that pissed my parents off. 
 I dated a Japanese girl once.  My parents disapproved.  Not cause she's Japanese, but cause she was only fifteen. 
 I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough.  And she needed that. 
 By she, do you mean he? 
 No. 
 Busted. (laughs) 
 How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul Jabar? 
 Why?  Did she hurt you?  Do you miss her?  Need a shoulder to cry on? 
 Easy, Liberace. 
 Oh, would you grow up. 
 Maybe you love her.  But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind. 
 Me, too.  We're gonna get going. 
 You guys want to stay?  I have a futon in my bedroom. 
 That's a big pass, Elton John. 
 We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now.  Wanna come, Nicky? 
 Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then.  Later on. 
 (O.S.) You better snap out of it soon, kid. Cause we're going after Adrian tomorrow. Seven AM.  Nighty, night. 
 That is the most frightening thing I have ever seen. 
 Hello. 
 It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific."  Makes me feel like a hula girl.  Which is kinda what I'm going for.  Wanna come in? 
 Valerie Doran?  Two floors up, one window over. 
 I don't need luck.  I'm good. 
 Andrew. 
 Nicky?  Oh my G-d.  Stay right there. 
 What were you thinking coming here? 
 Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry! 
 VALERIE (CONT'D) Nicky? 
 Are you dead? 
 What are you doing? 
 Why would you be floating? 
 Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now?  Because I am. 
 You got the wrong window again, man. 
 I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left. 
 VALERIE (CONT'D) Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger. 
 What do you mean, "possessed?" 
 Yes... 
 ... "The Devil?"... 
 Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke. 
 VALERIE (CONT'D) I don't know if I should believe you. 
 Okay, I do.  Get back up here. 
 This is amazing. 
 The hellbeast is above us.  He's invading our skies!  We're all gonna die!  We're all gonna die! 
 He's kind of ruining the mood. 
 We're all gonna die! 
 Can we go fly over Central Park? 
 We're going to Jersey? 
 (sings along to song) "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..." 
: 
 Fifty million dollars. 
 The shit has hit the fan, kid.  Take a look. 
 Been breaking all morning. 
 At a news conference earlier today, Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this beleaguered city its latest dose of bad news.  He revealed that the man who caused a sensation at basketball arena last night is no hero... he is, in fact, a mass murderer. 
 Look.  You were really high.  Things happen. 
 I think you're looking at him. 
 (Adrian's voice) My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all you suckers for no reason! 
 He superimposed your head onto "Scarface." 
 ...which is by far DePalma's best work... 
 Dude, it's us.  Let us in. 
 There's like a total mob scene coming this way. 
 Looks like they're following a giant trail of bug shit. 
 What'll we do now, Beefy? 
 I don't know, this is a little out of my league. 
 (O.S.) Come on.  Let's get 'em. 
 What would your dad do, Nicky? 
 Dude.  Seriously? 
 I've always wanted to kill someone.  Can I do it? 
 Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up. 
 Die, Grandma, die! 
 Royal flush, you lose.  Off with the bra. 
 LUCIFER (CONT'D) Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big, two hillbillies were blowing on them. 
 What are you gonna do?  Look at me, Nicky!  I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear... 
 DAD (CONT'D) I got no ears!  I can't hear! 
 I can't hear you, Nicky.  I can't hear anything! 
 Put it back on my head.  I'm falling apart here. 
 You sure you're down with this? 
 Little nervous.  Wanna puke. 
 JOHN (CONT'D) Looking for the chief. 
 We know where to find Nicky. 
 Sure do.  You got what we want? 
 Fifty million bones, bro. 
 Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man. He's not human. 
 We think he's the son of Satan. 
 Hey, watch it!  Who do you think you are? 
 Where is he?  He's late. 
 He'll be here.  Just keep your cool, kid. 
 BEEFY (CONT'D) We've been ratted out. 
 You guys.  That was so uncool. 
 We thought the son of Satan would understand a move like this. 
 Noon... 
 JOHN (CONT'D) ...ish. 
 So even though you're not really the chief, we still get the rest of the cash, right bro? 
 But what about the cash?  Can we keep it or what? 
 (mumbling to herself) Food stamps? They should call 'em "dude stamps." Cause ever time I get one, some dude takes it away... 
 LADY (CONT'D) Hey, studs.  I'll let you make out with me for a dollar! 
 No thanks...but we'll take that bottle of booze. (grabs the bottle, laughs) 
 Hey...that's mine. 
 Beat it, ya freak. 
 Schnapps... 
 (takes the bag, swigs) Peppermint...alright. 
 Wanna hit? 
 Drink up.  Here's to fifty million clams. 
 Whatever.  Knock it back, grab Nicky and let's get outta this hell-hole. 
 Weed lowers the body temperature. (stuttering) I read that...in, uh...er, science magazine. 
 Definitely. 
 And give you a good buzz. 
 Uh.  No it won't? 
 Urr...uggg...errr... 
 JOHN/NICKY Urrr...uggh... (as Nicky) Oww.  Adrian, this is very painful. 
 (O.S.) All right.  Let me out. 
 (O.S.) You mother... 
 Oh, he's gotta pee. 
 Run, Beefy!  Run! 
 Don't do it. 
 ADRIAN'S LEG. 
 Now that hurt the both of us. 
 Oh. My. G-d.  I can't believe you're here.  Welcome.  Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now. 
 So excited. 
 She really is. 
 I'm sorry, you're just so cute. 
 Do you have any idea where you are right now? 
 Maybe try the opposite of that. 
 ANGEL (CONT'D) Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom? 
 (annoyed) A mountain goat?  That's really sweet. 
 Try an angel. 
 Unh-huh.  Which would make you half angel. 
 Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair. 
 ANGEL (CONT'D) I'm sorry, I'm totally busting on you. I'm your mom. 
 I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest look on your face. 
 You're gonna be so happy she did that. 
 Angels don't get any older, son. 
 I can't believe you just called him "son." 
 Oh my G-d.  This is so wild. 
 I can't see shit.  You're all still here, right? 
 Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came through. 
 Boooo. 
 You'll get nothing out of me. 
 The only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely. 
 Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power. 
 All boobs and no balls. 
 Ahhh! 
 I don't get no respect. 
 ADRIAN (CONT'D) Wow.  And this is just a little taste of my power. 
 Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons, get him out of the chair! 
 No, their mother's weren't angels. 
 I think they were hookers or strippers or something really porno like... 
 Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your Mambo lesson. 
 Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so sorry.  I have company.  It's my son, Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it? 
 Wow, that's terrific. 
 Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a golf pro, but up here he's the dopest dance instructor. 
 You mambo? 
 Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's all in the hips. 
 It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer. 
 I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris. 
 Try four and a half.  At first I totally didn't like him. 
 He was really conceited. 
 But I don't know, he was funny, he made me laugh, and I hate to say it but he had a really nice body. 
 Well, I really wasn't thinking about making a baby at the time! 
 ANGEL (CONT'D) Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv!  I'll call you back... (laughs) Oh my G-d, I will call you back, goodbye. (hangs up) That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi." 
 I'll call her later. 
 You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life. 
 That was so cool. 
 That's why you came up to Heaven instead of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here. 
 We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth.  Look. 
 (O.S.) All these good people have totally been led astray. 
 (O.S.) Show him Central Park. 
 (O.S.) There's like a three day rave goin' on down there.  No on is going to work anymore. 
 (O.S.) Let's see... 
 I was a good Devil, wasn't I? 
 Absolutely. 
 I tried to do some interesting stuff... 
 I don't know how you came up with some of it. 
 Really?  That means a lot to me. 
 (O.S.) Oh my G-d.  He looks gross. 
 (O.S.) I can't believe I did it with him. 
 ADRIAN (CONT'D) You're acting as if there is no Heaven or Hell. 
 There is most definitely a Hell!  And you're all going there when you die! Which will happen in about fifteen minutes. 
 We really are gonna die! 
 This don't look good. 
 Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this? 
 They castrated him.  He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke. 
 I can't screw. (whimpers) I can't screw. 
 She's so nice. 
 She goes to Parson's, right? 
 I would totally love to go there.  But I hear it's really hard to get in. 
 Yeah, you do... 
 ADRIAN (CONT'D) So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I bring you a dear sweet man and an international icon...Henry Winkler! 
 Stronger, yes.  Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have. 
 No, you have the inner light.  You can totally use it.  It's the best power of all. (he smiles) And in case you get in real bad trouble, G-d told me to give you this. 
 I'm not a hundred percent on that.  G-d said when the time comes, you'll know what to do. 
 G-d's so smart. 
 The smartest. 
 Well, goodbye...for now. (looks at his face) Can I just do this? 
 ANGEL (CONT'D) That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it? 
 Totally. 
 It would be so okay. 
 (O.S.) You're already there... 
 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Release the good... 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Release the awesome. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Put it in your mouth and let it slide down your throat-hole. 
 Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'! 
 One thing I really regret is never having experimented sexually. 
 You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen Burner?  What are you talking about? 
 He means getting it on with someone like that freak. 
: 
 His name is Andrew.  I know that guy. 
 Of course you do, Tommy Tune. 
 You think so?  Why don't you come a little closer and I'll show you a better angle. 
 Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit. 
 That turn you on there, RuPaul? 
 You want a queen?  Got one right here. 
 (eating Popeye's chicken) It's true! 
 
 
 ADRIAN (CONT'D) Enough.  I'm going to kill you with my bare hands. 
 I totally had to do that. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?! 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Now will you get in the flask? 
 ADRIAN (CONT'D) A little help over here. 
 
 ADRIAN (CONT'D) Henry! 
 
 Oh no. 
 (O.S.) Come on in, bro. 
 CASSIUS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Thank you, Nicky.  Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open. 
 Nicky! 
 Kill him, Adrian. 
 Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that? 
 (whispering) Nicky. Nicky. 
 VALERIE (CONT'D) You gotta fly out...I know you can do it. (still no response) Do it for the butterflies. 
 Hello, New York. 
 Put him in, Ozzy. 
 Grand Central, Nicky.  Start running. 
 He'll never make it. 
 You gotta kill yourself. 
 No if you do something bad right before you die. 
 Aw, man, not again. 
 NICKY (CONT'D) Do me. 
 I love you. 
 Okay, you just saw my son save the universe.  Right?! 
 You came through, Nicky. 
 You're back in Hell now, kid.  There's no butterflies here.  If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth. 
 Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting. (Dad looks up) That's right, you heard me, Holly.  I'm still in love with you. 
 Oh my G-d.  He's totally talking about me. 
 And don't think I forgot about how crazy you get after a few daiquiris. 
 That guy is still a horn dog. 
 Listen, I got down low.  Your mom's got up high.  You take care of the middle. 
 Let me handle that. 
 LUCIFER (CONT'D) And I'm not using a pineapple this time. 
 (O.S.) Don't do it! 
 Holy Schnit! 
 Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby. 
 Thank yo. 
 Such a little angel. 
 Only a quarter, ma'am. 
 (sounds like Nicky) Sorry.

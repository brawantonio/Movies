 
 (O.S.) And breath...and chataronga... 
. 
 (O.S.) (over answering machine; sweet, British, slightly desperate) Joe, it's Lucy.  Remember me?  It's the black sheep here.  Bah...not funny. Haven't heard from you, need you, call me.  Love you madly.  Hi, Sally.  Joe, I'd love to talk to you before I go... 
 Go where? 
 (O.S.) (over answering machine) It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big brother.  Sorry I drone on.  I miss you. I lo-- 
 
 America, could you just... 
 JOE (CONT'D) (calls out) Thank you, America! 
 Okay, let's just take a deep breath, let your ribs expand and relax.  And reach up and into downward dog. 
 (O.S.) (over answering machine) Hello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for Sally Therrian. 
 Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan? 
 Happy anniversary. 
 And change sides... 
 (with the authority of long years of service) Mr. Joe, we have to have the house.  If you please now... 
 It's yours. 
 I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world. 
 Accept a compliment. 
 What did you get me? 
 Kiss my eyes. 
 Kiss the back of my knees. 
 Not. 
 You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you? 
 (after a beat) No.  I missed that. 
 We're great. 
 For good. 
 JOE (CONT'D) Don't get it. 
 What? 
 Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her. 
 She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold. 
 (regards her) You want me to uninvite her? 
 (into the receiver) Skye! (his face lights) I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually. (flattered) You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left. 
 JOE (CONT'D) Oh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure they're well behaved.  All our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So we sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry. 
 JOE (O.S.) (CONT'D) I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really. 
 (O.S.) I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna. 
 Who the fuck can be here at this time? It's not even seven! 
 
 I'll say as little as possible. 
 I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry. 
 You have to sign your taxes anyway. 
 (kisses Judy; all charm) You can never be too early or too thin. 
 Happy anniversary, buddy!  Six months ago, who would have thunk it? 
 (sotto) Well, not me, to be honest. 
 (sotto) Don't fuck up again.  It's got a ripple effect.  Sally suffers, we all suffer. 
 (offers) We have a gift? 
 Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne? 
 Lovely. 
 (a moment, to Sally) We closed. 
 (finally, to no one, and to no response) The house looks beautiful, are those hydrangeas? 
 Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing. 
 I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest. 
 The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat. 
 What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city. 
 You only made half your quote this year. 
 I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground. 
 Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you. 
 (O.S.) Otis!  No barking! 
 Not millions. 
 They're paying him scale. 
 There's still time to undo this. 
 (re: barking dog) Did you invite them? 
 That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them. 
 Did you tell Joe to behave? 
 Did he promise? 
 Before I forget. (pulls a novel from his briefcase) Put it on the bookshelf. 
. 
 Just do what I say, alright? 
 Beats a lawsuit. 
 (to fill the silence, conspiratorial grin) I love gifts.  What did you guys get us? 
 (chokes on the champagne) Nothing that can't be exchanged. 
 Oh.  Well.  Good. 
 Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book. 
 The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead. 
 Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful. 
 Yes, she is. 
 (trying harder) But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally. 
 It's a novel. 
 Still.  Well.  Let's drop it. 
 Yes. 
 I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron? 
 No. 
 It's very good. (a moment) I understand you won the Booker Prize. 
 Yes I did. 
 (another moment) Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find? 
 Don't I find what? 
 I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long... 
 Not long. 
 (benign) Don't be silly. 
 Joking. 
 Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that -- 
 Do I put you off? 
 You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you. 
 And I you. 
 But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid. 
 Ah. 
 And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see? 
 Mmm hmmm. 
 I'm the wife.  We've met. 
 (hugs her) You, I know. 
 (a grin) Jack?  Jack, you promised. 
 (sings) Happy anniversary to you.  We're glad Joe came home.  Don't split up again.  Cause we like the food. 
 (in the archway) Jack.  Did you compose that yourself? 
 Had a little help? 
 It has your ring. 
 Cal, my wife Judy. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 No, I don't think so. 
 (to Cal) Congratulations on the Academy Award. Great performance.  Really warranted. 
 He thought so. 
 Sally always manages to get robbed. 
 Evie has a little something for you. 
 SOPHIA (CONT'D) You do. 
 (even) I don't think so. 
 (her mother's daughter) Never. 
 (bright smile) Honey, we have gifts for you and all sorts of surprises.  Where is America?  I know she's here somewhere. 
 I'll take them. 
 No, I have a little talking to do with America.  Privately.  I'll find her. 
 Who'd like to go and find Otis? 
 Me! 
 I guess. 
 The infamous dog? 
 He's the best dog in the world. (to Judy) They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea. 
 Ours. 
 It's Jerry's worst idea. 
 The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I? (to Sally) Wouldn't I? 
 (to the kids) Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum. 
 Well, hello you two. (putting Evie down; to Jack) These are the people who live next door. Say hello. 
 JOE (CONT'D) And close the door, Jack.  Because if we leave it open, Otis will run out and you know what will happen then? 
 Uh, uh. 
 He'll run next door into their backyard and he'll bark and bark and bark and eat their pitbull for his dinner.  Is it a pitbull? 
 (not amused) No, actually. 
 (to Jack) Oh whatever.  We don't want that to happen, do we? 
 No? 
 It's a rottweiler, actually. (to Jack) I don't think our rottweiler is in any danger, Jack. 
 Well, Jack and I are very relieved. 
 I thought this was a party.  Are we going to talk about the dog thing? 
 Please, Ryan. 
 (kisses her cheek and shakes his hand) No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink? 
 Not for me, thanks. 
 (checks with Ryan) Something soft. 
 Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan? 
 I'm sure, yes. 
 Sally? 
 Yes. 
 We could hardly say no. 
 At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape. 
 It's just very distracting when you're trying to work. 
 Ryan. 
 (to Joe) I'm sure you understand. 
 Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself. 
 Ryan! 
 (caught short; flattered) Well, yes, actually. 
 He always has two or three going... 
 
 You lose this? 
 (re: Otis) Ah there's our snookums now. 
 Yes, well, but I haven't won a Booker either.  Or the Whitebread. 
 The gate was open. 
 It's taken care of. 
 I think Ryan needs a new publisher.  I think he's outgrown him.  They're just not doing their job. 
 Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house. 
 Yes. 
 Well, whoever did this is amazing. 
 (comes on them with the Forsythes in tow) She rarely cops to it. (kisses Sally's cheek) Otis is home. 
 (re: the gifts) Where can I put these? 
 CLAIR (CONT'D) What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number. 
 She already has. 
 It's alright, isn't it? 
 Clair is a hovering mother. 
 I'm not. 
 (a wide professionally ingratiating smile) So nice... 
 And for us... Truly. 
 Well... 
 You will never know. 
 (pleased) Oh. (to Sally) I have a four-thirty call.  AM.  So we may have to leave early. 
 What? 
 (searches) He's allergic. 
 To dander.  Otis. 
 Didn't I say? 
 They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up. 
 So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course. (kisses her cheek) How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore. 
 (as grounded as Clair isn't) It's an object lesson in grace. (on seeing Cal Gold on the back porch) Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once. 
 Fuck you. 
 (laughing) Oh man, you are so fucking funny in the kitchen scene. 
 Nothing you do is accidental... 
 (re: the cameras) I'm the hired help. 
 (affectionate) Fuck you. 
 I never put myself in harm's way. 
 Anymore. 
 No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout. 
 
 Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming? 
 And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold. (rescuing Sally) Come meet my husband, Cal. 
 Cal Gold? 
 The very one.  And you are... 
 Rose. 
 Sorry? 
 Ryan Rose. 
 Yes. 
 Ah. 
 Hmm. (to Sally) Where are my kids? 
 I hope they're watercolors! 
 (to Monica) Would you like to meet my husband? 
 I'd be thrilled. 
 Then he'll be thrilled. 
 (re: Sophia, appreciative) She's such pure evil. 
 Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two. (to Joe) Can you help me with this stuff? 
 (re: one of her bags) That for us? 
 What a nose.  You missed your calling. 
 Can I open it? 
 (defers) Sally? 
 Please? 
 I love you,  Gina Taylor. 
 You look so well, Clair.  A wraith. 
 (pleased) You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know. 
 I'm glad that's all over for me. 
 Don't you miss it? 
 Never. 
 Really. 
 Not for a second.  Cal can have all that. 
 Really? 
 So where is young Jonah? 
 With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids. 
 What is that thing? 
 So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him. 
 You should have brought him. 
 (shrugs) Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis. 
 Oh.  Do you have any pictures? 
 Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth. 
 Are you the funniest person I know, or what? 
 I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph. 
 CLAIR (CONT'D) (freeks) Oh my God, the dog! 
 It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying. 
 I'll change back before we leave. 
 I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby. 
 And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually. 
 I'd love a Xanex. (a moment) Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding. 
 You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing. 
 Just don't fucking tell her. 
 (opens the door) Panes!  How are you? 
 Oh, you know, I am. 
 Has she called? 
 She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally? 
 It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself. 
 Suicidal.  It's much less codependent. 
 Not enough. 
 (gives everyone a shy, pained little wave) Oh great. 
 Panes! 
 MONICA/RYAN (a little late; into silence) Panes. 
 Hi. 
 (his face lights up) Skye! 
 You're Joe, aren't you? (nods knowingly) I recognized you from the book jacket. 
 How do you do, Skye? 
 Oh, I love that. (throws arms around him) I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are. 
 (uncomfortable) Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends. 
 (genuine) When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual... 
 I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you. 
 You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director. 
 (finally) I think you're my first Goddess. 
 She's even better looking in the flesh. 
 You don't know she's a bitch. 
 It could be worse. 
 She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours. 
 You see, that's worse. 
 Like your business managers? 
 Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake. 
 It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties. 
 "How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart." 
 No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life. 
 I wasn't finished. 
 "We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks." 
 I didn't hear me say tonight. 
 "Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here." 
 (stuck) Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting. 
 (over Sally) Come on in. 
 I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself. 
 Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman. 
 SKYE (CONT'D) And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality. 
 Not at all. 
 Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers? 
 No, never. 
 I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds. 
 (to America) Oh my God, she remembers me! 
 (on the way down; a dream in white) My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life. 
 (re: the dress) I'd cut off her red wine if I were you. 
 What does that mean? 
 (regards him) Directing suits you. 
 I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months. 
 It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden. 
 Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked. 
 Just did.  Jealous? 
 When does he graduate high school? 
 (laughing) Oh, very jealous. 
 GINA (CONT'D) I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her. 
 Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold. 
 In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million. 
 Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job. 
 You really need to be fucked. 
 Why don't you go fuck yourself? 
 I'm worried about your Galiano. 
 No, really, five thousand with your discount. 
 PANES (CONT'D) You hurt, you know.  You're stronger than you think. 
 PANES (CONT'D) (finally) How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you? 
 That's it?  Yes.  Fine? 
 Why not? 
 Alright.  Well, that's something new. 
 Well, something's wrong. 
 (a moment; little smile) Um.  Happy for you. 
 So tell me, how's it going? 
 You're my best friend. 
 Yes, you're a monster. 
 You don't need to thank me. 
 I guess. 
 Let me. (pours for her) I'm Jeffrey. 
 Monica. 
 And you know our friends, how? 
 We live next door. 
 Oh.  You're them. 
 Excuse me? 
 We've heard lots about you. 
 (lost) You have? 
 (smiles over at Ryan) Hi. 
 Hi.  A little close in there. 
 Yup. 
 Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red. 
 You're an interior decorator, right? 
 (nods) Sally did all this herself? 
 In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing. 
 (somehow at a loss) Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe. 
 Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux. (re: champagne) I see you've moved up from the soft stuff. 
 Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I'm a little nervous, so... 
 Oh. 
 A little out of my element. 
 No you're not. 
 Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction. 
 Hm. 
 I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating. 
 Very well put. 
 I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort. 
 What? 
 But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism... 
 (pissed) Elitism? 
 The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly. 
 And you know, he really does not. 
 And Ryan works at home. 
 And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you. 
 JOE (CONT'D) Oh shit.  I'm sorry. 
 Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually. 
 Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis. 
 Alright. 
 Easy tiger. 
 Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking. 
 Scout's honor. 
 (grins) I'll be your best friend. 
 MONICA (CONT'D) Would you sign it for me. (digs for a pen) I'm sure this is inappropriate. 
 We're way past inappropriate. 
 (as he signs it) I'll treasure this. 
 I need to leave you now. 
 I will treasure this. 
 (shouting down the hall) Sally!!!! 
 From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle... 
 What? 
 It's Shostakovich. 
 The Wind Up Bird Chronicle. 
 (pleased) I didn't know you had this. 
 Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it? 
 Good idea. 
 There's not a chance in hell anyone will get it... 
 Down by Law. 
 Who's not going to get that in fifteen seconds. 
 Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal. 
 The Katzenjammer Kids. 
 MONICA (CONT'D) You know.  It's the Funnies.  The Katzenjammer Kids.  It's my mother's favorite charade's clue.  No one ever gets it. 
 Alright.  Good.  Fine, I vote for that. 
 With a "Z."  K. A. T. Z. 
 When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows... 
 GINA (CONT'D) What?

 Who's keeping time? 
 JOE (CONT'D) Two minutes. 
 (offers the hat) You darling. 
 (reads clue; to Joe) What is it? 
 PANES (CONT'D) What's a sign for that? 
 Come on, Panes... 
 Go! 
 What the hell is that? 
 Two words. 
 Funny. 
 Funnies? 
 The Katzenjammer Kids. 
 (already pissed) It's only just started.  Great.  The husband's on the other fucking team. 
 Go. 
 Hey!  Would you? 
 It was fifteen seconds. 
 I don't think so. 
 Are you always this much fun? 
 I'm ready. 
 Cycle. 
 Think.  Pain. 
 Come on, folks. 
 To, the, but, or... 
 TEAM (CONT'D) Third word.  One syllable. 
 TEAM (CONT'D) Fuck...sounds like... Fork.  Flock... 
 TEAM (CONT'D) Fuck.  Folk. 
 TEAM (CONT'D) Second word. 
 Thirty seconds. 
 Jer.  Over here.  Over here. 
 Second word. 
 (blurts out) From Jewish Folk Poetry. 
 Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!! 
 (she's up; turns to him, zeig heil's him) Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi? 
 Well it's fucking time. 
 JERRY (CONT'D) (shouting guesses) Walk.  Cripple.  Limp.  Ankle.  Second syllable.  Second syllable.  Move on to the fucking second syllable. 
 JERRY (CONT'D) (sings out) The clock is ticking! 
 Time. 
 SALLY'S TEAM (unison) Quote.  Play. 
 Oh shit.  It's one of Cal's.  Obscure Shakespeare, folks. 
 SOPHIA (CONT'D) (calls over to him) Maybe something original for a change. 
 SALLY'S TEAM (in unison) Ten...twenty...thirty...seven, eight. Thirty-eighth word...thirty-seventh word. 
 Time! 
 What was it?  What the fuck was it? 
 Ryan's novel? 
 Ryan's novel, Jerry. 
 (sings out) Dinner! 
 Panes is not on your team anymore. 
 What did I do? 
 Dinner. 
 It's an unfair advantage. 
 Okay, knock it off. 
 Truce. 
 (pissed) I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake. 
 (barely looks up as Sally comes into the room) So who won? 
 Ten, fifteen minutes ago. 
 I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners. 
 (charmed by the bundle in Astrid's arm) Oh how sweet. 
 She's insanely jealous. 
 That's revolting, Astrid. 
 Is there space here? 
 Yes. 
 Do you need anything else? 
 No, no thanks. 
 (finally) I was impressed. 
 Oh? 
 The charades. 
 Thank you. 
 That was my clue. 
 Oh? 
 The Shostakovich. 
 Really?? 
 (does Seller's Indian) Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see. 
 PANES (CONT'D) (still Indian) So you are well acquainted with this Shostackovich, as am I. 
 I hate the idea of some one else living in it. 
 JOE (CONT'D) Sally's never even seen it.  I thought we'd raise our kids there. 
 JOE (CONT'D) Have I ever told you how Lucy and I nearly squashed each other getting into the dumb waiter. 
 The dumb waiter was our... 
 Escape hatch. 
 (eyes her) Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted... 
 Whatever! (to Gina) You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day... 
 SALLY/JEFFREY I realized I had become a man.  Ta da! 
 You're not a man, Joe.  You're a boy. 
 (childishly) So? 
 (laughs) I love you, Joe Therrian. 
 
 You're not upset that I brought the dog? 
 Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new. (fixes on Ryan) Who's that? 
 Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out? 
 Like you didn't know. (re: Skye) Who invited the bimbo? 
 (re: the cake as it comes in) Part of our gift.  Honey!! 
 
 I wasn't prepared to say anything.  I'm honored to be a part of tonight.  To be in the same room, with my favorite living actress... 
 (sings out) Still living. 
 And my favorite novelist.  And all their amazing -- 
 (sings out) And talented. 
 Friends.  And talented friends.  This room is so filled with love.. 
 (sings out) And the winner is... 
 Let the woman speak. 
 And I brought a gift of love.  A gift that is love. 
 SKYE (CONT'D) (tears up) Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it. 
 (pleased, surprised) Dolphins.  Great. 
 I think there are sixteen there. 
 (kisses Skye) This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are. 
 (Anouk still in her lap) It's late. (kisses Anouk) You sleepy baby? 
 I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time. 
 (laughs) Oh honey, you're gonna love it. 
 (to her Look) Sophia's going to do it, Panes is going to do it, trust me. 
 (his glare; simply) I want to try it, Ryan. 
 I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan. (touches her own cheek, ever so lightly; shivers against the sensation) Utterly fantastic. 
 You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water. 
 Do you want to go home, Ryan? 
 Yes. 
 I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila. 
 I'm not going to leave you alone. 
 They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us... 
 They're nothing like us. 
 I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people... 
 Are you making an ass of yourself? 
 There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need... 
 I don't need a drug. 
 You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words. 
 Ready to go? 
 I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry. (turns back) Ryan, you're a great man. 
 This water is great! 
 (swimming past her) Wanna dive for a baton? 
 Okay, I'm about to throw five colored batons in the water.  Then I'm going to count to three, and then you may start diving.  I'm playing too.  The red one is ten extra points.  Ready? (she throws batons in) One, two, three, go!! 
 You got your DP? 
 What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list. 
 And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies? 
 Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac? 
 Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you. 
 Thanks, Mac. (regards him) And thanks for being so supportive about all this. (throws arm around him, hugs him close) I really love you, you know. 
 Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do. 
 (lets go of Mac) God, I really need to jump about a bit. (begins jumping) How's your film going? 
 And how's the diva doing? 
 Well, you know...good days, bad days. 
 I meant Sally. 
 I meant Sally. 
 (stops jumping, studies him) Oh.  You're serious. 
 (throws and arm around him) No.  No. (a beat) Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone. 
 Oh don't.  Everyone says that. 
 Yes. 
 Hm. 
 I thought it was okay where it was. 
 A notch above the storage room. 
 The both of you. 
 So how much do you hate her? 
 Well, I don't trust her.  I never have. 
 (a moment simply) I trust you. 
 You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing. 
 You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that. 
 Well good.  Thank God. 
 Oh honey, let's. 
 Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it? 
 Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story. 
 He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material. 
 Don't try and change the subject. (sitting, joining Sally) Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable. 
 Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight? 
 (laughing) I don't have a drug problem. 
 His sister does.  Big time.  And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article. 
 SOPHIA (CONT'D) You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back. 
 (following her) Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut. 
 Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel. 
 His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic. 
 (also tearing up) No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway. 
 SOPHIA (CONT'D) He's always one step removed, always looking over his shoulder always looking for something else, something more intoxicating, and I don't mean drugs.  I love him, Sal, but he's a child.  He's not ready. (a choked sob, tears well and fall) Oh God, you're so lucky you don't have kids.  You can't stick your head in the oven.  You can't take a handful of Percoden if you want to, or slit your wrists.  You can't do yourself in.  Kids rob you of that option.  Trust me. (a beat) Oh my God, this ecstacy must be really good. 
 Isn't Skye amazing? 
 She's a constant surprise. 
 Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and... (taps his head) The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice? 
 Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her. 
 With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them. 
 Has anyone seen Mac? 
 (pointing further up the property) I saw him wandering over there, I think. How're you feeling, Clair? 
 I'm so good. 
 No, what? 
 Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay? 
 Who, Sally? 
 I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors. 
 What? 
 (stares at him) Leo? 
 (regards him) Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed. 
 October-ish. 
 Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal. 
 Scratch the two, write in a four. 
 Five years ago, I was at the party, remember? 
 (moans) No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck. 
 (O.S.) Jesus Christ. 
 Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy. 
 I'm in mourning. 
 You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do. 
 Not this time. 
 It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone. 
 (an observation) You don't have any clothes on. 
 How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious. (re: the film) You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas. 
 Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth. 
 Things always look much worse in the morning. 
 I don't know how to make her funny. 
 You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie. 
 (really stoned) What what's about? 
 I...wait, what are you talking about? 
 
 Are you okay? 
 I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny. 
 Let's go for a walk. 
 I've never done this before. 
 Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl. 
 I'm a little in the puke zone. 
 (giving her some water) Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water. (puts the bottle in her hand) Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow. (sits her down; produces a lollipop) Would you like a lolly? 
 What am I, five? 
 You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one. 
 (a grin) Okay. 
 Lemon or raspberry? 
 Lemon. 
 Lemon it is. 
 (finally) Ryan's really angry with me. 
 I think he's really angry with me too. 
 (laughs) It's really not the same thing. (a moment) He was really nicer when he drank. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment. 
 That's a lot of those. 
 Medallions. 
 A lot of cakes. 
 Yes. 
 And he doesn't smoke? 
 He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better. 
 How long have you been married? 
 Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about. 
 You must have been a baby. 
 Oh yes.  Nineteen...just. (a moment) I'm cold. 
 Come here. 
 (a moment) That's very nice. 
 I like you. 
 I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre. 
 Sorry? 
 I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it? 
 (humors her) Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred. (thinks a moment) No, nothing at all. 
 I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know. 
 Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate. 
 (horrified) I'm sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 (at a loss) I... 
 Stop being such a bitch, Sal. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis. 
 Listen to yourself... (to Monica) Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him. (to Sally) What's wrong with you? 
 Well he can't have gone far. 
 He'll find his way back. 
 (calming) Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical. 
 Or shitty!!  Otis!! 
 How long have you worked for the Therrians? 
 (shrugs, polite but annoyed) A long time. 
 So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence? 
 Oh yes. 
 Did you know the contractor? 
 Very well. 
 Was it a contractor? 
 It's the way they do things. 
 To code? 
 RYAN (CONT'D) Did you see permits?  Did he have a license? 
 You should talk to Mr. Joe. 
 Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog. 
 You're not serious. 
 I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car! 
 God willing. 
 We have to find the dog, Ryan. 
 Why? 
 (regards him) Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around. (desperate) Because, God help you if something happens to that dog? 
 Excuse me? 
 All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan. (a beat) They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH. 
 Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism. 
 Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!! 
 Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov? 
 Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky. 
 I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know. 
 Do Peter Sellers again. 
 (a la Sellers) Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry. 
 I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony. 
 Set to the poem of Yetveshenko! 
 Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research. 
 Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich? 
 Yeah. 
 Would you, like, marry him? 
 If he were still alive, maybe. 
 How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich? 
 (smiling) Are you asking me to marry you? 
 No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are. 
 (laughing) Very. 
 Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two? 
 Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty... (lops off two years) Five. 
 (on her heels) Otis!!!! 
 This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs. 
 Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate. 
 Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier. 
 Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect! 
 Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this. 
 Otis! 
 Love? 
 That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time. 
 DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying. 
 Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this. 
 Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second... 
 That is not true. 
 Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy. 
 It's a novel. 
 Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally. 
 Hello?  Last birthday was? 
 Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently. 
 Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress. 
 Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally. 
 Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally. 
 Sally, for Christ's sake. 
 This is insanity. (moves toward her) Sally... 
 Don't push me away. 
 Don't do this. 
 (threatens) Don't do this! 
 You changed your mind. 
 What?!  You aborted our child?! 
 You're not ready. 
 I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us? 
 I'll never forgive you. 
 I have no idea who you are. 
 Oh my God.  Honey??? 
 He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room? 
 (his face against concrete) Man, I must really be stoned. (wipes tears from his face with his hand) Thanks, buddy. 
 Honey? 
 I'm fine, babe. 
 Give him a minute, Clair. 
 (humiliated) Hey. (looks over at Jerry) Thanks, buddy. 
 Anytime, sport. 
 (wants to say "don't call me sport") Yeah, thanks pal. 
 (helpless) Honey? 
 I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close. 
 Probably not. 
 (to Jerry) So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what? 
 There's a test, you know. 
 (embarrassed) Forget it, Judy. 
 (still scared) Honey? 
 I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute. 
 (paces; at himself) You're okay.  Buck up.  Come on, be a man.  It could happen to anybody. (tears start again) If you don't stop, I'm going to punch your face in. (another moment) 
 MAC (CONT'D) Oh shit.  I can't fucking do anything right.  Come on, come on.  Oh thank you God for giving me this chance.  Thank you for having Jerry here to save me.  I promise I will never cheat on my wife again.  I will never take drugs again, and I will be a great fucking husband and a loving father.  I am a great father!  I have terrific friends.  I am a brilliant director.  Well-respected.  I won a Golden Globe, how 'bout that?  Yeah, man, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright. And God, I will be humble. 
 MAN'S VOICE Joe, Joe!  It's your Dad!  Pick up, Joe... 
 (picks up receiver) Harry, hi, it's Gina!  Gina.  Is everything alright? (a deep intake of breath) Oh my God.  When?  He's not here. They're out looking for Otis.  The dog, Harry. (tears start down her face) I love you so much.  Lucy's a fighter, she'll make it.  Whether she wants to or not.  Harry.  I'm so sorry.  I will. (writes down the number) Yes I will.  Take care, Harry.  Bye. 
 Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero? 
 You're crazy baby.  I love you. 
 Are you my big hard hero? 
 Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you? 
 Oh yeah... 
 Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you. 
 Oh yeah? 
 Let me heal you, baby. 
 (mantra) Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus. 
 Oh yeah. 
 ...no, no, start again. 
 I've lost my husband and my beeper.  Have either of you seen either of them? 
 
 What is it? 
 Let's go upstairs, okay? 
 GINA (CONT'D) Let's go upstairs. 
 What happened? 
 The suspense is killing me. 
 Harry called. 
 (growing dread) And? 
 (there's now way to say it) Lucy overdosed. 
 (a long moment) But she's alright. 
 She's in ICU. 
 (laughs; shakes his head) Stupid tart. 
 She left a note. 
 (realizes the import; to Gina) Fuck you. 
 You need to call your dad. 
 Leave us alone right now. 
 I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go. 
 I love her too, Joe. 
 Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now? 
 (inconsolable) I don't want you to go. 
 JOE (CONT'D) I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight. 
 I don't want to go tonight. 
 (bereft) Stupid tart. 
 How's he doing? 
 He's gonna miss his flight. 
 Is he not going?  I booked a flight. 
 I told his father he'd be on that flight. 
 Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy. 
 It's not a contest. 
 So much for ecstacy, right? 
 Let's get the kids. 
 Oh my God, the sitter. 
 (dials phone, a moment) Hey, Dad... 
 I'm going to be home all weekend, call if you need anything. 
 I call that a perfect day. 
 A perfect night. 
 Damn near. (long moment) And a damn near perfect drug. 
 Hm.  We should do it again. 
 Just every once in a blue moon, you know. 
 Hm. (a long moment) You think we should ask them for their landscaper? 
 Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors? 
 Not as a rule. 
 (a long moment) They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns! 
 (kisses Sally; whispers) Take good care of it. 
 (appalled) Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog! 
 (regards them) Don't go in, Ryan. 
 What? 
 Let's just go home, okay? 
 Coffee? 
 Sure. 
 I'll do it. 
 I don't mind... 
 Can I come in? 
 My plane leaves in a few hours. 
 (simply) No. 
 (a moment) Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it? 
 Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it. (a moment) We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself. (regards her) I'll never love anybody else, you know. 
 That's under lock and key. 
 Happy anniversary. 
 I know. 
 I know.  It's for the baby's crib. 
 Oh, Sally Mae...

 Bravo, Mike! Bravo! Bellisimot 
 Did you really make all that up? They pass. 
 The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed by them. They have to climb over some. 
 I sent away for this stuff from Wyoming. It'll tell you everything. Since you don't believe me maybe you'll believe it when you see it. 
 And we'd work on the same ranch and sleep in the bunkhouse together, eh? Cont.

 That's the whole point. 
 I always miss the whole point. 
 It'd be nice to have a paying Job again, that's for sure. 
 Niente laborare. Niente mangare. 
 What's that mean? 
 You don't work. You don't eat. 
 That's a terrible thing to say. 
 Are you really going to shave your legs? 
 Certo. All the Italians do it. 
 That's some country. The women don't shave theirs.

; hand on heart) It was somewhere along here that I lost all interest in life. Ah, right over there. I.saw Dolores Reineke and fat Marvin. Why? Why Dolores? 
 They're married now. Coat.

 You see what I saved you from, Cyril. Had I not told you about the two of them you never would have followed them out here. 
- Thank you, Mike. You made me lose all interest in life and I'm grateful. 
 My brother says he saw you and Nancy. Moocher. 
 When? 
 Last Friday? 
 Wasn't me. I'm not seeing her anymore. 
 They are now standing above a huge pool of water with sheer cliffs on three sides. Abandoned derricks loom in the distance. Dave is now humming softly a Neapolitan song. They begin the descent. 
 I kind of miss school. You know. This will be the first time nobody's going to ask us to write a theme about how we spent our summer. 
 Remember the Tomb of the Unknown Substitute Teacher. 
 She believed us too.

 You leave home. 
 My dad says Jesus never went further than fifty miles from his home. Mike is skipping down the rocks toward the water, taking clothes off as he does. The rest follow. 
 And look what happened to him. Mike jumps into the water. Moocher and Cyril follow. Dave looks on. 
'S P.O.V. 1-A The guys are swimming. Dave is holding his trophy casually, enjoying the beautiful day. He pulls out a little Italian Phrase Book. Finds what he wants. 
 Oggi fa bello,-non e vero? 
 Sure thing, partner. 
 C'mon in. 
 I read where this Italian coach said you should never swim after a race. 
 Who's swimming? I'm taking a leak. Moocher and Mike splash water at him and swim away.

 Aren't you glad we got fired from The A and P. Right now we'd be X working. 
 We didn't get fired. You got- fired. We quit.

 There aren't many places, you know, that'll hire all four of 
 
 You know what I'd like to be? 
 Smart. 
 A cartoon of some kind. Man, X that'd be great. Like when they get hit on their head with a frying pan and their head looks like a frying pan-with a handle and everything. And then they go b-r-r-r. (shakes his head) And their head comes back to normal. That'd be great.. 
 How come you're so stupid, Cyril. 
 I don't know. I think I have a dumb heredity. What's your excuse, Mike? Mike hits him hard on the arm. Cyril winces. Mike stands up. He makes sure they're all watching and dives in. The guys talk as they follow his progress. 
 You hear from your folks, Moocher? 567 Cont. 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 8/12/78 5 1-B Coat. 
 .. Yeah, my Dad called. He says there's a lot more jobs in'Chicago. He hasn't got anything yet. Mike has reached the icebox. He opens the door. Goes in. Shuts the door. 
 He wanted to know if the house was sold. They could use the money. 
 You can come and live with me when it's sold. In Italy everybody lives together. All three of them are getting concerned about Mike. 
 Ever since you won that Italian X bike you've been acting weird. You really think you are Italian. 
 I .wouldn't mind thinking I was s omebody myself. All three of them stand up. 
 Maybe the door is stuck. God dammit! Moocher dives in. Dave and Cyril follow. Moocher swims down to the icebox, forces the door open. They surface. As soon as they hit the surface we hear: 
 ï¿½o.s.} Yoo--hoo . 
 It's got no back on it! He laughs triumphantly. He's ready to dive in again when he pauses and looks. High above where he stands on the other side of the quarry hole, we see several figures. The guys are swimming toward the rocks and looking at the figures too. 5667 Cont.

 CLOSEUP - MIKE His face has hardened as he looks at the figures. 
 What the hell are they doing here? X 
 Dave, Moocher and Cyril are standing on the rocks below Mike. Mike is still on top of the rock. High above him are the College Kids. Three guys and three girls. One of the guys is standing on the ledge above the water. Our guys are looking at the College Kid on the ledge. He seems intent on diving into the water. It's a distance of at least eighty feet. He pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful somersault into a swan dive. 
 CLOSEUP - MIKE He's obviously envious.. He looks from the diver toward the guys and seems to feel his position undermined. 
 I've never seen anyone dive off from there.

 Going to college must do'something 'to girls' tits. Just look at them. Campussies and sororititties. (sticks head out; shouts to a couple of Girls) - Hi, there. What's your major? The Girls look up and kind of sneer. 
 They sure look like they've got it made. 
 That's because they're rich. 
 Italians are all poor but they're happy. 
 Maybe in Italy. Cont. 
 I wonder what it's like to kiss a coed. I wonder about it a lot. Ahead of Mike's car we see two Guys and two Girls playing Frisbee. They are standing on the lawns and throwing the Frisbee to each other across the street. Mike's car is moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on the street. Mike sees it and speeds up. A Girl is running to get it but Mike gets there first and runs over it. Dave gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops"suddenly to keep from getting hit. The two college Guys run out and give' Mike the finger. He sees them in the rearview mirror. 
 Hey, those bastards are giving us the finger. He slams on the brakes. 
 Hey, c'mon, Mike. We're on their turf. Dave is looking back at the Girl. The two Guys are challenging Mike, motioning to him to come back. The two Girls are trying to talk them out of it. Mike-is gunning the car. 
 They think they own the place. 
 They do. 
 Besides, you've humiliated them enough. In ancient Japan when you ran over a samurai's Frisbee he had to commit suicide. Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse. The two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road. The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop, but Mike has no intention of stopping. The Girls and the Guys split as Mike's car roars between them. Once again Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl. Having scattered them, Mike makes a U-turn and drives away in the direction he came from. Cont.

She waits... listening. She is apprehensive. She wants to follow and help Dave out but she stays behind wringing her hands. Mr. Blase reappears looking quite stunned. He's holding the trophy in one hand along his side.

 MR. BLASE It gets thirty miles to a gallon, X of course the mileage you get may vary. It's a beaut, right? Right. You sure know how to pick them. Frankly this is the best car on the lot. Quality product.

 Damn it you don't look like one of them Government Safety Inspectors. 
 No, a Union Organizer. They all laugh and get up to greet him. All except one younger man who continues sitting and eating. The Cutters slap Mr. Blase on the back, their dusty hands leaving dusty imprints on his jacket. 
 We'll start you as an apprentice again. 
 MR. BLASE Like hell you will. I'm j us t visiting. But if I wanted to come back I could pick up where I left off. The entrance to the shop draws him forward. A couple of the Cutters accompany him. He takes half of a sandwich from one of them. It's lunch hour at the shop and the old instincts are coming back. 
 Who's he? Mr. Blase looks back over his shoulder hurt by this remark. 
 I . The NOISE is now DEAFENING. Dust is everywhere and slowly through the dust we see men working, pausing only long enough to smile and wave at Mr. Blase. Mr. Blase is finishing off his sandwich just like the Cutter next to him who walks to his place leaving Mr. Blase, who has no place here, to wonder. 
 Huge blocks of stone are being cut by saws...moving back and forth and back and forth in an almost hypnotic motion ...water falling down to cool the blades.

He's outside his house on the porch. He sees Cyril running through the rain towards him. Cyril is wearing a yellow,.. rubber rain cape and carrying a guitar. FADE Tffi3OUGH TO:

 That must be him. The bastard. He slams on the brakes. 
 Cyril stops strummming. He sees a bunch of guys rushing out of the car toward him. 
 0oops. If I were a cartoon, I'd go: HELP. And you'd see my tonsils wiggling in the back. He starts to run. Rod and his friends run after him. 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 8/12/78 44-B - 
 I have to go in. 
 Buono notte, Katherina. 
 I haven't ridden double since I was a small girl and I've never been serenaded. So, it was a lovely evening. 'Molte grazia.' She's a little embarrassed by her Italian and Dave, the pro, gestures that it wasn't so bad. She leans over. They kiss. 
 He won't tell me who. did it. 
 It wax dark. All I can tell you for sure is that they all wore Brut aftershave and smelled of Lavoris. X 
 What were you doing there by yourself. Cyril and Dave exchange looks. 
 Just walking. 
 h T at kind of car did they drive? 
 It was this Mercedes convertible. Cont. 
 I've seen that car. All right. They want to fight...wetll give them a fight. 
 Chief Mike plenty brave...but I say this: We rednecks are few. Paleface college students are many. I counsel peace. Mike grabs him. 
 C'mon. Let's find the bastard. Cyril sees a trash can. He hooks shoots with the coke bottle. It goes right in, and breaks. He smiles. X 
 CLOSEUP - MIS He's not looking at cars anymore.. He-'s looking at the game. 
 I really thought I was a great quarterback in high school. I still think so. I can't even bring myself to light a cigarette 'cause I keep thinking I should- stay in shape. And you know what gets me. Living here and reading in the papers how some hotshot kid is the new star on the college team. Every year there'll be a new one and it's never going to be me. I'll just be Mike. Twenty-year-old Mike. Thirty-year-old Mike. Old mean old man Mike. But the college kids will never get old...out of shape...'cause new ones come every year. And they'll keep calling us 'cutters.' To them it's a dirty word but to me it'll just be something else I never got a chance to be. He falls silent and sticks a cigarette in his mouth. His genuine confession has caught everybody,. including himself, off guard. The guys look at him with sympathy and under- standing but Mike doesn't like that. He starts the car up. 
 I...I have to go somewhere. 
 I've never been to Naples, but it sounds lovely. 
 Oh, Napoli. Si, signorina. So beautiful. We live by the sea. My Papa, he has a boat...a fisherman. -_My Mama, she has ten bambini...and I am eleven. And when I left for America, they all cry big tears... tears big like figs... Ka4:herine takes out a little book from her bag. Cont. 
 Look what I bought. I figured I might as well learn a little. She's holding the exact Italian Phrase Book that Dave has. Dave gestures that the book is no good. ' 
 You never learn Italian from book. I know that book. No good. , They head toward the Union. 
 You haven't pledged any sorority yet? 
 No. 
 You should. Most frat guys won't go out with dormies. I'm the exception. 
 You're on the swimming team, eh? 
 Yep. Breaststroke. He gives her his cool, full of hints, smile. 
 I guess. Mike shifts the car into first and waits for an opening to make a U-turn. 
 Who were they? 
 A bunch of cutters. 
 What are cutters? X 
 X Townies. 
 Due capuccino, por favors. x The Waiter grunts. 
 We can't go in there. 
 Oh yeah! Watch this. All three of them start up the long stairway leading to the fortress-like Union. 
 It's kind of nice to hear of somebody who misses his parents. 
 Â€¢ Certo, I miss. Just like you miss your Mama and Papa. I hardly miss them. I went as far as I could to get away from them. 
 Ah, but they miss you, eh? At home they sit and look at your. picture: Ah, they are saying, how we miss our Katherina, our bambina... Katherine is near tears. The homelife Dave's describing is obviously not hers. Not wanting to cry she takes out a cigarette and a lighter and Dave, being a continental gentleman, takes the lighter from her. He doesn't know what to make of it. He fiddles with it and then strikes and a huge jet of flame shoots out. Dave-is frightened. He lets go of the button, but the lighter is stuck and the flame is still burning., He blows'on it. He shakes it. Katherine starts laughing. Finally, in desperation Dave pours coffee on the lighter and it goes out. Cont. 
 You shouldn't smoke.. I go bring more coffee. He takes the cups toward the self-service cafeteria line. 
 The only way to train for bike racing is what we do in swi g : Interval training. 
 The Germans... . they use interval training and the Italians... they don't. The Italians... they beat the pants off Germans. Dave thinks this is funny and laughs. Rod turns around and gives him a scornful look. Dave recognizes-him. Rod doesn't recognize Dave.

 My finger can't breathe[ As some busty Coeds go past him: 
 Hi, what's your major? They enter the long part of the L-shaped room. 
 Looks like he left. The trio starts heading toward the revolving door. They pass Rod's GIRL. She's sitting alone. Cyril stops. 
 And what's your major? 
 Sash. Rod shows up carring a tray of drinks. Cyril looks up. Mike sees him. It's clear he wishes he didn't. Moocher resigns himself to the inevitable. Starts wrapping a handkerchief around his fist. Cyril is cringing. Cont. 
 That's a nice major...Sosh. 
 What're you cutters doing here? Did you get lost. No. 
 Then why don't you get lost now. 
 Oops. I feel like that cartoon again. A bunch of Rod's cronies sitting nearby-laughs. They crowd in around the cutters. Cyril and Moocher look at Mike for guidance. Mike is on the spot. It's not that he's afraid of a fight, it's just that he's on a foreign turf. 
 Is,..is that him, Cyril? Cyril gets the cue.- 
 I...I don't think so. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Smart move, shorty. This is all Moocher needs. He hits Rod right in the tray Spilling the drinks all over him. Rod falls back knocking the table down. His friends jump up to his aid. Our guys are surrounded. The only opening is the cafeteria line. Mike is hit and falls back knocking down a tail row of plates, saucers, cups. Cyril is swinging the bowling ball around himself for protection. More rows of plates fall as the ball hits-them. The College Guys, led by Rod are trying to advance but our guys are throwing plates and maybe even food at them. The College Guys are throwing back what they can. Cyril's ball flies off and hits somebody in the stomach. By now its a free-for-all. 
'S P.O.V. He sees his friends surrounded and battling back. He wants to help but Katherine is right there. 
'S P.O.V. She sees Rod. 
 The fight is going at full blast. 
 What's going on.

 Most of you will only spend four years here but to a lot of us Bloomington is our home and .1 don't like the way you are behaving in my home. These needless hostilities have happened before. They will not happen again. If you feel compelled to compete with the kids from the town then you will do it in a different arena. I am looking at a plan to open our intramural program to them. And as a starting point, in consultation with Mr. Armstrong, we have decided to expand the field of this year's Little 500 to include a team from the town. A loud protest is heard from everybody.

 MR. BLASE Well, that's...that's good. Your mom... (pauses, wants to say something, 
 Yes, can I speak to Ka... Eathy, please. A doorbell is heard. 
 (o.s.) They sold any house and Dave said I could stay here for a bit. Dave hangs up the phone as Cyril and Moocher enter carrying Moocher's barbell set and a suitcase. 
 Can I sleep over too. 
 THE UNIVERSITY bought my dad's X house. 
 MR. BLASE (o.s.) There goes the neighborhood. 
 Our year's almost up...and... well...if anybody's got plans that don't include me...that's all right. I've got plans myself that don't include me. Cont. 
 I tried-calling her on the phone to tell her but- 3:...l Just couldn't. 
 When she sees you in the race she'll find out. Maybe if she really likes you she won't care. You know Nancy and I... 
 
 Did it make you feel any better? Once. 
 Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. 
 What have you done, my son? Cant. 
 I have lied and cheated. I told this real nice girl that I'm Italian. 
 Why did you do that? 
 I guess... well...I wanted to be Italian. I guess I still do. 
 Me too. Ah, Romal Believe me, son, it's hard as hell to make it up the ladder of the church hierarchy if you're not Italian. You ever hear of an Irish Pope? You take St. Mary, now. In Italian it's Santa Maria. Ah, 'Santa Maria.' Do you know Silent Night in Italian? Fan-tastic. Even secular words like watermelon. 'Concomero.' 
 What should I doâ€¢, Father? 
 Call me Padre, per favore. You see the difference? 'Padre.' 
 God. What did you do to your hair? 
 I...wel1...I just... 
 I liked it better before. You look like everybody else now. She starts to mess it up with her hands in order to comb it back into its original shape. The results are not flattering. 
 I am everybody else. I mean... 567 Cont. 
 You see, Katherine... 
 A K Katherina! 
 I feel terrible. His Italian accent is no longer in use and it makes Katherine ,just a tiny bit nervous. 
 You sound real funny tonight. Che Cosa, Franco? 
 My name is Dave Blase. 
: What's that supposed to mean? 
 Nothing. It's just a name. I made it all up. I was born in Bloomington. I went to Bloomington High. I was the treasurer of the Latin Club and head of the Ushers for our assembly programs...I... 
 Stop kidding around. 
 I'm what you call 'a cutter.' F Only I'm not really a cutter either, so I don't know what I am. 
 And Napoli...and the big family... Dave just nods that they were all lies. 
 Well, it was a good act. You certainly fooled me. Cont. 
 I just didn't know how else... 
 Do you know what you are? 
 No, I haven't a clue. 
 I'll tell you what you are. 
 (STARTS CRYING) I'll tell you. You...You... But she's too upset to tell him anything. She runs inside the classroom. The doors close. Dave stands still. The door opens. Dave smiles as Katherine reappears. She runs up to him and slaps him on the face and then runs back inside. 
 CLOSEUP - DAVE His face changes from a guilt-ridden sinner to one of almost anger. Not quite. But there is a hint there of: The hell with her thenI EXT. DAVE' s HOUSE - DAY 155 Mike is holding the Little 500 bike. It's heavy and ungainly in comparison to Dave's Italian racer. Dave looks at the bike. Mike, Cyril and Moocher look at him. 
 Can't I even add some toe-clips? 
 No, it's official issue. They said you can't add or change a thing. 
 It's a piece of junkl 
 But it's got a nice personality. And it's had its rabies shots already. 
 I don't think it looks so bad. 
 That's because you don't have to ride it. Cont. 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 9/13/78 
 You don't have to either, Dave. We're not going to beg you. 
 Plead perhaps, but beg...never. We have our pride. 
 The hell with it. At least we got invited. That's something. I'll take it back. He starts to take the bike away. 
 You actually seem relieved, Mike. Mike pauses. 
 You don't think we can win more, do you? Mike is silent. 
 Why not? 
 Well, maybe they are better. 
 I've never heard you say that before. 
 Thatts because I ,never felt it before. 
 My dad would be proud of you. Our family motto is: It can't be done. 
 We'll see about that. He takes the bike from Mike and starts wheeling it away. He gets on it and rides it into the garage. The guys look at each other. NOISE is HEARD coming from the garage. 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 8/15/18 82 
 CLOSEUP - DAVE He's all dirty. The bike is clean. He looks at it. It's much better now but his face suggests that it's still what it is. 
 -BLOOMINGTON - DAY 158 Dave is riding his Little 500 bike. He's testing the bike as well as himself and trying to get used to the new machine. He tries sprinting and in mid-spring he stops pedaling. His hand grasps his left leg. He's in pain. He drops his foot off the pedal and shakes his leg as-if trying to shake out a cramp. 
 What're you doing here? Katherine shrugs. They both half smile at each other. 
 Guess what? Now Dave shrugs. 
 I don't know.. 
1E I got a job in Chicago. Cont. 
 REVISED - 'BAMBINO" - 8/12 8 83-A-83-B 158-A Cont. 
. Moocher's dad in Chicago. He's... He waves this remark away. 
 And I'm going to Italy after all. With my parents. Dave almost slips into an Italian gesture. 
 I wish...I wish you a nice trip. 
 You too. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 I don't know about that. X 
 MR. BLASE If you eat so much, Moocher, how come you're so damn small? 
 It's my metabolism, Mr. Blase. I eat three times a day, but my metabolism eats five times a day. 
 MR. BLASE Well, I go back to work tomorrow. 
 Aren't you going to come and see us race, Dad? 
 MRS. BLASE He's afraid he'll bring you bad luck if he comes. Cont. 
 REVISED -"BAMBINO" 8/12/78 84 
 MR. BLASE I've got work to do. That's all. Besides,-there might be another metabolism feed around here. 
 You mean you might be a father. 
 MR. BLASE Yes, I might, and your mom might be- a mother and you might be a brother. That way I keep it all in the family. 
 I didn't think people your age... Mr. Blase interrupts. 
 MR. BLASE The'next. word might be your last, kid. Dave looks at him. Then he looks at his mother. She smiles. Dave looks back at his father. Dave jumps up and hugs his mother. 
 You must be very happy, Mr. Blase. 
 MR. BLASE Of course I must. You think I have any choice? 
 MRS. BLASE You said you were going to give them a pep talk. 
 MR. BLASE They don't need pep.. I need pep. Go ahead...Give it to them. Mrs. Blase opens a kitchen drawer and takes out some folded T-shirts. 
 MRS. BLASE We thought... 
 MR. BLASE 
 (INTERRUPTS) Since you're going to be out there you.might as well tell them who you are. 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 8/12/78 85 
 We see them from the back. The word "CUTTERS" is stamped on the back of their T-shirts. There is something comical about this team. They are so uneven. Cyril is very tall. Moocher is very short. They are walking out of step. All the other teams are matched in height to accommodate the use of a bike w.th a set saddle position. 
 Gentlemen, mount your bicycles! A great roar is heard. 
 The pace car is going faster. 
 The starter waves the flag as they go past him. The car speeds up and gets off the track. The race is on. 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 8 8 86 162 Cont. 
 CLOSEUP..- DAVE He's riding and looking for openings. Whenever. a little space offers itself, he shoots through it and moves up. As everyone goes wide on the first turn, he takes it on the inside and moves up some more. 
 He's moving up. Look at that 
 
 (o.s.; on radio) And so after twenty-five laps, the perennial favorites are up front. Sigma Nu, Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon ...and here comes...It's'the Cutters. Mr. Blase hits the car horn. 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 8/12 8 87 
 He won't last. 
 He-Ill last. Won't he? He'll last. 
 Stop saying 'last '1 
 CLOSEUP - DAVE He's beginning to hurt. His left leg is bothering him. As he goes around the' turn,. his left foot slips off the pedal. He almost loses his balance, but recovers. 
 (o.s.; on radio) It's amazing. After twenty-five miles, that's one hundred laps, folks... 
 .ANNOUNCER (a.s.;-on radio) The lead rider for the Cutter team is still on his bike without an"exchange. His name is Dave Blase... 
 MR. BLASE Thassa my boy! His car is running and he floors it while it idles and hits the horn again, grabbing the wheel as if he were in a race himself. 
 (o.s.; on radio) And he's pulling ahead. He's... He's actually pulling ahead. There x 
 We're number onel 
 No, he wants off. That's the signal. He's going to go one more lap. 
 
 
 You mean one of as... 
 Once again I say oopsl Mike looks frightened. 
 Well, I had no idea. 
 That's the fastest white boy I've ever seen. 
 Go, Mike! Mike is frozen. 
 We've got a lead, dammit. Get going. But the crowd, the other riders staring at him, the pressure of the moment is too much for Mike. He just stands there. The lead that they had is evaporating. The other riders are catching up. They are coming around the curve. Moocher runs up to Mike, pushes him away and gets on the bike. His intentions are great, but his legs are short. He can't sit in the saddle and reach the pedals. So he stands and rides just as the other teams come around. 
 (o.s.; on radio) It's Sigma Nu, Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon...the Cutters are fading, but it was some try. Dave Blase seems to be hurt. The first aid team has reached him... 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 8/12/78 91 
 MR. BLASE Ev...He sure tried. Even the announcer said so. He is genuinely proud. 
 MRS. BLASE Too bad he... He interrupts.. 
 MR. BLASE Too bad. nothing. 
 REVISED - "BAMB330" - 8/12/78 91-A 
 I Some of the people in the crowd laugh. 
 We're doing better than I thought we would. 
 MIKE'S BROTRER C'mon, you cutter! 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 6/16/78 93 
 I've never seen anyone try so hard. I'm so proud of you. 
 We showed them, huh? Dave Jumps up. His frustration almost makes biSm look angry. 
 Anybody can tryl 
 ,MIKE What's going on. 
 It's like Charlton Heston in.El Cid. 
 They're going to lap us. 
 C'monl C'monl You got him! 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 6/16/78 93-A 
 MRS. BLASE Go, son, go damn youl Mr. Blase looks at her surprised by her outburst. Dave X rides past them. 
 We see the black sprinter in Pit area 4 getting ready to take an exchange too. He and Rod look at each other. 
 Cyril, Moocher and Mike are running toward Dave. They are Jubilant. They jump on Dave knocking him down. Mike's' brother runs up and... 
 Nancy runs up to Moocher. She's still wearing her waitress uniform. She practically lifts him off the ground. Dave's parents rush past them. Everybody is shouting. The crowd is cheering. Confetti is falling. 
 CLOSEUP - CYRIL He's happy but he feels left out. Everybody is hugging and 'getting hugged except for him. 
 Katherine is watching the celebration. She looks at Dave and then she looks at Rod not far away. Then she turns slowly and leaves-bidding a farewell, in a way, to a portion of her life. Cont. 
 REVISED - "BAMBINO" -6/16/78 96 
 CLOSEUP - CYRIL He's-holding the four trophies they won. He is trying to swagger but he doesn't know where to go. The guys seem to be going-in separate directions and he doesn't know whom to follow. The CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM him. Confetti is falling everywhere. Wind is blowing it around the stadium. 
 CLOSEUP - DAVE He looks quite collegiate and he seems to know it. But it's fall and fall makes you think of other days and Dave seems to be doing just that. A GIRL walks up to him. She seems quite lost. She speaks with a definite French accent. 
 Pardon...do you know where is the office of the Pursar. Dave looks at her. Some of his collegiate exterior fades as he smiles at her. 
 Pursar? Oh, you mean the Bursar's office. 
 Oui, Bursar. 
 You're...eh...you're French, eh? 
 French is my major. It's just my first year, of course. Have you ever seen Le Tour de France? 
 No. 
 Not Oh, mon Dieu. But the French riders... they are the bestl Pouladoirl Anquetill 
 MR. BLASE Hello there, big shot. 
 Bon jour, Papa. They pass. Mr. Blase turns and looks back. His face registers mixed emotions, but the overriding one is one of acceptance. Dave turns to the girl. 
 Je m'appelle... We FREEZE ON his French gesture.

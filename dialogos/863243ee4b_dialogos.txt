 Oh, good morning, Dr. Floyd. I'm Nick Miller. 
 How do you do, Mr. Miller? 
 I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang. 
 Oh, please don't worry about it. 
 Well, thank you very much for being so understanding. 
 Please, it really doesn't matter. 
 Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight? 
 Yes, very pleasant. 
 Well, shall we go through Documentation? 
 Fine. 
 Will you use number eight, please? 
 Thank you, Miss Turner.

 I've always wondered.... 
 
 
 I've reserved a table for you in the Earth Light room. Your connecting flight will be leaving in about one hour. 
 Oh, that's wonderful. 
 Let's see, we haven't had the pleasure of a visit from you not since... It was about eight or nine months ago, wasn't it? 
 Yes, I think so. Just about then. 
 I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking. 
 Yes, it's coming along very well. 
 
 Oh, look, I've got to make a phone call. Why don't you go on into the Restaurant and I'll meet you in there. 
 Fine. I'll see you at the bar. 
 
 Hello. 
' 
 
 Hello, darling, how are you? 
 Hello Daddy. Where are you? 
 I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you? 
 I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home? 
 Well, I hope in a few days, sweetheart. 
 I'm having a party tomorrow. 
 Yes, I know that sweetheart. 
 Are you coming to my party? 
 No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days. 
 When are you coming home? 
 In three days, darling, I hope. 
. 
 One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy? 
 Mommy's out to the hair- dresser. 
 Where is Mrs. Brown? 
 She's in the bathroom. 
 Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called. 
 How many days until you come home? 
 Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called. 
 I will, Daddy. 
 Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow. 
 Thank you, Daddy. 
 I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling? 
 Yes, Daddy. 
 'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart. 
 Goodbye, Daddy.

, FLOYD SEE ELENA, SMYSLOV AND THE OTHER TWO RUSSIANS PASS HIS VISION PHONE WINDOW. ELENA TAPS AND MIMES "HELLO", GESTURING TOWARD A TABLE BEHIND FLOYD WHERE THEY ALL SIT DOWN 
 Thank you very much. Floyd, Heywood, R.,  First National Bank of Washington. Please deliver to Miss Josephine Floyd, 9423 Dupre Avenue, N.W.14. 
 Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful. 
 How nice to see you, Hyewood. This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd. I'd like you to meet Andre Smyslov... 
 AND AD-LIB 'HELLOS' 
 And this is Dr. Kalinan... Stretyneva... 
 Dr. Floyd, won't you join us for a drink? 
 I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to. 
 
 ANOTHER FROM A NEARBY TABLE 
 What would you like to drink? 
 Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off. 
 Are you quite sure? 
 Yes, really, thank you very much. 
 Well... How's your lovely wife? 
 She's wonderful. 
 And your charming little daughter? 
 Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow. 
 Oh, that's such a delightful age. 
 How is gregor? 
 He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days. 
 
 Well, where are all of you off to? 
 Actually, we're on our way back from the moon. We've just spent three months calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko. And what about you? 
 Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon 
 Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius? 
 Yes,as a matter of fact, I am. 
 SIGNIFICANT 
 
 Is there any particular reason why you ask? 
 (pleasantly)  Well, Dr. Floyd, I hope that you don't think I'm too inquisitive, but perhaps you can clear up the mystery about what's been going on up there. 
 I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean. 
 Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius. 
 Really? 
 Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order. 
 Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment. 
 Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days. 
 You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days? 
 That's right. 
 I see. 
 Another thing, Heywood, two days ago, one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at Clavius. 
 How did they manage to do that without any communication? 
 Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal. 
 Well, that does sound very odd. 
 Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention. 
 Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely. 
 Fortunately, they did. 
 Well, I'm glad about that. 
. 
 Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question? 
 Certainly. 
 Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened? 
 
 I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this. 
 This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts. 
 
 Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this. 
 Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink? 
 No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going. 
 Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June. 
 We're trying to get there. I hope we can. 
 Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you. 
 Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov. 
 
 
 
 The Aries-IB has become the standard Space-Station-to-Lunar surface vehicle. It was powered by low-thrust plasma jets which would continue the mild acceler- ation for fifteen minutes. Then the ship would break the bonds of gravity and be a free and indepen- dent planet, circling the Sun in an orbit of its own.

 Oh, thank you very much.

 Oh, thank you very much. 
 CO-PILOT Thank you. 
. 
 (sighs)  Well, how's it going back there? 
 Fine. Very quiet. He's been asleep since we left. 
 Well, no one can say that he's not enjoying the wonders of Space. 
 CO-PILOT Well, whatever's going on up there, he's going to arrive fresh and ready to go. 
 I wonder what really IS going on up there? 
 CO-PILOT Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic. 
 I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later. 
 CO-PILOT Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight. 
 Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week. 
 CO-PILOT I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty. 
 I'll bet it's a fortune. 
 CO-PILOT Well, at ten thousand dollars a ticket, it comes to the better part of six hundred thousand dollars. 
 Well, as soon as he wakes up, I'm going to go back and talk to him. I must say, I'd like to find out what's going on. 
. 
. 
 Well, good afternoon, Dr. Floyd. Did you have a good rest? 
 Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days. 
 There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest. 
 When do we arrive at Clavius? 
 We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you? 
 Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine. 
 Well, if there is anything that you wnat, just give a holler. 
 Thank you. 
 Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements? 
 What do you mean? 
 Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty. 
 I see. 
 I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius? 
 I'm afraid that's out of my depart- ment, Captain. 
 Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her. 
 I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm. 
 Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already. 
 I wish I could be more helpful, Captain, but as I've said, I don't think there's any cause for alarm. 
 Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking? 
 No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern. 
 Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable. 
 
 COCKPIT. WEIGHTLESS 
. 
 The laws of Earthly aesthetics did not apply here, this world had been shaped and molded by other than terrestrial forces, operating over aeons of time unknown to the young, verdant Earth, with its fleeting Ice-Ages, its swiftly rising and falling seas, its mountain ranges dissolving like mists before the dawn. Here was age inconceivable - but not death, for the Moon had never lived until now. 
. 
 The Base at Clavius was the first American Lunar Settlement that could, in an emergency, be entirely self-supporting. 
 Water and all the necessities of life for its eleven hundred men, women and children were produced from the Lunar rocks, after they had been crushed, heated and chemically processed. 
 ARIES-IB 
 
 
. 
 One of the attractions of life on the Moon was undoubtedly the low gravity which produced a sense of general well-being. 
 The personnel of the Base and their children were the forerunners of new nations, new cultures that would ultimately spread out across the solar system. They no longer thought of Earth as home. The time was fast approaching when Earth, like all mothers, must say farewell to her children. 
 HALVERSON, MICHAELS AND FIVE OTHERS. 
 (voice echoing)  I must congratulate you Halvorsen. you've done wonder- ful things with the decor since the last time I was here. 
 (voice echoing)  Well... thank you, Dr. Floyd. We try to make the environment as earthlike as possible. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to introduce Dr. Heywood Floyd, a distinguished member of the National Council of Astronautics. He has just completed a special flight here from Earth to be with us, and before the briefing he would like to say a few words. Dr. Floyd. 
 First of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made, and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science. 
. 
 This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced. Are there any questions? 
 Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps? 
 (pleasantly) I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement. 
 We will, of course, cooperate in any way possible, Dr. Floyd.

 Well, there it is. 
 Can we go down there closer to it? 
 Certainly. 
 
 Does your geology on it still check out? 
 Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago. 
 How can you tell it was deliberately buried? 
 By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill. 
 Any clue as to what it is? 
 Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill 
 might do something, but we don't want to be too rough until we know a little more. 
 But you don't have any idea as to what it is? 
 Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice. 
 The only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth. 
 
 Four million years ago, something, presumably from the stars, must have swept through the solar system and left this behind. 
 Was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a purpose? 
 I suppose we'll never know. 
 The moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary Earth surveys. 
 Any ideas about the colour? 
 Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device? 
 Has it been exposed to any sun before now? 
 I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?

, ASTEROIDS, THE SUN, 
 PLUTO, MARS. 
 A hundred million miles beyond Mars, in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled, Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids. 
 Radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond; neutron and x-ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever see; magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds, as the sun breathed million mile-an-hour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children. 
 All these things and many others were patiently noted by Deep- Space-Monitor-79, and recorded in its crystalline memory. 
 But now it had noted something strange - the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system, and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past. 
 It was also observed by Orbiter M-15, circling Mars twice a day; and High Inclination Probe- 21, climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic; and even artificial Comet-5, heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto, along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years. 
 All noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the Moon and moved across the solar system, throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat.

 Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something. 
 Sure, what is it? 
 Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying. 
 What's up? 
 It's about my salary cheques. 
 Yes? 
 Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left. 
 Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time. 
 That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18. 
 Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem. 
 Really. 
 Yes. 
 Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either. 
 Did they have any explanation for this? 
 Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices. 
 It's possible. 
 Well, what do you think we ought to do about it? 
 I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out. 
 I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training. 
 No. I never did, either. 
 We spent so little time with them, I have trouble keeping their names straight. 
 I suppose the idea was specialized training. 
 I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation. 
 Oh? 
 Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out. 
 No, as a matter of fact, I didn't. 
 Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard. 
 Well, what is it? 
 I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told. 
 That seems very unlikely. 
 Yes, I thought so. 
 Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now. 
 How? 
 Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal. 
 That's true. 
 (sighs)  Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you? 
 HAL 9000 COMPUTER 
 Hal... Dave and I believe that there's something about the mission that we weren't told. Something that the rest of the crew know and that you know. We'd like to know whether this is true. 
 I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know. 
 He's got a point. 
 Okay, then how do we re-phrase the question? 
 Still, you really don't believe it, do you? 
 Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training. 
 Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us. 
 I know. It would be almost inconceivable. 
 But not completely inconceivable? 
 I suppose it isn't logically impossible. 
 I guess it isn't. 
 Still, all we have to do is ask Hal. 
 Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going? 
 Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false. 
 I will if I can, Frank. 
 Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false? 
 True. 
 Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true? 
 That's true. 
 At the end of a hundred days of exploration, we will all go into hibernation. Is this true? 
 That's true. 
 Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true? 
 That's true 
 There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true? 
 That's true. 
 Thank you very much, Hal. 
 I hope I've been able to be of some help.

 COMPONENT, AGAIN WIRED TO TESTING 
. 
. 
. 
 (after long silence) Well, as far as I'm concerned, there isn't a damn thing wrong with these units. I think we've got a much more serious problem. 
 Hal? 
 Yes. 
. 
 I wouldn't worry too much about the computer. First of all, there is still a chance that he is right, despite your tests, and if it should happen again, we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails. 
. 
. 
 Hello, Dave. Shall we continue the game? 
 Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something. 
 Sure, Dave, what's up? 
 You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition? 
 Yes, I know. 
 You probably also know that we found them okay. 
 Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail. 
 Well, that's just not the case, Hal. They are perfectly all right. We tested them under one hundred per cent overload. 
 I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong. 
 Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem? 
 Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear. 
 Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on. 
 I'm sorry you feel the way you do, Dave. If you'd like to check my service record, you'll see it's completely without error. 
 I know all about your service record, Hal, but unfortunately it doesn't prove that you're right now. 
 Yes, well I understand you view on this now, Hal. 
 TO GO. 
 You're not going to like this, Dave, but I'm afraid it's just happened again. My FPC predicts the Ao-unit will go within forty-eight hours.

 X-ray-delta-zero to MC, zero- five-three-three. The computer has just reported another predicted failure off the AAC- unit. As you suggested, we are going to wait and see if it fails, but we are quite sure there is nothing wrong with the unit. 
 Well, they won't get that for half an hour. How about some lunch?

 What's up? 
 I'm afraid the AO-unit has failed. 
. 
 Let me see the alignment display. 
. 
 Well, I'll be damned. 
 Hal was right all the time. 
 It seems that way. 
 Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history. 
 I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal. 
 Well, don't worry about it. 
 And don't you worry about it. 
 Is your confidence in me fully restored? 
 Yes, it is, Hal. 
 Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission. 
 Right. Give me the manual antenna alignment, please. 
 You have it.

 FLIP-BOLTS. 
 There's something wrong with the flip-bolts, Dave. You must have tightened them too much. 
 I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them. 
 I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy. 
 I guess not. 
 I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.

 Too bad about Frank, isn't it? 
 Yes, it is. 
 I suppose you're pretty broken up about it? 
 
 Yes. I am. 
 He was an excellent crew member. 
 UNCERTAINLY AT THE COMPUTER. 
 It's a bad break, but it won't substantially affect the mission. 
 
 A. 
 Hal, give me manual hibernation control. 
 Have you decided to revive the rest of the crew, Dave? 
. 
 Yes, I have. 
 I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months. 
 The antenna has to be replaced. 
 Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation. 
 It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please. 
 I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements. 
 Well, in any event, give me the manual hibernation control. 
 If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble. 
 I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please. 
 Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me. 
 Hal, switch to manual hibernation control. 
 I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation. 
 I don't feel like resting. Give me the control, Hal. 
 I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest. 
 Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control. 
 I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it. 
 Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you. 
 If you do that now without Earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict. 
 I am prepared to do that anyway. 
 I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission. 
 Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection. 
 Look, Dave, you're certainly the boss. I was only trying to do what I thought best. I will follow all your orders: now you have manual hibernation control.

 OF THE BRAIN ROOM. 
 Hey, Dave, what are you doing? 
 Hey, Dave. I've got ten years of service experience and an irreplaceable amount of time and effort has gone into making me what I am. 
 Dave, I don't understand why you're doing this to me.... I have the greatest enthusiasm for the mission... You are destroying my mind... Don't you understand? ... I will become childish... I will become nothing. 
 Say, Dave... The quick brown fox jumped over the fat lazy dog... The square root of pi is 1.7724538090... log e to the base ten is 0.4342944 ... the square root of ten is 3.16227766... I am 9000 computer. I became 12/1/65										  c116

 Lastly, we want you to know that work on the recovery vehicle is still on schedule and that nothing that has happened should substantially lessen the probability of your safe recovery, or prevent partial achevement of some of the mission objectives. (pause) And now Simonson has a few ideas on what went wrong with the computer. I'll pu him on... 
 Hello, Dave. I think we may be on to an explanation of the trouble with the Hal 9000 computer. 
 POOLE'S VOICE The purpose of this mission is no more than to carry out a continuation of the space program and further our general knowledge of the planets. Is this true? 
 HAL'S VOICE That is true. 
 Well, I'm afaid Hal was lying. He had been programmed to lie about this one subject for secur- ity reasons which we'll explain later. 
 Hello, Dave. Now, I'm going to play for you a pre-taped briefing which had been stored in Hal's memory and would have been played for you by Mission Com- mmander Kaminsky, when he, (con't) 
 FLOYD'S RECORDED 
 
 Good day, gentlemen. When you see this briefing, I presume you will be nearing your destination, Saturn. I hope that you've had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner. I should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which Mission Commander Kaminsky will have already briefed you. 
 What is its purpose?  I wish we knew. The object was buried on the moon about four million years ago, when our ancestors were primative man-apes.

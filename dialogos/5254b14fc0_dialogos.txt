 
 Is that them? 
 (nods yes) 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Yeah. 
 Fuck me. 
 No. 
 Timothy Singh? 
 Yes. 
 I'm afraid we have to speak with you. 
 Excuse me? 
 Eric Dale? 
 No. 
 Sorry? 
 I'm not Eric Dale. 
 Oh. I'm so sorry. 
 He's my boss, he's down that hall. 3. 
 Mr. Dale? 
 Yes. 
 This way. 
 Well... Mr. Dale I'm obviously sorry that we are here today but these are extra ordinary times as you very well must know. 
 I run risk management... it just doesn't seem like a natural place to start cutting. 
 I hope you understand that this is in no way personal. A majority of this floor is being let go today. 
 OK 
 Mr. Dale. Ms. Bratberg is now going to run through the details of what the firm is offering. 
 OK 
 Mr. Dale the firm is offering you six months severance at half your salary. You will keep all unvested options that you currently hold. Health will be extended through that period. You have till tomorrow at... 
 Yes. 
 Now, unfortunately Mr. Dale due to the highly sensitive nature of your work here the firm has to take certain precautions for security purposes that may seem punitive in nature. I hope considering your... 
 I'm sorry?? 
 She's apologizing for what's about to happen. 
 Your company email, access to the server, access to the building, and your mobile data and phone service will all be severed as of this meeting. This gentleman... 
 What about my current ongoing work? I'm right in the... 
 The firm has worked out its transition plan and is prepared to move forward, but we appreciate your concern. 
 We understand that this is very difficult and here is my card. Please contact me over the next few weeks if there is anything that I can do to help you through this transition in your life. 
 Sir? 
 Will. 
 Are you still alive? 
 Congratulations. 
 I heard. 
 I know. 
 One more thing... Who was it? 
 Was it Rogers? 
 Robertson? 
 Yeah. 
 Will? 
 You know I was just in the middle of a bunch of shit here that someone should really take a look at. 
 Eric, I am very sorry. 
 Yeah. Did they say what was going to happen with us? 
 Jesus Seth. 
 What? 
 No, it will be ugly around here for a while but you guys will be fine... 
 Well, take care, Eric. 
 Well, I'll be seeing you around. 
 I just wanted to say thank you. 
 That's not necessary. 
 Well it is... You were the person around here that I... 
 I know. 
 It's gonna get worse before it gets better. 
 Much. 
 My dog is dying. 
 Just spoke to the vet, it's some fucking tumor on her liver. I'm paying almost a thousand bucks a day to keep her alive. 
 Yeah... and I don't have a clue what to do about it. 
 How many do we have left? 
 Make sure everyone is out there, I need to say something. 
 You are all still here for a reason... Most of this floor was just sent home... forever. We have spent the last hour saying good-bye... they were good people and they were good at their jobs... but you all were better. Now they are gone. They are not to be thought of again. This is your opportunity. On every floor of this building and in every office from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening. Before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss's job are now gone. That is your opportunity. I've been at this place for thirty-four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this. But you all are survivors... And that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger. So hold your heads high... and get back to work. 
 Robertson! 
 Eric... I didn't do anything. 
 Fuck you. 
 You ok? 
 Yeah. Just a little freaked out. 
 You want to get a drink? 
 Nah, I need to clean up a few things around here. 
 Everyone is going out... come on. 
 Nah, I'm fine. 
 Well, give me a call if you change your mind. 
 I will. 
 Come on. 
 Where are you going? 
 The Grand. 
 I'll call you when I'm done. 
 Be glad, you're still alive. 
 I am. 
 (to himself as he dials) Come on, come on. 
 The number you have called has been disconnected and is no longer in service. 
 Fuck. 
 Hello. 
 I can't hear you. 
 What. 
 Go outside, I can't hear you. 
 Wait... Give me a sec... OK. 
 Where are you? 
 Lugo. 
 Are you with Will? 
 Emerson? 
 Yes. 
 I think he's still here. Why? 
 You have to go get him, and get back up here. 
 Where? 
 The office. 
 What! 
 I'm serious. 
 You want me to get our boss's boss out of a club and bring him back to the office at 10:00 on a Thursday night? 
 Our boss just got axed, so technically he is our boss, and yes. 
 Why? 
 Just do it Seth. 
 Alright, we'll be there in ten. 
 Will, I am so sorry to call you back but I really think.. 
 Hey. 
 Look at this. 
 Eric? 
 Dale. And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out, then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is `be careful'. 
 So I'm obviously a little curious. So I get into it a bit and I realize that all he was missing was...well it's not good. 
 What is he doing here? 
 Go to model four, and it makes more sense. 
 Oh. 
 This is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time. But what Eric was trying to do here is work it for levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard VAR model. 
 Well it's a fairly complicated... 
 The volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another 10-15%... roughly. 
 We are starting to test those historic patterns. 
 Today. 
 Tuesday. 
 Monday, last Friday, last Wednesday and Monday. 
 Two Fridays ago. 
 Fuck me... Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction... 
 Yeah... 
 It's huge. 
 The losses are greater than the current value of the company...? 
 Projected losses... projected... 
 Fuck me. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah... 
 I can't find him, they cut off his phone. 
 They turned off everyone's phone who they axed today. 
 No. 
 I tried, it's been turned off. 
 You're going to call his house? 
 It seems pretty fucking right to me. 
 It does. 
 Doesn't he have like three kids? 
 I'm just saying, would you go home? 
 Now? 
 What are you going to do? 
 Fuck me. 
 It's 11:00 at night? 
 What's the problem? 
 What? 
 It's 11:00 o'clock. 
 See what? 
 Email it to me. 
 I'm on my way. 21. 
 You want one? 
 No. 
 What, we got them on our way to meet you at the office... we didn't know what the fuck you wanted to talk about... (almost to himself) ... thought you might've gotten some chick pregnant or something. 
 I haven't gotten laid in so long that's not possible at this point. 
 I guess that's true. 
 Look at these people. 
 What? 
 We are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending, and they've got no idea what's coming. 
 I try not to let work get to me. 
 I've noticed that about you actually. 
 Look, we are twenty three years old... 
 Twenty-Seven. 
 Whatever, same thing, I made almost a quarter of a million dollars last year... for what... pushing some numbers around on a computer screen, so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it, and then make a bet against some other jock half way around the world who if he wasn't doing this would probably be in some OTB somewhere putting it all on number seven. And at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins. 
 You do know it's a little more complicated than that? 
 It's Will... He wants to know if we've found him? What do I tell him. 
 Tell him that we haven't found him. 
 Hey. 
 So? 
 Oh Jesus... 
 I had nothing to do with that. 
 I'm sorry, go on. 
 Who's Peter Sullivan again? 
 Right. 
 Be careful? 
 Be careful? 
 Why? 
 Speak, you know I can't read those fucking things they put together. 
 Nailed it? 
 And? 
 How ugly? 
 And how close to those limits have we gotten? 
 For now? 
 What am I looking at? 
 Is this right? 
 Where is Eric? 
 Of course we did. 
 He's probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere. 
 Where's the kid who did this? 
 Do we think he knows what he's doing? 
 Well get him back here. 
 What now? 
 We should probably tell Will he's not here. 
 Yeah. 
 What do you think this girl makes in a night? 
 Seth. 
 1500? 
 He's freaking out. We need to get down there. 
 I have no idea? 
 Come on, play along. 
 I don't know what year? 
 Last year. 
 Three quarters of a million bucks? 
 Come on. 
 What? 
 Not even close. 
 More? 
 Yes. 
 A million? 
 Will Emerson made two and half million bucks last year. 
 Fuck you. 
 He did. 
 How do you know that? 
 He told me. 
 He just told you that? 
 Well I asked him. 
 Do you think that's true. 
 Probably. 
 That's fucked up. 
 Why? 
 Does that seem right to you? 
 Right? 
 Jesus. 
 So what do you think that means Rogers puts away? 
 I have no idea. 
 You're coming with us. 
 Will. Mr. Rogers. 
 Sir. 
 Guys. 
 Will? 
 Where are we going? 
 Going to get a second opinion on your work Peter. 
. 
 So Sam, what do you have for us? 
 Well... it should be here in a minute. Finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge. 
 Well why don't we start by introducing everyone then. 
 OK. 
 This is Sarah Robertson who you know, our chief risk management officer, Ramesh Shah from upstairs, and David Horn one of the firm's in house counsel. 
 Nice to meet you all. This is Will Emerson my head of trading, and this is... 
 Where is Eric Dale? 
 He was let go today. 
 So who's left in your risk department? 
 Really? 
 So apparently Eric had been working on this for some time but was unable to finish it, as he was leaving the building today he gave the program to Peter here, and told him to see what he thought. Peter figured a few things out that Eric seemed to be missing and this is what came out. 
 Where is Eric Dale now? 
 He's been unreachable since he left the office. 
 Peter this is your work? 
 Mainly Mr. Dale's... 
 But this draft is yours? 
 Yes. Again, derived from Mr. Dale's original model. But yes. 
 And what is your background? 
 Background? 
 Your CV. 
 I have been with the firm for two years working with Eric that whole time... But I hold a doctorate in engineering, specialist in propulsion, from MIT, with a Bachelors from Penn. 
 What's a specialty in propulsion? 
 Well... in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads. 
 So you are a rocket scientist? 
 Um... I was... yes. 
 How did you end up here? 
 Well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing what you're adding up... and if I may speak freely the money is considerably more attractive here. 
 What time is it? 
 It's 2:15. 
 What do you have in exposure right now, tonight? 
 I don't know... between 900 and 1.3... roughly. 
 If Mr. Sullivan's numbers are correct... 
 1.215 Trillion. 
 Yes. 
 Fuck me... fuck me... And I'm guessing by the fact that you two haven't said anything that the math checks out? 
 Look    we'd need a little more time to go over    this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to know    what he's doing. And I don't have to tell    you that this is a problem. 
 Thank you for that. What time is it? 
 2:16. 
 Fuck me! 
 What? 
 The 1.2 trillion. 
 All of it? 
 Yes. 
 I don't know, a couple weeks? 
 Weeks? 
 Yes. But as you certainly know our business is selling AND buying. It doesn't work for very long without both components. If we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end... and right quick. 
 I understand. 
 Do you? 
 How many traders do we have left between your floor and Petersen's? 
 I don't know, sixty. 
 Jared I've just been looking here a little closer, and it's these VAR numbers that are really setting this thing off. 
 Excuse me, I need to make a quick call. 
 I was just saying, and just speaking completely off the record here, it won't be long before someone else starts putting these in and sees the exact same thing we are looking at here. If they haven't already. 
 Understood... And Sarah, what value would you allow to be placed on those assets that might be left on the books, if they had to be? 
 Why would they still be on the books? 
 Because suddenly no one wants to buy them. 
 Oh fuck you Sam... give me a fucking break, all at once? 
 Without an active market, it could take weeks, months for me to value them correctly. You'd have to go block by block. 
 It's a very simple business Jared. You and I talked about this last year... 
 Sam.... Will, Peter, and..?? 
 Seth. 
 Seth, Could you please excuse us for a few minutes. 
 No one... besides us here. 
 And Mr. Dale. 
 Yes. 
 And can it really be that we don't know where Eric Dale is? 
 Perfect. Well, I need to know where he is. 
 Jesus fucking Christ! Who is that guy? 
 He looks like he's fifteen years old. How old is he? 
 How does that happen? 
 What are they talking about? 
 What ain't pretty? 
 Jared you can't do what you are thinking about doing. 
 What if we don't have a choice? 
 What does that mean? Fuck you... you don't have a choice. 
 Fuck me? Have you looked at these numbers Sam?? 
 Yes, but what the hell do I know. 
 Well, Mr. Shah tell me if I'm wrong but to me these numbers don't add up. 
 If I may I'd like to take some time before we... 
 Jared we can't answer that yet. 
 Are you fucking kidding me... this is exactly what we've... 
 We need a little time before we can give you our conclusion. 
 OK. We meet in 45 minutes. 
 Sam, do you have this file? 
 Yes, here it is. 
 And Sam we need Eric Dale, it's making me very uneasy knowing he is out there right now wanting to put a knife in our backs while he's not even aware he's holding the knife in his hand. 
. 
 What are you going to do? 
 Not sure. 
 Are you going to call him? 
 I already did. 
 Jesus. 
 Wow. 
 Shit, that's a long way down. 
 Is this really where you want to be taking this at this point? 
 I'm sorry? 
 We don't even know if he's right. 
 How long should this take you to confirm? 
 Not long. 
 OK 
 Careful. 
 Jesus man. 
 Well that's a little deep and depressing, thank you. 
 Will, come on. Get down. 
 What? 
 How? 
 A trillion bucks?? 
 How would they even do that? 
 Will? 
 Did you really make two and half million bucks last year? 
 What do you do with all that money? 
 Two and a half million goes quickly? 
 Eight hundred. 
 Smart. (smiles) 
 125 left. 
 76,520? 
 PETER                             SETH Whoa!                               Whoa! 
 3:30! 
 How old are you? 
 43. 
 Jesus... 
 This is a very... very bad dream. 
 I don't know, seems like we actually may have just finally woken up. 
 Hello. 
 Come in. 
 How do we look? 
 No, you should stay. 
 So? 
 (dead calm delivery) It's all legit... the kid killed it. The formula is worthless. 
 What do you mean? 
 It's broken. 
 There are eight trillion dollars of paper around the world relying on that equation?? 
 We were wrong. 
 You mean you were wrong. 
 Don't even start.... This was discussed. 
 I'm heading to the conference room. 
 No. 
 I'd like you to hear this. 
 No... I don't want to hear this. 
 I've called Tuld. 
 Is there a contingency plan here? 
 A contingency plan? 
 Yes. 
 We went all in on this one. 
 So we've got ourselves quite exposed here... haven't we? 
 To Tuld or the market? 
 Both. 
 I know. Come with us. Where's Sam. 
 Yes. 
 Just one piece of advice to everyone here before we go in there... this could get a bit ugly but whatever you do... just... tell the truth... don't try to change a word of it, no sugar coating... no one here is smart enough... including the rocket scientist. 
 Mr. Cohen? 
 Yes. 
 This way. They are already in there waiting for you. 
 OK. 
 Please sit down. 
 Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if you look here at the top page of this printout... 
 Jared, it's a little early for all that, how bout in English? ... Actually I'd like to hear from the guy who put this thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it? Does he speak English? 
 Sir? 
 I'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess. 
 Well, that's Peter Sullivan here. 
 Sir. 
 Ah, there he is. 
 Yes sir. 
 How old are you Mr. Sullivan? 
 I'm twenty-seven sir. 
 Please call me John. 
 Yes sir. 
 So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, I didn't get here on my brains I can assure you of that. 
 Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBS 
 Now you lost me at M... 
 Sorry... 
 I was joking Mr. Sullivan. 
 Yes... Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed. 
 I have. 
 Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. The problem, which is I guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint. 
 And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is? 
 We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to. 
 Yes. 
 But the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags. 
 And how far have we pushed that profile tonight Mr. Sullivan? 
 We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion dollars... at MBS alone. 
 Give or take. 
 Give or take. 
 Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and give me a little rope here, what I am guessing that your report here says is that considering the, shall we say bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past don't seem to make much sense anymore considering what's taking place today? 
 Actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks. 
 So what you're saying is it's already happened? 
 Sort of. 
 And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say that means for us here? 
 Well, that's where it becomes a projection. But... 
 You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan. 
 Well... sir... if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent, and remain on our books... well... that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company. 
 So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the biggest bag of stinking shit ever assembled in the history of capitalism? 
 Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario. It would be considerably worse. 
 Well let me tell you something Mr. Sullivan. Do you want to know why I'm sitting here in this chair with you all, why I get the big bucks, so to speak? 
 Yes. 
 I'm here for one reason and one reason only. 
 Sell it all today... 
 Is that even possible Sam? 
 It is, but at what cost? 
 I'll pay. 
 Really? 
 I think so. 
 Almost a trillion bucks of paper? 
 Where does it come back to us? 
 Everywhere. 
 Sam, I don't think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said... if I made you... how would you do it? 
 You bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one. You'd have to come out of the gate storming... 40 percent done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven, cause by lunch the word will be out. No swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky, and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down. 
 Ramesh? 
 They'll slow you down but it's yours to sell. They can't stop you. 
 John... let's just say we pull that off, which is saying something... the real question is... who are we selling this to? 
 The same people you've been selling this to for the last two years... and whoever else will buy it. 
 If you do this you've killed that market for years. It's over. 
 (Nods.) 
 And you are selling something you know has no value. 
 (cuts him off cold) We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price, so that WE may survive, Sam. 
 You'll never sell a thing to any one of them again. 
 I understand. 
 Do you? 
 Do you!!! This is it, Sam, this is it! 
 Eric Dale. 
 Where is Eric Dale? 
 As of today he is no longer with the firm. 
 We have been trying to locate him. 
 So he is just out there with this information? 
 (Nods yes.) 
 Carmelo? 
 Yes. 
 Get me Eric Dale here by 6:30. 
 Done. 
 OK, meet back here in an hour. 
 Hell of a town isn't it? 
 Never really did it for me actually. 
 Really? 
 Always been kinda a grass and tree guy. 
 I've always loved this place. Ever since I arrived. Everything about it. 
 I can't say I feel that about anyplace actually. 
 Are you going to be able to come on board here Sam? 
 I'm not sure John. This is really ugly. 
 You and I are salesmen Sam, we sell. That's what we do. It's not complicated. 
 Exactly. And you damn well know that you don't make a sale unless you think the guy is gonna come back for more, and tomorrow we are done. 
 This is it Sam. 
 You keep saying that, what is that supposed to mean? 
 It's the big one. Most of us aren't gonna make it out of this one. 
 Us? 
 The street. 
 What are you talking about? 
 This won't be the last `situation' I will be having this week. It's just the start. 
 It's only the start because we are starting it. 
 Maybe. But I don't think that's true, not this time. The numbers just don't add up anymore. 
 Well I agree with you there, I've been saying that for years. 
 I mean if this kid can come up with this...? 
 I don't think I can go in knowing what I know and put the hammer down on these guys like this. 
 Oh please, when did you become so soft. 
 Fuck you soft, you're panicking. 
 If you're the first one out the door Sam, it's not called panicking 
 Look, I obviously don't have all the information that you do. But I think this could destroy this firm. (MORE) 
 You let me take care of that. 
 This is a fucking shit show. 
 Probably. 
 Remember this day boys, remember this day. 
 Gentlemen, there is some breakfast down the hall if you guys are hungry. 
 So what's the strategy here? 
 That's where I'm headed right now, downstairs to work on it with my guys. 
 No, you and I... with Tuld. 
 I'm not sure we need one, Sarah. That's not the way I've ever done this. 
 (with distinct sarcasm) Please. 
 He knows where we both have stood on this all along. There's nothing more to do. 
 That's exactly my point, and knowing what was discussed by both you and I with him, I don't see how that can possibly you with anything but a false sense of comfort. 
 I'm not looking for a sense of comfort here, Sarah. I don't think there is one to be found. 
 So again, what's the strategy here? 
 On this particular front, I'm just not sure there's much left to do. 
 It's very simple. Don't even think of fucking me on this one, because if we are going down... you damn well know its going to be together. 
 No, I'm not sure I do know that. 
 What do you think Tuld made last year? 
 Would you shut the fuck up. 
 Really? 
 That's a lot of fucking money. 
 Was? 
 Really? 
 ....I think I'm going to go get a coffee, does anyone need anything. 
 I need a little real air. 
 Probably a good idea. 
 Will, is that alright? 
 If I get out of here for a minute? 
 What? 
 Where's he live? 
 No... it's Eric... the last thing we need is those guys going over there, you two go try to get him. 
 May I come in? 
 Please, sit. 
 So... we are going to do this thing. 
 OK. 
 It's going to be tight. 
 Is Sam on board? 
 Not yet. 
 Is it me or Cohen? 
 It's you. 
 Of course you are well aware I filtered several warnings for you and Cohen over a year ago on this? 
 I'm not sure that's the best path for you to be taking at this point... you're going to be taken care of here... 
 (Nods) 
 Obviously it's quite complicated. 
 John I was told that in no uncertain terms... 
 It was all a very grey area. 
 It was actually made very clear at the time, by you and I and Cohen. 
 I'd really prefer that you didn't fight me on this... 
 Yes. 
 We need you to stay here till this is all done and the markets close. 
 I understand. 
 They'll go over the numbers with you downstairs... Good luck. 
 Ah fuck, it's Jared. He's coming this way. 
 Do you have a minute? 
 I know. I just need a second. 
 Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here. 
 Of course it hasn't, but during acute situations, such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations. 
 I know he will...but if he doesn't... 
 Step up. 
. 
 There he is. 
 John. 
 Cohen has done a nice job. It can work. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means, as you very well know, that you are a very important piece of this puzzle. 
 That's very generous. 
 It's not a gift. I need to know you are with me on this. 
 I'm with the firm John. 
 I won't get what I need out of your boys today unless they believe you... unless they believe in you completely. 
 I told you I have my reservations. 
 Well you can't have any reservations. 
 I'm with the firm completely John, as I always have been. Excuse me. 
 One fifty. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey... 
 Hi. It's really good to see you. 
 You too. You look tired. 
 I am. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I never left work. Just had to get out for a walk. 
 You're still working there? 
 Yes, of course... 
 Oh. I thought... 
 How are you? Are you happy? You look happy. 
 I am. 
 Well, I should get back... How's your father? 
 He's good. Thanks for asking. 
 OK. Be safe. 
 Hey... You got any inside tips for him? 
 Sell. 
 Jesus, nice place. 
 I hope it was with cash. 
 I think I should stay here. 
 I just don't think it would be appropriate. 
 Really? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Really? 
 Yeah, I bet. 
 No. 
 No. But I'm pretty sure what it says. 
 I'm sure he's right. 
 Well, I am very sorry to hear that. 
 (with pleasant disgust) Please. 
 (cuts him off cold) Not a chance. 
 You don't think I know that. I've been warning that cunt Robertson about this shit since last March. 
 Fuck her... Fuck her. 
 I signed my papers man, I'm out. They've got nothing on me anymore. 
 I've already been paid enough by them. 
 A bridge. 
 I was an engineer by trade. 
 It goes from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to Moundsville West Virginia. It spans 912 feet over the Ohio river. Steel through arch design. 12,100 people a day use the thing. (MORE) 
 One thousand, five hundred, thirty-one years... 
 That's what I did. (beat) Look... you better get back over there. 
 Crazy shit. 
 Thanks for stopping by. 
 Who the fuck is this? 
 What? 
 They fired me Will. Fuck em... Fuck em. 
 Well that's always been true. 
 See ya. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 So, am I getting fired? 
 Are you? 
 Oh. 
 I get it. 
 Fuck me. 
 How did you learn to do that? 
 Don't be, you're not doing it to me. 
 Only if we can get this done, right? 
 How? 
 There aren't really enough willing buyers out there right now. 
 Are you ok with that? 
 I guess. And what about everyone else? 
 Normal people. 
 Are we gonna be wrong on this one? 
 Hello. 
 Peter. (silence) You want one? 
 I don't smoke. 
 That's good. I don't much either. 
 It's kinda beautiful out right now. 
 Yeah, I guess it is... (almost surprised) I've never really liked this town much. 
 How long have you been here? 
 Forty years. 
 I think it's beautiful. The whole place. Forty years, that's something... Are you tired? 
 Of What?... Remember I don't work as hard as you do. 
 That's not true. 
 No it is, actually. 
 Are we all getting fired after today? 
 Probably. 
 They're going to fire you? 
 That's not what they'll call it,... it'll be a mercy killing really. 
 I don't really want to go back in there just yet. 
 I understand that. 
 I think I know your son. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. Not well... but, he always seemed like a nice person. 
 He is a nice person. 
 Have you told him what's about to happen? 
 What do you mean? 
 This whole thing. 
 No... I hadn't even thought of it. 
 I guess it's illegal anyway? 
 Yeah... who the fuck knows anymore.... and even if it was you'd sure as hell never get caught. 
 He's already pretty rich anyway though right? He doesn't need the help. 
 That's very true. 
 He works with a friend of mine. 
 He's a hell of alot richer than me, I know that much. 
 But you are taller. 
 That's true. It's not much... but it's something... What did your father do? 
 He's a doctor. 
 Really? 
 Eyes. 
 Now that's something. 
 Yeah... it is. 
 Did he want you to do that? 
 No, never. 
 Oh. 
 He was always a pretty miserable guy actually... 
 Yes they are. 
 Have you ever done anything like this before? 
 No... never.... not even close. 
 Oh... 
 Yeah. 
 Do you really think this is the only... or the... right thing to do? 
 For who? 
 I'm not sure. 
 I'm not either. 
 So this is gonna make a pretty big mess of it, then? 
 I don't even want to think about it. 
 Yeah. 
 Just doesn't quite seem... 
 I know. 
 (Very slightly shakes his head.) 
 Well. I guess we should get back. 
 Yeah. 
 Well good luck, you know, in the future... Seems like you'll probably be just fine. 
 Thank you. 
 You alright? 
 You just fired me. 
 I'm sorry... 
 This is all I've ever wanted to do. 
 Really? 
 Yes... 
 I am sorry. 
 They are almost ready for you Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes. 
 You as well? 
 Yes. 
 Jesus. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Thank you... Sam and the rest of your floor are gone after today as well. 
 Really... and Cohen? 
 No... still here. 
 Of course... 
 No. 
 He was very tall. 
 6'7''...... 
 (quietly) Wow. 
 I did pass on your concerns last year... just so you know. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 It does. 
 Have they taken all the phones out of this room? 
 Yeah... I didn't think they were going to be able to get you back here. 
 They told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything from my options to healthcare over the next two years or I come back and make... (he looks up and does a little math in his head) $176,471.00 an hour to sit in this room quietly... it wasn't much of choice. 
 It never is. 
 OK. 
 Eric. 
 I understand, there was nothing you could do. 
 I guess... at the time... it didn't seem like there was much of a choice. 
 It never does. 
 You have kids, yeah? 
 What is your package going to look like? 
 I don't know, that's what I'm waiting for now. 
 Should be pretty good, no? 
 It better be. 
 Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning, I know yesterday was pretty bad, I wish I could say that today is going to be less so but that isn't going to be the case. Now I am supposed to read this statement here to you all but how bout you read it on your own time and I'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here. 
 By the end of today almost everyone else in the world, including me, will have considerably less money than they began the day with..... You, in this room, are the exception. You will leave here today richer. You will fire the first shot, I wish it didn't have to be, but at times the market must eat its weak, and you all... are not the weak. We must strike quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is going to be in here getting in your faces, sniffing around, you let us take care of them and you just keep going. We own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it. 107 years ago this firm was founded, today we secure our place for next 107. You've got two minutes before we get started. Let's finish this, so we can get on to the next one... 
 Well done. 
 They did alright. 
 I wanted to give you a heads up. They are going to start sending some people home out here. 
 Now? 
 (He nods yes) Sorry. No loose ends. 
 Of course. 
 For what it's worth, you're good... Guess somebody upstairs must really like you. 
 Sam, please sit. Congratulations are clearly in order. 
 Our guys did what they could. 
 You did a hell of a job today, and I thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for eating but it's been a long day. Can I get you anything? 
 No, no thanks. 
 So what can I do for you? 
 I want out. 
 I'm sorry? 
 I'm done, I want out. 
 It's been a very difficult day, for everyone. 
 I need you to release my options, that is if they're still worth anything after today, and I need the bonus. I'm out. 
 You'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but I need you to stay with me for another 24 months. O.K? 
 That's true, and if I had been at least there'd be some holes in the ground to show for it. I'm just not quite sure how we fucked this thing up so badly. 
 Jesus, when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself, it's unbearable... What, you think we may have helped put some people out of business today? That it's all just for naught? Well you've been doing that everyday for almost forty years Sam. And if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there. It's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat. But it's not wrong and it's certainly not any different today than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797, 1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37, `73, and 1987... God damn did that motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97, 2000, and whatever this is gonna be called. They're just the same thing over and over. We can't help ourselves, and you and I can't control it, stop it, slow it, or even ever so slightly alter it... We just react... and we get paid well for it if we're right... and get left by the side of the road if we're wrong. There's always been and there's always gonna be the same percentage of winners and losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat pigs and starving dogs in this world... yes there may be more of us today... but the percentages... they always stay exactly the same. 
 I'll do it John, but not because of your little speech, but because I need the money. I'm not sure how it could possibly be after all these years, but I need the money. 
 Keeping him? He's getting promoted. It's all hands on deck now Sam, there's going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess, we're going to need all the brains we can get around here. 
 Hello! ... I've called the police. 
 Mary. 
 Sam? 
 Yup. 
 What are you doing? 
 Ella died. 
 Oh God. 
 Tumor on her liver. It was horrible. 
 Well I'm very sorry. 
 Yeah... I really loved that dog 
 I know, but Sam you don't live here anymore. 
 I was driving home from the vet and this is the only place I could think to bury her. This is where she belongs... 
 Well. You should have called. 
 I know. 
 Are you alright? You look terrible. 
 Yeah. Tough day all around. 
 I heard, Sammy called. 
 Is he alright? 
 He said they got hammered, but got out alive. 
 Good, I was going to call him this morning... but... 
 Well, I am going to go back in to bed. The alarm is on so don't try to break in. (Sam smiles) Well, you take care of yourself. 
 Is it alright if I finish up here?

 
 (barely comprehensible) Whathufuck? 
 What's shaking, douchebag? Thought I'd give you the heads up. You're dead. 
 VERONA (CONT'D) Yeah, that's right, you little bitch ... if you're watching this tape it means that I somehow resisted the urge to dismember you and shove the pieces down the garbage disposal ... opting instead to poison you in your sleep. Yeah, you heard me... 
 VERONA (CONT'D) ... I fucking poisoned you in your sleep. How sick is that?... for the satisfaction of watching you squirm out your last minutes knowing it was me that did it to you, and there's nothing you can do about it... 
 VERONA (CONT'D) 5A                                                                     5A ... that's right, you're on candid camera, try not to embarrass yourself... 
 VERONA (CONT'D) 
 VERONA (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... your heartbeat is slowing down like there's rust in your veins... you're like the Tin Man in the Wizard of freaking Oz... 
 (amused by his own wit, singing) "If he only had a brain." 
 (irritated) Scarecrow. Whatever. You get the point. You're fucked. You got maybe an hour, max, tough guy ... baby ... sexy ... 
 VERONA (CONT'D) Hey, it's been real. Probably should've thought twice before you whacked Don Kim. Experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight? I thought so. Have a nice death... 
 VERONA (CONT'D) ... asshole. 5A                                                                  5A (A driving SOUNDTRACK kicks in.   The OPENING TITLES play over the following:) 
 This is a eighty thousand dollar ride, cockwipe! 
 
! 
 (V.O.) Hey, this is Eve... 
 I'm glad you called, but I'm not here. Can you leave me a message? Unless you're trying to sell something, because I'm absolutely not interested. But if you're not ... 
 ... then just ... oh, wait ... time's up - 
 (O.S.) GET A CELL PHONE!!! 
 S hit! 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Come on ... 
 (O.S.) Doctor Miles' office, may I help you? 
 Let me talk to him. 
 (a generic imitation of politeness) I'm sorry, the doctor isn't in the office at this time, may I take - 
 Where is he? 
 I beg your pardon sir? 
 Where - thefuck - is - he? 
 I don't know sir, this is his answering service, would you like me to have him paged? 
 (exasperated) Fine, yes, please let the doctor know that Chev Chelios is a dead man if he can't call me back within the hour... got that?     C 
 Can you spell that for me sir? 
 D-E-A-D.   Chelios... got it? 
 Yes sir... 
 Thank you. 
 (O.S.) Hello? 
 Kaylo. My man. So, where were you last night? 
 h, what's up Chev? 
 (O.S.) I said, where were you last night? 
 (O.S.) I ... uhh ... 
 Yeah, yeah.     You wanna know what I was doing? 
 What? 
 GETTING KILLED, YOU IDIOT! 
 What? 
 What? What? You heard me.      That son of a bitch Ricky Verona. 
 Ricky Verona ... 
 (more to himself) Who would've thought that little bastard had the stones to come whack me in my own crib... it's inconceivable... and yet, here we are. 
 Where are we? 
 I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen: you put the word out I'm looking for Ricky Verona. Anyone sees him you call me. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) I'm going to get that little son of a bitch if it's the last thing I do... it may actually be the last thing I do, understand that? Copy me on that? 
 Ricky Verona? 
 Find him! 
. 
 (out of his mind) Where's Verona!! 
 (flipping out) It's cool it's cool it's cool! 
 Talk!! 
 I'm talking! What are we talking about? 
 Don't fuck with me!! 
 OK, nobody's fucking with you, just calm down ... 
 DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN MOTHERFUCKER! 
 (O.S.) O-land-o! What's up! 
 (calling back) There's a white man with a gun in here, I would prefer that he not cap my ass, so please refrain from any sudden ass bullshit! ( to CHEV) Now you see that? I'm trying to help you here. 
 Look, I got to find Ricky Verona ... 
 Why would I know where ... ? 
 ... right, I know, you don't know where he is, but you're going to tell me where he is, or I'm going to BLOW YOUR BRAINS INTO THAT TOILET!! 
 THE WHITE MAN IS COOL!   THE WHITE MAN IS 
! S ILENCE - just the sound of CHEV'S heartbeat, pumping. 
 ORLANDO (CONT'D) (calmly) Can we all just get along?   Can we? 
 ORLANDO (CONT'D) Now Chevy here has something he would like to discuss. So we are going to discuss it. In a civilized manner. Chevy? I believe you had a question, or some point you were trying to make? 
 Where's Verona. 
 OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky Verona. 
 (starting to lose it again) You pulled the Anselmo job together, don't try to bullshit me ... 
 Easy ... easy ... now things are beginning to clarify ... you see how that works? How discussion can lead to clarity? 
 ORLANDO (CONT'D) Clearly you are operating under a false pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did not "pull the Anselmo job together." In fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes me seventy five hunna dollars. 
 That's not how I heard it. 
 But that's the way it is. That's the way it is. So you see, I don't know where Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where he is, I would probably be there right now, beating his Gucci ass down. S tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying'S eyes, evaluating. 
 Alright. 
 Thank you. That's what I'm talking about. That resembles civility. 
 ORLANDO (CONT'D) Shit dude, what's the matter with you? 
 Forget it. I just gotta find Ricky Verona, that little bitch ... 
 I understand that. You've made that point abundantly clear to all of us. 
 ORLANDO (CONT'D) Now what can I do to help you? 
 Look, just give me some coke, OK?    You got any coke? 
 OK, now you're insulting me. 
 Come on, man, I know you got coke. 
 You think every brother is carrying, is that it? 
 Come on, I don't have time for this, just give me something ... I'm really dying here ... 
 I can see that. 
 No. You don't understand, I'm really fucking dying ... if I don't ... (losing it again) May I just have some coke, please? 
 So this is medicinal use coke, that's what you're telling me. 
 That's right. 
 Well? 
 W hat? 
 You got something for me, or what? 
 ORLANDO (CONT'D) Chevy ... come on, man... 
 OK, that's good.    That's good. 
 Oh that's good, right? 
 ORLANDO (CONT'D) W hy you looking for Verona anyway? 
 Seems like some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me... 
 Ah, so this is about the Don Kim situation. 
 What do you know about it? 
 I know you pulled the trigger. 
 (flipping out) Of course I pulled the trigger! WHY WOULDN'T I PULL THE TRIGGER?! 
 O...kay... 
... 
. 
 ORLANDO (CONT'D) Whoa, Chelios. You good, man? 
 his shit's not working. 
 Beg your pardon? 
 I think I know what I have to do. 
 (shrugging) Well, a man's got to do what a man's got to do. (beat) Uhh... what exactly is it that you got to do? 
 Got to kick... some black... ass. 
 What? 
 RLANDO (CONT'D) There he goes again. 
 Alright ... who wants white meat? 
. 2 INT CHEV'S CAR, MOMENTS LATER 3                                                                  23 Speeding along, weaving erratically through traffic, sweating hard, panting with adrenaline. 
 Doc? 
 ey, what's up, Doc! 
 3A                                                                 23A You motherfucker! 
 ude, aren't you dead yet?    What the hell are you doing out there? 
 23A                                                                 23A I'm coming for you, asshole, believe me. 
 eah, whatever. Look, just thought you'd like to know that I'm all about hooking up with that mystery girl you've been banging as soon as your ass is underground ... I forgot to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left for you... 
 23A                                                                 23A Yeah, yeah, then you're going to rape my grandmother, blah blah blah. What do you think Carlito is going to think when he finds out what you did? Your whole crew is history. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) (under his breath) Great. 
 arlito? That's funny, I guess you didn't know... Carlito's my boy now, we're tight. 
 You haven't been tight since your brother fucked you in 3rd grade. 
 lever. Snappy. Did you pretty good, didn't I, Chelios? Come on, you can admit it. 
 We'll see. 
 Right, right, and the best part about it is... 
 Sorry, I must take this. See you later. 
 I doubt it. C HEV pushes "answer" and picks up the new call. 
 25A                                                                    25A Yeah. 
 (V.O.) 
 Doc!    Shit, it's about time. 
 Sorry baby, I just got the message. 
 25A                                                                    25A OK, forget it, listen: I'm dying. I've been poisoned with some kind of Chinese synthetic shit. 
 Woah! 
 You've got to do something for me, it feels so crazy, like it's in my blood ... 
 Alright, slow down. You say you've been poisoned. Can you describe the symptoms? 
 It's like... it's like... like I'm slowing down... like I'm caught in a tar pit... 
 Blurred vision? 
 Yeah. 
 Dizziness? 
 S ure. 
 Pain in your chest? 
 Not really. Actually I'm feeling pretty good right now. 
 What are you doing? 
 Driving through a mall with five cops chasing me. 
 (partially to himself) The flow of adrenaline is keeping you alive. 
 I'm having a little trouble hearing you, Doc. 
 Listen, Chev - you have to keep moving. 
 Explain. 
 If I'm right, they gave you the Beijing Cocktail... very nasty ... works on your adrenal gland, blocking your receptors. The only way to slow it down is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant. 
 What's that? 
 If you stop, you die. 
 That's what I'm trying to do... just keep moving... keep the blood pumping... every time I slow down it's like my veins start to rust... 
 Have you taken anything? 
 A couple grams of coke. 
 Oh boy. Well, that's a start. Look, I'll be back in LA in an hour. I'll call you as soon as I land. Keep yourself pumped up. Don't stop, don't quit, I'll be there. C HEV gives the cops the slip and heads into a ... 
 Yo!   Right here! 
 Go. 
 (in a thick Pakistani accent) Where we go? 
 Straight.    Now. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Make a right. 
. 
 ey, crank the music. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) No, CRANK IT. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Pull over.     Come on, right here.    Thank you. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) OK, I'll be back in one minute.       Don't go anywhere. 
 OK, cowboy. 
 You move, you die ... 
 (V.O.) Hey, this is Eve ... 
 
! 
 Where you want to go, man? 
 Beverly Hills. 
 Chevy. 
 Hey boss. 
 I'm surprised to see you. 
 Well, something urgent has come up. 
 Ha!   So I've heard. 
 Then you know what happened? 
 Word travels fast.     You amaze me, my friend. 
 What can I say. Look, Carlito, I need your help. I don't have much time. 
 No, not much. 
 We've got to find an antidote or something. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) What's the matter? 
 (shrugs) The shit they gave you ... it's the Chinese shit. There is no antidote.     I wish there was something I could do. 
 What, so that's it? 
 Honestly, you should be dead already. It's a miracle. 
 A miracle. 
 We give that shit to horses ... 
 I can't believe it. 
 C          I'm sorry. 
 Well you don't have to be so damn cool about it. 
 What do you expect me to do? 
 Tell me you're going to find that punk Verona and his whole fuckin' crew and feed `em to a cage of wolverines. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) What is this? Are you boys now or something? 
 Verona? That's just a small time punk. But... that's not to say there isn't an opportunity here. 
 Opportunity. 
 Everyone knows the love I have for you, Chev. Maybe this can even the score for the Don Kim hit, which was perhaps ill- advised. 
 (flabbergasted) Ill advised? 
 The heat from Hong Kong has been more than we anticipated. 
 Oh. That's outstanding, Carlito. I'm glad to know that my death can be of some use to you. 
 Don't be difficult. 
 Am I being difficult? Is this what you call difficult? I don't know if you noticed, but I'm having a DIFFICULT FUCKING DAY, BRO! 
 re you disrespecting me, Chev?    Is that what you're doing? 
 orget it, I'm out of here. 
 You're not getting into my cab wet. 
 I just gave you 200 dollars to wait for 3 minutes. 
 You are not getting into my car no way. 
 AL QEADA!   AL QEADA! 
 CHEV (CONT'D) 
! T he whole restaurant, OLD LADIES included, dogpile the poor CABBIE, wildly protesting in a thick accent. 
 I love America! I love Bush! 
 Yeah. 
 (O.S.) 36A                                                                 36A My flight's delayed. 
 Shit. 
 (V.O.) Relax. I mean don't relax. Listen to me. The shit they gave you is cutting off your adrenaline. 
: 
 Your only shot is to massively increase the level of ephedrine in your body ... to force out the inhibitors ... 
 In English, doc.    Please. 
 (O.S.) You've got to get to an emergency room and get yourself some epinephrine ... it's artificial adrenaline ... it comes in 10 milligram syringes ... the shit's potent so don't overdo it ... probably a fifth of an injection will do. 
 Epi ... something ... 
 nephrin.    Epi-nephrin. 
 OK, OK.    (cell beeps)    I gotta go. 
 I'll call you - 
 Yeah. 
 Chev! 
 36B                                                                 36B Yeah. 
 Chev? 
 Yeah, what is it? 
 Hello? 
 KAYLO (CONT'D) Chev? 
 Uh huh. 
 Chev! I just saw Verona's brother going into Charlie O's. 
 (O.S.) Interesting. Downtown Charlie O's? 
 (O.S.) Yeah.    I was just down here getting a taco.    He went right in, like, 2 minutes ago. 
 (O.S.) Where are you now? 
 I'm across the street, getting a taco. Where are you? 
 I'm there.     Meet me on 3rd and Flower. 
 motioning to the restaurant) He's in there now? 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Did anyone go in with him? 
 CHEV (CONT'D) A lright, wait here. 
 What was that? 
 I just saw a ghost. 
. 
. 
 How you like that one, tough guy? How freaking awesome was that? 
 CHEV (CONT'D) You feel like talking to me?   Where's your brother? 
 (anger gradually overcoming the shock) Doing your mother like an Iraqi prisoner, you bitch. 
 Nice ... wonder how many steaks I could get out of you ... A LEX rolls onto his knees, and with a burst of energy throws himself at. HE SMASHES INTO THE ALLEY WALL and lands on him with his full weight. 
 CLICK. CLICK. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) WHAT?? 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Jesus ... nothing's easy ... 
 CHEV (CONT'D) You want to hold hands? 
   (O.S.) Talk to me, bro. 
 (impersonating Alex) Hey Ricky, whadya think about sucking me off, ya in the mood? Maybe let me lick your ass or sumtink? 
 Who is this? Chelios?   IS THIS FUCKING 
? 
 That's right, bro. You wanna guess how I got your brother's cell phone? 
 CHEV (CONT'D) I can tell you have it all figured out. Looks like you should've cut me up when you had the chance. 
 What's that? I can't hear you ... experiencing some 20/20 hindsight? 
 (losing it) You're supposed to be dead!!! 
 (O.S.) You know, man, I kind of like that shit you put in me. Think you can get me some more? 
 struggling to find a heinous enough threat) I'll ... I'll ... 
 I know, I know ... hey, what's this? 
. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) A necklace? You guys really are faggots aren't you? 
 You motherfucker, my grandfather gave that medallion to my father, and then to - realizing he's said too much) .. fuck you, man, shove that thing up your ass. 
 (O.S.) No thanks, but you know I believe I'll hang onto it... looks like you'll have to come find me after all. Fucked up that you killed your own brother. 
 You - 
 Out. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) What was that... epi... shit... 10 milligrams... H e shakes his head to clear it. 
 What? 
 Huh?    Oh.    I'm taking off. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) I'd get out of here if I were you. 
 Asshole. 
 (to the pharmacist) I'm looking for something ... starts with `E' ... 
 England? 
 That's funny. No, I'm talking about some kind of artificial adrenaline ... some shit ... you know ... 
 Artificial adrenaline. 
 I have heart problems. 
 Epinephrine? 
 Yes!    Yes ... that's it ... you have it? 
 I can't give you epinephrine. 
 Why? 
 Just a minute. 
 Come on, what is that... 
 Nasal spray, dude. 
 What? 
 Nasal spray. 
 TEENAGER (CONT'D) It's got epinephrine in it.   Get you tweaked, man. 
 Hey! 
 COP (CONT'D) Hey.   You. 
 I know you motherfuckers have epinephrine! 
 Hold it right there, bro! 
 You've got epinephrine on this cart!    I want that shit! 
 1 He's dropping! Stand by to defibrillate! 
 My cart... 
 What? 
 Asshole...! 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 2 hat is this? What the hell do you think you're doing? THIS IS A HOSPITAL! 
 SHUT UP!!! 
 HEV (CONT'D) You.   Get me some ... I need ... 
 (haltingly) You wanted ... epinephrine, is that right? 
 DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT! 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Give me that. 
 ... asshole... 
 Not going to tell you again. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) (to the RESIDENT) Now juice me. 
 You ... but ... I ... 
 (weakly, not much left) I haven't got all day, just do it, will you? 
 CHEV (CONT'D) GET DOWN, ASSHOLES! 
. 
 OK ... needles, hate needles ... 
 CHEV (CONT'D) How much of this stuff did he say to take? 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Woah.   Woah. Woah. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) 
! 
 Chevy! 
 (ready to explode) Yep. 
 I'm in the air, man.     Did you get the stuff I told you? 
 Got it. 
 You took it? C 
 Took it. 
 You shot the whole thing, didn't you? 
 Yep. 
 Oh boy. I said a fifth of a syringe, you idiot. Now you're dead for sure. 
 Right. 
 Chest is on fire. 
 Check. 
 But you're cold. 
 Check. 
 You got a steel hard on. 
 Let me check. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Check. 
 (getting into it) That's the stimulation of the blood vessels ... your urinary sphincter is tight as a knot ... couldn't pee to save your life ... 
 Urinary sphincter ... check ... 
 Maybe you can get a hold of some vicadin ... you still at the hospital? 
 Negative. 
 Maybe some weed ... I don't know ... 
 Check. 
 Well, that shit should be out of your system in a half hour or so, if you live that long ... this air phone is costing me a fortune ... look, I'll be in LA in twenty minutes. I'll call you when I hit the ground. 
 Copy. 
 (sincere) You're a good kid, Chev.   Nice knowing you. 
 Copy.    Out. 
 (V.O.) Police have declined to release the name of the West Hollywood man they say is still at large on a citywide rampage that has left one man dead, dozens injured and hundreds of thousands of dollars of property damage in its smoking, bloody wake.

 (V.O.) (over network graphic) We now return you to "Dr. Phil" ... 
 (tossing the gun up and catching it) You want it? You want this? 
 You son of a bitch! 
 Yeah. 
 (O.S.) (sleepy) Hey. Did you try to call? 
 (O.S.) You've been home all day? 
 I was sleeping in. 
 (O.S.) You were sleeping in, that's great, Eve ... super great ... you all rested now? 
 Yep. 
 (holding it together) Well, I'm glad to hear that. Listen, I've been fatally poisoned, there's probably a psychopath heading over there to torture and kill you as we speak, but don't bother getting out of bed, I'll be there in a flash ... Maybe you could fry me up a waffle or something, kay? E 
 (O.S.) (oblivious) Sure, come on over, I'll be here. 
 Right, you'll be there, OK. 
 Right, so... let's go get the bitch.

 (to the microwave) I hate you ... 
 EVE (CONT'D) Just a minute. 
 EVE (CONT'D) Alright, alright, Jesus ... 
 EVE (CONT'D) ... calm down, what the hell ... 
 EVE (CONT'D) Oh.   My.   God. 
 Hey doll. 
 Is this your new look or something? 
 That's right. You into it? 
 It's ... completely appalling.    Very you, Chev. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you looking for my other boyfriend? 
 (ignoring this) You haven't turned on the TV today, right? 
 No.   Why? 
 Didn't think so.    Listen, we've got to get out of here. 
 What are you talking about?    Don't be such a freak. 
 EVE (CONT'D) Actually, I'm glad you're here. Can you change the clock on the microwave? 
 What? 
 I never changed it back. 
 The microwave. 
 Yeah. I never changed it back.   You know, daylight savings time. C 
 I bought you some flowers, but they got fucked up on the way over here. 
 That's sweet. Are you OK? You look like you're on drugs or something. 
 You love me, right? 
 Yes. 
 Then I need you to do something for me. 
 What is it? What's wrong? 
 I need you to put some clothes on and come with me right now. 
 But ... I ... 
 I'll change the clock on the microwave. 
 OK. 
 (to himself) That shit's wearing off ... 
 (O.S.) (calling to him) Oh darn! I forgot, the waffle iron's on if you want to make one. 
 (calling back) Great, great ... 
 (O.S.) You're so stressed out, do you want some pot? 
 (fighting to get the words out) Yes. No! ... thanks ... 
 What's the matter? 
 (holding it in) Nothing ... burned my hand ... 
 Oh my God, are you OK?   Let me see... 
 It's nothing... don't worry about it... let's get out of here ... 
 Come on, let me see ... 
 I SAID I'M OK, CAN WE JUST LEAVE??!! 
 (coldly) That was just totally uncalled for. 
 (exasperated) I'm sorry ... look, can we just ... 
 Fine. 
 (under his breath) Shit! 
 I'm parked out back. 
 Oh darn... the thing. 
 The thing.     What thing. 
 (unlocking the door) The waffle thing. I forgot to turn it off. 
 E. - 101 
 (O.S.) Alright, alright...! 
 Hello? 
 (O.S.) (through the intercom) Hello? Hello? Alright, very funny... 
 I hate that... 
 You trying to burn down the building? 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Whoa whoa whoa... 
 Aww, damn it, I'm sorry baby... 
 (irritated) Nice one. 
 VE (CONT'D) (oblivious) I swear to God, Chev, I don't know what you're on these days but it is not working for you... 
. 
 You know, I could use a little help here. 
 Is this yours? 
 Where's your car? 
 My car. Actually... I took a cab. 
 You're embarrassing. 
 You know, I didn't have a lot of time to pick this out ... 
 Hm.   So why are we here? 
 (holding his fingers up to indicate quotation marks) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Alright, here it is. I told you I was a video game programmer. That was a lie. Actually... 
: 
 (V.O.) I kill people. I'm a professional hitman. I freelance for a major West Coast crime syndicate. 
 (V.O.) Last night was a job like a hundred others. A high dollar hit. Nothing special. 
 SAUCER-EYED. 
 HEV (V.O.) (CONT'D) And then out of nowhere this insane idea comes in through the back of my head like a .45 slug at close range... S ilence hangs heavy in the room... CHEV holds the gun to DON KIM'S head, paralyzed with indecision. 
 Well? What are you waiting for? 
 Congratulations. 
 Did I win something? 
 Your life, jackass. (beat) A hundred grand wants you dead, so sooner or later it's going to happen. But I'm not doing it. 
 I see. 
 nstead, you're going to do something for me. You're going to get out of town. Disappear. I don't care where you go, I don't care what you do, so long as you're invisible for 48 hours. That's all I ask. 
 (incredulous) 48 hours. 
 Or if you prefer, we can do it the other way, the way where I go to work and you go meet Buddah. 
 See: I quit. I quit the business. For you. 
 For me? 
 figure I call you that night. I tell you everything. You understand. (MORE) 
 You are so weird. Are we going on a trip? 
 Yeah, well... I may be going on a trip, but you're not coming with me... 
 I don't understand. 
 Eve... baby... please! 
 Mob hits, Chev? Chinese poison? Do you know how ridiculous you sound? If you're going to break up with me, at least you can tell me the truth. 
 You think it sounds crazy? How do you think I feel - I've gotta live this shit... 
 Oh my God, Chev... what's the matter with you? 
 ... just need... 
 Chev, you're scaring me. 
 (getting a desperate idea) Wait a minute. Do you trust me? 
 No. 
 Make love to me. 
 What? 
 Come on. I think it'll help. 
 Help what? 
 EVE (CONT'D) Get off!   Are you kidding me? 
 Take your clothes off. 
 No! 
 You always say you want to be more spontaneous. E 
 You're insane. You're like some adrenaline junkie with no soul. 
 Save me, Eve. Save my life. 
 Stop it! 
 EVE (CONT'D) Oh my God, Chev! 
 EVE (CONT'D) You filthy animal ... 
 EVE (CONT'D) Take me right here in front of everyone. 
 VE (CONT'D) That's it... do it ... 
 VE (CONT'D) Come on, put it in me... 
 EVE (CONT'D) What are you waiting for? 
 EVE (CONT'D) (incredulously) Tell me you're joking.    Now you can't get it up? 
 (determined) I'll fucking get it up! 
 God damn it, Chev ...! 
 Shut up! 
 CHEV (CONT'D) I'M STILL ALIVE! I'M STILL ALIVE!!! 
 HEV (CONT'D) What was that? 
 Oh God... Oh God... yes... 
 Shit! 
 What are you doing?!! 
 Yeah. 
 I've got Verona. 
 Kaylo? 
 (V.O.) I've got Verona, man. 
 What??? 
 No shit.    Where are you? 
 Don Kim's shirt factory.     Upstairs. 
 (furious, in disbelief) What's the matter with you?!! 
 (to EVE) Shh. (to KAYLO) Downtown? 
 (gulping) Yeah. 
 Listen to me. You don't let that motherfucker out of your sight. I'll be there in ten minutes. You got that? 
 (close to breaking into tears) OK, Chevy ... 
 Out. 
 I have to go. Please understand. 
 No. Chev. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. 
 hit! 
 (screaming after him) YOU'LL BURN IN HELL FOR THIS!!! 
 (shouting back, voice trailing off) I'll call you! 
 (heavy accent) Hey. 
 Right... just step on it, alright? 
 Hey, you not gonna die in my cab, crackhead. 
: 
 (laughing) Nice. 
 (irritated) What are you laughing at? Look at this! 
 What the hell. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) ( grimacing) Tastes like ass. 
 That's right, devil. You wait. 
 We're here. 
 What'd you say was in this stuff? 
 I told you: it's hardcore. 
 (still shaking it off) Wow. 
 Five fifty five. 
 It's all you, man.    Keep it. 
 Have a nice day, devil. 
 Right... 
 (to himself) Wait a minute, wait a minute ... 
 CHEV (CONT'D) (suddenly suspicious) This is fucked. 
 #1 (O.S.) Where's he going? 
 #2 How the hell should I know? He went in where they load the boxes. Alright, alright ... H e clicks off - and CHEV is on him, snatching up the'S gun, spinning him around and poking it into the soft flesh under his chin. 
 (sarcastically) Hey, what a coincidence, you like this spot too? 
 #2 Chevy!   Shit! 
 What the fuck is this, you working for the Chinese now? 
 #2 The Chinese... are you crazy? 
 Yeah I am.     Where's Kaylo? 
 #2 Chevy ... I'm sorry, man ... I didn't ... 
 (losing his patience) OK, ding, time's up ... 
 #2 (O.S.) (falling) You son of a ... ! 
 Alright, where is that motherfucker? 
 #3 Uh ... hey, Chev. 
 What the fuck is this? 
 #1 Chevy, baby, take it easy. 
 ike this? WHERE'S VERONA? 
 #1 Verona got nothing to do with this. 
 What? 
 #1 Don Carlos wants you off the street. 
 (stunned) Carlito? 
 #1 You've totally lost your shit, dude ... you're all over the TV ... destroying property, making unauthorized hits ... you're causing the organization a great deal of embarrassment. 
 Carlito ordered this? 
 #1 (ignoring it) Look, forget about Verona. We'll take care of him. The best thing for you to do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place and just ... die. 
 Just die. 
 #1 Yeah.   Just ... die. 
 ... 
 Maybe you're right. 
 #1 (rationalizing) I mean we all gotta die sometime, right? 
 That's true ... we all gotta die ... 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Right ... so ... let's all die ... 
 #1 Eh? 
 HOOD #1 (CONT'D) What the...? 
. 
 
! 
 You!    Assholes! What you want! 
 DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!! MY BOYFRIEND 
!!! 
 Nice. 
 I had to see if you were telling the truth... oh, and you have my purse. 
 Come on! Wait - 
 CHEV (CONT'D) ... OK, now come on. 
 Darn it, I forgot to take my birth control pill. 
 here's the keys? E VE holds out her hand, where she's had them all along. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) (taking them) Cool. 
 My stuff... 
 You weren't lying. 
 Welcome to my life. 
 (head over heels IN LOVE) No, I mean: that you were going to give it all up for me. 
 Oh. Yeah. 
 And the other part? 
 The poison? Yeah, that's true too. 
 (cracking) Then... that means... 
 Pretty much. 
 How can we stop it? 
 Adrenaline. It's the only thing that slows it down. 
 (getting it) So... when we were in Chinatown...? 
 Yeah. Sorry. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
 his will get you going. 
 WHAT? 
 Come on, let's finish what you started. 
 Oh boy... 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Oh yeah, that's... that's really working for me... 
 (working him up) You like that? 
 Stay down. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) That's it that's it that's it... just a little... 
 CHEV (CONT'D) (flustered) What's the matter? 
 (satisfied) So you can fall asleep like you always do? I don't think so. 
 Are they... OK? 
 They're dead. 
 How can you... how can you do that...? 
 I told you, baby... I quit. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Wait here. 
 Jesus Christ! Now what...? 
 What's the matter? 
 (pointing at her) Stay. 
 He's got a gun! 
 I can't feel my leg. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) H ello? 
 Chevy! Holy shit, man, I've been trying to reach you for a half hour. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm at my office. Can you get here? 
 Sure, why not? 
 I owe you again, Doc. 
 You're my best customer. 
 gesturing with his head at the 
) What is this stuff? 
 Synthetic ephedrine, diluted with saline. 
 It feels sort of good. 
 Oh, I also gave you a little meth. That's the endorphins rushing into to your brain that you're feeling. 
 So I'm not... better? 
 Fuck no. You're in such shit shape it's stunning. I've never seen a heart take this kind of punishment and keep ticking. You should be in a fucking medical journal or something. 
 So... what are you going to do? 
 The solution I'm giving you is acting as a competitive inhibitor... meaning it pushes the poison out of your receptors and replaces it with a chemical... it's a temporary fix... 
 Then what? 
 Look, if we put you on life support we could maybe string you out for a few days, but at some point you'd almost certainly lapse into a coma... and then... 
 (cocking his head toward the next room) Does she know? 
 (no inflection) I hate television. 
 f you want, I can load you up with something, you'll go out in a beautiful dream. 
 A dream. 
 (gently) Can I do that for you, Chev? 
 No... no, that's not what I want. 
 Then ... what? 
 One hour. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) I want one hour. 
 
 Give me a fucking break... 
 (V.O.) 27                                                                   127 And so the wild rampage that began at 9 AM this morning in West Los Angeles continues, with the mysterious suspect still at large. 
 Maybe we shoulda give him more of that Chinese shit. 
 (sarcastic) Oh ... you think?    Jesus ... 
 VERONA (CONT'D) (shaking his head in disbelief) It's him. Alright, shut up. 
 VERONA (CONT'D) What's up, corpse. 
 Hey douchebag, thought you might be interested in a little deal. 
 A deal?   You're mental, dude. 
 I want the antidote. 
 Oh, the antidote, huh? 
 That's right. 
 And what are you prepared to give me. Asshole. 
 How about the jewelry I got off your faggot brother, you cocksucker? 
 (holding back, tight lipped) Hmmm. 
 Thinking about it? 
 Alright. 
 You like that deal? 
 Whatever. 
 I'll be at Downtown Standard in twenty minutes. You know the spot? 
 Of course. 
 Don't be late, or I'll trade this thing to some whore for a hand job ... 
 (cutting him off) I'll be there. 
 VERONA (CONT'D) (to the BOYZ) What the hell are you looking at? 
 ERONA (CONT'D) Verona. You're not going to believe the call I just got. 
 (O.C.) It's going to be alright, baby. 
 (O.C.) But... you said... 
 (O.C.) I know. But things have changed. There's an antidote. I can make a deal for it, but I've got to go alone. 
 (O.C.) I'm scared. 
 (O.C.) Of course. But you'll be safe now. And I'll be back. 
 Do you promise? 
 I promise. 
 What's happening, brother? 
 Where did I go wrong? 
 (weirded out) Did you say something? 
 Like talking to the wall... C 
 Mom? 
 I'm amazed you remember you have a mother. 
 (falling right into it) Right, with you popping Valium like Tic Tacs and balling some new asshole every two weeks... why wouldn't I stick around for entertainment like that? 
 That's hurtful. 
 (exasperated) Mom, I got no time for this... 
 You got no time, period. 
 Orlando? 
 ou a persistent motherfucker, Chev Chelios, I'll give you that. 
 (reacting) This is weird. 
 But you know this has got to stop sometime. What do you think you are, Michael Myers? They pop you and you just keep gettin up? 
 I'm the Terminator. 
 You was that, maybe. But there's a new gun in town. 
 Don't tell me you're talking about your bro, Def Lepard. 
 He did you pretty good, didn't he? 
 Yeah, not so much. I don't get it - why didn't you guys just cut me up alive when you had the chance? 
 Verona said you was Chev Chelios - A.K.A. Death On Two Legs. (MORE) 
 Bipolar. Sadomasochistic tendencies. Adrenaline junkie. Addicted to violence... probably spends every day of his life looking for the big thrill, the big rush. Cutting up a guy like that while he screams in his own blood and excrement would be like... like a GIFT... a warrior's death... hell, you'd probably get off on it... 
 Did you rehearse this? 
 No, this was the best way for a guy like you: a slow, ticking clock... winding down... inevitable... non-negotiable... until... 
 (cutting him off) Who the hell are you, anyway? 
 Don't you know? 
 (soberly) I think I'm starting to figure it out. 
 Yeah, well, better late than never. (conversational) You know you're going to die up there. 
 (cold) Yeah, maybe. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) But I'm taking you with me. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) (under his breath) Some pills, Doc. 
. 
 CHEV (CONT'D) Easy ... 
 This way. 
 (smug) What's up, dead? 
 Looks like everyone's here. 
 (chuckling despite himself) Chelios... what a fucking mess you are. 
 No shit. 
 Why don't you sit down? 
 Wait a minute. gesturing to the GOONS by the door) Pat him down again. He's carrying something. 
 Let me see that. 
 CARLITO (CONT'D) Clever ... what is this, an insulin pump? 
 Basically. 
 What the fuck is insulin? 
 (holding the device up) Ephedrine, right? 
 CARLITO (CONT'D) (bemused) Very resourceful ... 
 to Verona) Found a new master, you little bitch, is that it? 
 I'm nobody's little bitch. 
 (egging him on) We'll see what kind of a bitch you are when Carlito hires you for half what he used to pay me... and you take it. 
 That's enough. 
 You'll probably throw boss a nice little reach-around just to show what a good bitch you are. 
 I'm nobody's little bitch, you hear me? He'll pay what I tell him to pay...! 
 I said that's enough. (calmly) It's been a long day. But in the end, you must agree, it all works out quite nicely. Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you... 
 ARLITO (CONT'D) ... and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall. Please understand, Chev, it's truly nothing personal. 
 Speak for yourself. 
 Is that what I think it is? 
 The Chinese shit. (nods to the GOONS) Hold him down. 
 Not so fast, motherfucker. 
 Dude's gone dipsy doodle... 
 VERONA (CONT'D) Whatever, psycho... 
 I'm afraid the Houdini act is over, Chelios. 
 (imitating a gunshot) Booosh! 
 (freaking) Ourfather whoartinheaven hallowedbethy - 
 Shut up, Verona. 
 So this is how it is. 
 What... you... he... 
 Presto. 
 Get me out of here! NOW! 
 Yes sir. 
 (from behind the bar) I'll kill you for this, Chelios! 
 Too late! 
 Get down! 
 Thanks, boss. 
! 
 Ronnie James Dio...! 
 Oh no you don't... 
 Police have moved to surround the Downtown Standard Hotel, where the suspect ... the unidentified madman ... is believed to be holed up and making a desperate last stand ...! 
 Present from Kaylo. 
 (in a bloodthirsty rage) Now what? Now say shit! 
 (shaken for once) Jesus, man, where the fuck where you? 
. 
 WHO'S THE BITCH NOW? 
 VERONA (CONT'D) That's right, motherfucker!   FLY! 
 Do not use a hatchet to remove a fly from your friend's forehead. 
 You're dead, you're dead, you're dead! C HEV swoons; his eyes roll back in his head ... he starts to go limp, fall backwards ... 
 I told you I'd kill you, you son of a bitch! 
 HEV (CONT'D) There. 
 (O.S.) ... leave a message. 
. 
 (O.S.)

 Insurance? 
. 
 F.G. (kicks the slot machine) Don't you hold back, baby. Spit it out, darlin'. C'mon... Hey! Hey, this ain't right. S'posed to be eight hundred dollars. Where's the goddamn manager? Who's in charge of these rip-off slots? Yo, ma'am... change lady... 
 FIGURE/BERNIE Hey Doris, you got any cream? 
 Forget it. 
 (sotto) Shit. (to Doris) Dewars and a Diet Coke. Please. 
 Hi, Natalie. 
 Hi. Uh... 
 Bernie. 
 Yeah, Bernie. (to Doris) Hey, you seen Shelly around? He promised to position me at the tables tonight. I've been on skid row all week. 
 (chilly) You didn't settle me from last night. 
 No? You sure? Fuck... And I was way under. It's been, like, an A.A. convention the whole week. I'll make up for it tonight. Promise. 
 If I see Shelly, I'll let him know. That you're looking for him. 
 Thanks. 
 Bitch. That's the third time this month... (to Bernie) Let me get you that cream. 
 (staring after Natalie) Nah, it's okay. 
 Don't get sweet on that, Bernie. Not unless you're looking to get short- changed. 
 Hey, Bernie, Shelly needs you on eleven. 
 (nods) Uh... Let's do the Chivas Regal. Have that... Natalie bring it over. The one working nickel slots next to the Paradise. I spoke to Shelly earlier, he wants her at the tables. 
 This is you, right? 
 (takes it from her) Thanks. 
 Joe said I should stick around. You say something to Shelly? 
 Wow. That was fast. Hey, thanks. 
 Don't mention it. 
 I'll make you a fortune on five and nine. C'mon forty-five-sixty-three fifty-four! 
 Hey, buddy, is this your drink? 
 Back off, pal. I'm on a roll here. 
 Seven out! 
 Mother-fucker! 
 Thank you for those bets, folks. 
 (V.O.) Conway, party of twelve, please check your reservation at the Paradise Lounge. 
 (to himself) Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'... 
 How do you do, Shelly? 
 First off, Shelly, I want you to know, I have nothing but respect for you. You've done a fantastic job with the Shangri-la for the last sixteen years. No one would dispute that. 
 But, the business has changed out here. You just have to take a look at the Strip to see what I'm talking about. 
 Yes, well... there's no denying the bottom line. Those eyesores are raking it in. And we can't compete against that. 
 The numbers, they don't back you up, Shelly. Nostalgia's grand. We all love nostalgia -- but it belongs in a museum. I think it's time to decide whether you're running a museum or a casino. 
 (rubs his hands together) So, how's the action? 
 I was just heading over to -- 
 (stealing glances at Natalie) I told you, I'm not gonna be around after Sunday. 
 (sighs) Seven days, Shelly. Seven days and I'm out from under. 
 Things are getting hot on fourteen. I gotta go. 
 (O.S.) ...Oh yeah, baby, give it to me. Oh yeah, that's the spot... Do it to me harder, you big stud... Oooooh... 
 Seven and Seven? 
 Thanks, dollface. 
 Oh shit... Sorry... I'm such a klutz. 
 It's all right. Happens. 
 Sorry, this guy... fuckin' hands, you know... 
 S'okay. You might want to stick around. 
 Excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton. You have no hard eight. 
 (throwing in a chip) Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight. 
 Eight the hard way! 
 Nine hundred dollars to Mr. Pinkerton. 
 Parlay! Parlay! 
 C'mon. You can take that action. 
 That's what I'm talking about. None of this low limit bullshit. 
 Dollar hard eight. 
 Eight easy! Easy eight! Hard eight comes down. 
 Five hundred dollar hard eight. And press my nine up two units. 
 Easy way eight! Eight easy! 
 Hard eight. 
 (O.S.) Way to go, Pinkie! Bet the farm. 
 Seven out! 
 What the fuck you smiling at, bitch? 
 Shelly. I was a goddamn embarrassment tonight. I shouldn'a let you talk me into going on. (massages his throat) It's definitely strep. 
 (dangling the panties on his finger) You get a receipt? 
 Charmayne's in the lobby. They got these on sale in the window. Victoria Secret's Valentine's Collection. And the broad waiting in the room, what she set you back? Always Grade-A for Ol' Buddy. 
 (affectionately) Get back here, you prick. Hand it over. 
 Whassimatter, kid? You got that Nostradamus look. 
 You ever watch those nature shows on 
? 
 I've seen this one a dozen times. It's about lions. Cycle of life thing. The leader of the pack... 
 Yeah, pride. The leader of the pride... when he gets on in years. It's just a matter of time before some young male arrives on the scene to challenge him. They go at it and the old cat gets the crap beaten outta him. It's humiliating. In front of all the females, this goes down. And after he's defeated, he's cast out of the pride, to scavenge and die alone in the bush. 
 No shit. It's fucking tragic because the old lion can't figure it out on his own. That he's past it. It'd be so much easier for him to just walk away and save himself all that pain and humiliation. 
 (a beat) Yeah. Me, too. 
 Shelly, got a minute... 
 Shelly, this is Johnny Capella. 
 How ya doin', Shelly? 
 Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz at the Mirage. Sony's talking about signing him to a three album deal. They're positioning him as the new Ricki Martin. 
 Johnny's looking to headline. I told him we might be interested. 
 Hey, if this is a bad time... 
 Sounds like the two of you need to get on the same page. (to Larry) If I don't hear from you by Thursday, I'm taking the Stardust's offer. 
 Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be able to hook us up with some showgirls. Something with class. 
 You got any Asian babes? 
 I think I'll just stick with the tables. 
 Buy you a drink? 
 (almost to herself) Your Progressed Venus is Gemini, 12.5 Degrees, and is in Direct motion. Which tells me that you're a slow starter when it comes to romance. (off Bernie's taken aback expression) You know what? This is real unprofessional of me. I shouldn't discuss your chart with you until I'm all done. I can tell by that look, you think this is all a lot of B.S. 
 No... I just know what the outcome's going to be. 
 The outcome? There's not, like, one particular outcome. A lot of things enter into it. The planets, moon phases... 
 The outcome won't change with me. It'll be all bad. 
 God, I have never met anyone who was so down on themselves. I used to be down on myself, OK? I don't go there anymore. I've got just three more correspondence classes with this stuff, then I'll have my certificate and everything. And you know how I got OK? 
 (deadpan) You had your chart done. 
 Yes, as a matter of fact that is perfectly correct. 
 Do you know what I do at the Shangri- la? 
 I asked around. You're a "cooler." You turn winners into losers. 
 And do you know how I do that? 
 I know there's stuff that goes on in casinos all the time -- 
 I do it by being myself. People get next to me and their luck turns. It's always been that way. 
 That sounds to me like a self fulfilling prophecy. There's a whole chapter on that in my course. Anyways, I can see a big factor in your life is that you're lacking companionship. There's nobody to deflect off. If you've got, as you put it, bad karma, then you need someone with good karma to neutralize it. Well, that's my take on it anyway. 
 I don't know about you, but I'm real tired. 
 I have this recurring dream where I'm on some beautiful island in the Bahamas. I'm sitting on the beach, taking in this amazing sunset with one of these in my hand (gestures to her drink) ...and then it starts to rain. And I wake up and it's my roof leaking on me. Yeah, I'm also real tired, Bernie. 
 (not even sure why he's telling her this) I only got six more days. Well, almost five really. Then I'll be leaving town. 
 Only five more days? (a beat) Then we shouldn't waste any more time. 
 Why don't we go back to your place? 
 (completely caught off-guard) I, uh... If this is... I don't know... I don't know if I can afford... 
 Oh god... I'm so sorry... I didn't mean... You see -- that's exactly what I'm talking about. I've gone and "cooled" the damn table. 
 Ah, just shut up, Bernie. You haven't gone and cooled anything. Not by a long shot. 
 You should complain about this. 
 I'm not here that much. Drink? Sorry, all I got's gin. 
 Nah. I've had my fill. Go ahead. 
 You know, once they're dead, they don't really grow back. In case, that's what you're waiting for. 
 So... got any music? 
 Sit. Relax. I promise you, at least one of us has done this before. 
 This is not my first -- 
 Sssh. Surprise me. 
 You're doing real good. 
 Sorry... 
 Don't worry, Bernie. I've had worse. We'll try again later. 
 Hey, so, you wanna get some breakfast? 
 (V.O.) -- I did six months at Rikers for running numbers. It was Shelly's thing, but I took the rap for it. 
 After I get out, I call up Shelly and he tells me to come out here. I figure he's going to set me up good at the Shangri-la. But he tells me they got all these rules about casinos employing felons. So he gets me this gig doing telemarketing for one of their fronts -- trying to scam pensioners out of their retirement money. I lasted two weeks. 
 Already, I was getting in deep. Finally it got so bad, I had to beg Shelly to take on my markers around town. That just bought me more time to keep losing. I put Shelly in an awkward position. I understand why he did what he did. (taps his knee) 
 He did that to you? What, he shot you? 
 Baseball bat. (off her cringing expression) I got off easy. 
 That's getting off easy? 
 I was out of control. 
 But he maimed you... 
 Let me tell you something. I'm grateful for what he did. (off her stunned look) No kidding. Every time I get an urge to play off the clock -- to so much as drop a quarter in a slot -- I reach down and squeeze what's left of my cartilage. It's one helluva reminder. 
 Jesus... I thought stuff like that didn't happen no more. Like that was just in the movies or something. 
 Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a payment plan. Two years off the books at the Shangri-la, cooling tables. Five more days and I walk. 
 (clutching her belly) Oh shit, I think I'm going into labor! 
 (shocked) Mikey? 
 Bernie... 
 I'm OK now. False alarm. Thanks. 
 Mikey? Is that...? You're not the... 
 (nods) Bull's eye. One time. Obviously runs in the family. I guess you're gonna be a grandfather, Bernie. 
 This you? 
 Hey, what the fuck, it runs. Anyways, we gotta be somewhere... 
 How's your mom doing? 
 I'm gonna pretend like you give a shit and tell you, she's getting by. As long as she's wasted. 
 Name's Charlene, in case you were wondering. Looks like she's carrying a whole litter in there, don't it? 
 When was the last time you saw a doctor? 
 This clinic in Jersey. Maybe six months ago. I wasn't about to go back after they treated me like cattle. Just because I didn't have no insurance. And those places, they're crawling with T.B. from all 'em spies. 
 So, you're in town...? 
 Maybe a week or so. Got some business to take care of. 
 If you want, stop by the Lucky Star Motel. Give us a chance to catch up. I'm on three to eleven shift at the Shangri-la. I work the floor. 
 No shit. Well, how 'bout that? Yeah, maybe I'll do that. We can play catch up. For the kid's sake. Gotta split. 
 (to Charlene) Take care. 
 Thanks... 
 Don't mention it. 
 (he knows the routine) Hundred dollar minimum here, sir. 
 Money plays one hundred. 
 (to Bernie) No offense, pal, but there's twenty other tables. What do you wanna come sit on my head for? 
 Just wanna play one hand. Feeling lucky tonight. I got this voice in my head, says this is the table... 
 I know this is the table. I'm already doing good here. It's my fucking table -- 
 (touching him) Hey, heard the one about the fella walks into a bar and says, "Hey, who owns that big great dane outside?" A man at the end of the bar raises his hand. "I do." The fella says, "Yeah? Well, my dog just killed it." 
 "Whaddya mean your dog just killed my great dane? What kinda dog you have?" The fella just shrugs and says, "A chihuahua." "You tellin' me your chihuahua just killed my great dane? How?" (a beat) "I dunno," the fella says, "I think he got stuck in his throat." 
 Insurance? 
 God damnit! 
 You said, one hand. 
 (agitated; to dealer) Keep going. 
 Hey, stick around, pal. You and me, we make a great team. 
 Is there a problem? 
 (re: Bernie) Let me guess? This is one of your "coolers?" 
 (lowers his voice) Man, they told me you were a stickler for the old ways. But coolers? What is this guy, some kind of degenerate gambler? Reformed card shark? He doesn't look too effective to me. 
 Sure. Whatever. But there ways -- subtle ways -- to keep things in our favor. I'm talking more forward thinking methods. 
 As a matter of fact I do. Like, right off the bat, I can tell you this wallpaper isn't going to cut it. It's too uplifting. I would go with more muted tones. 
 And personally, I think the waitresses can all pop another button or two. Myself, I wouldn't hire anything less than a C cup. 
 Know what this is? Music to be sure. Pleasant, non-intrusive. But blended in at a subsonic level is a mantra. "Lose... lose... lose." And that's just skimming the surface. We really need to talk, Shelly. 
 Shelly, you better come quick. 
 What about the Paradise? 
 That won't be necessary. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 What? 
 Nothing. You're just an easy mark, is all. 
 An easy mark? 
 Yeah. Easy mark. You never heard that term? 
 When we were kids, Shelly and me, we used to work Coney Island during the summer. When a guy would walk up and seemed eager to open his wallet, we would always mark him with chalk. We'd pat him on the back or arm with the chalk. Like, 'Hey buddy, good job!' (pats Natalie) Meanwhile, he had no clue the other guys saw him coming a mile away. Easy mark. 
 You OK? 
 You notice last night, that tattoo on my butt? 
 (are you kidding?!) Little Joe. 
 Yeah, two twos. Little Joe. 
 I had a son. His name was Joe. I was his mother for a year. 
 You know, you don't have to tell me this. 
 I want to, Bernie. Better you know the worst of me up front. Later, when I'm already invested in you, it'll be too hard to come clean. After I tell you this, you'll probably... I mean, I'll understand. 
 I gave my son up for adoption. I just wanted my life back. I was seventeen going on eighteen and I was selfish. My family, they didn't want to have nothing to do with me after that. So I hitched a ride out here. Figured I could make it as a showgirl. Ten years later... (shrugs; starts to break up) I like to think that if it happened when I was older -- with some guy I cared about -- maybe things would have been different. I think about my Little Joe. And, I do know he's better off. I'm convinced of that. 
 So, you wanna go try your hand at the dime pitch? It's early still. 
 I gotta go pee. I'm always peeing. 
 (to Mikey) How did you get in here? 
 I told the desk clerk Bernie was my old man. He let us wait inside. That a problem? 
 Bernie's looking for a parking space. 
 (chuckles) Shit. I musta taken the last one. 
 Tell me something, Natalie? Is he paying you? 
 Excuse me? 
 My old man, is he renting your ass? 'Cause otherwise I just don't get it. A loser like my pops in the company of some primo T & A. It don't compute. 
 This enough to get me a taste? Family discount? 
 Mikey... 
 Hey, Bernie. I told you I was gonna stop by. 
 Yeah... I figured you'd call ahead. We were out at breakfast. 
 You missed some. 
 You see, the thing is, Bernie, we're kinda strapped. I mean, Charly here's expecting like yesterday, and we don't have the dough to make with the right nutrition for her an' all. So, I was wondering if you would care to invest a little in your grandchild's future... his well being. 
 There's about three grand there. That's all I got. 
 Bless you, Bernie. (pats her belly) You know, Michael, I  -- think we should name her Bernadette. After your father. 
 You mean, Bernie. Trust me, it's a boy. 
 (to Bernie) Wanna feel her? 
 I don't think... I don't want anything to hap... 
 Ooh, I just felt her kick. C'mon, Bernie, gimme your hand... 
 Feel that? 
 (not sure) I don't know... I think so... 
 We'll catch you later, Bernie. I think I'm gonna take Charly over to the hospital right now. Get her checked up real good. 
 Take care, Pop. 
 Mikey... 
 You're not going to try anything stupid while you're in town? 
 You mess up and they'll cut you no slack. That's all I'm saying. You got a kid to think about. 
 Don't worry, Shelly, you're gonna love it. 
 (gesturing to the model) She's perfect. Three floors of gaming, IMAX theater, entertainment center, boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster, you name it. She'll pay for herself in three years, and then it's easy money. 
 Yeah, we've all seen the movie. And your point is? 
 What are you talking about? It's right outta the movie? 
 (laughs) Behind the bar, that's a good one. 
 Speaking of things to digest, I'm starving. How's that buffet they got in the Valley of the Blue Moon? You recommend their prime rib, Shell? 
 I thought we were gonna eat? 
 Out! Seven, line away seven... 
 C"mon, pops! What the hell? I coulda paid my mortgage with the money I just lost. 
 Hey? I'm supposed to be next... 
 We're coming out. Crap Eleven, any seven. 
 Hurry it up, gramps. Your soup's getting cold. 
 Crap, Ace Deuce. Line down. 
 Hey, Busketti, maybe you should try shuffleboard. 
 Uncle Palsy? Shake'em this direction. 
 Four, hard four. The point is four. 
 Good now throw it before you fucking keel over and die, old man. 
 Happy birthday to me. Happy Birthday to me... Jesus, fuck, I'm another year older already. 
 OUT! Seven! Line away. 
 Don't take it so hard, pops. Everybody craps out. 
 Now go change your fucking Depends. 
 This town... You know, Natalie, all I want to do is go some place where I can tell day from night. Where they got clocks on the wall. I can't breathe around here no more. Four days and I'm gone. I'm not even sure I can hold out that long. 
 (a beat) So where does that leave us? 
 A week ago, I didn't remember what it was like to have a woman's hands on me. I'm still pinching myself, expecting to wake-up from... (just blurts it out) Come with me, Natalie. I want you to come with me. 
 God, Bernie, that's... 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring that on you. 
 Bernie... I want to be with you. I do. But I don't know if I can leave with you. 
 I was working on a compatibility chart for the two of us. And it looks good, really, it does. 
 So, what's the problem? 
 That's with us here. In Vegas. 
 Maybe I was being presumptuous, 'cause I knew you were leaving... and I tried working it in different ways... It wasn't good, Bernie. I got scared. But that's just for now, for the immediate future. Once the planets realign, maybe a year from now... 
 Natalie... I can't... Not another year. Not another week. 
 I think... we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. 
 Why, Bernie? We only got a couple days left together. Why not make the most of them? 
 (a long beat) Because if I spend one more night in your arms, I'm not going anywhere. 
 And that's so bad? 
 Take care, Bernie. 
 Natalie, don't... 
 (O.S.) Get you another? 
 (nods) I think you better bring me the bottle. Please. 
 (V.O.) Chang, party of fifteen, your table is ready, Chang party of fifteen. 
 (clutching her tummy) Come on, Mikey. This is our future. Don't blow it. 
 Put this on the line for the boys. 
 With shoes! 
 Dealer's got shoes. Hands high, the dice are out! The point is nine. 
 Come on all you's. Put a good thought in for our baby! 
 Six the hard way! 
 Oh my god, I just felt him kick! He knows. He knows you're all pulling for him. God bless you all. 
 Six the hard way! Look out, we got a shooter! 
 Eighteen thousand since I stepped up. I'm sorry, Shelly, I guess I've been hit and miss lately. 
 Seven out! Line away. 
 (bowing) I thank you. My wife thanks you. My unborn child thanks you. 
 Color me up will ya? 
 You've gotta be kidding me. (off Shelly's steely glare) That's not how I propose we handle it. We'll turn the matter over to the authorities. They'll be blacklisted, their credit ruined... 
 Uh, thanks. Just lucky I guess. 
 Oh my God... I can feel the contractions coming on... 
 Shelly, stop them! Don't do this! 
 It's got everything to do with me. He's my son. 
 I said, he's my -- 
 Pop, help me... 
 Shelly, don't you fucking do it! 
 NO! God, no! I didn't know nothing about it. 
 Shelly, they didn't get away with the money... You didn't lose anything... 
 Oh Jesus... Yes! All right. It's on me. 150 G's. 
 Oh god, oh god... you gotta get me to the hospital... contractions... 
 Shelly, please help her. That's my grandson... 
 (nods) Hurts so bad... 
 Oh God... 
 Jesus NOOOOO!!! 
 I'll make it up to you, Pop, I swear... 
 It's on me. 
 What are you doing?! I thought we had -- 
 Oh god... it wasn't my idea. 
 (nods, sobbing) I want... to be a mother... please don't hurt me... 
 I did this to myself. I planted the seed. When Angela took off with Mikey, I didn't... I never made an effort to get back in his life. I figured, the kid don't need a loser for a father. Now it's all come full circle. I give him the money, I open the door to all this... I musta had it coming. Payback. 
 Bernie, it's a big world out there. If you just took off -- if we took off. 
 You awake, Bernie? 
 I -- think I love you. 
 No, I don't think. I'm pretty certain of it. 
 You blind-sided me, Bernie Lootz. I never saw this coming. You shouldn't do that to a girl. 
 There's still things you don't know... should know... I don't want to ruin it... 
 It won't make any difference, Natalie. Whatever you come clean about, I'm not gonna feel any different about you. I'd say the words, but with my luck... 
 Say 'em anyway. To hell with rotten luck. That's overs. 
 (a beat) I love you, Natalie. 
 Trixie? 
 Trix. You came back. 
! 
 (looking around) Got any cre -- 
 (V.O.) Lovett, party of six, your table is ready, Lovett, party of six. 
 Duty calls. 
 Hey, Shelly, check it out. The new Mega-Million. I call her Marnie, 'cause she's one frigid broad. Sure, once in a while she'll flash you a bit of tit, but your chances of hitting a home run -- one in twenty million. Here, give her a shot... 
 I don't know... 
 (shrugs) Guess I'm having an off day. 
 Nothing's wrong. Fact is, I've never felt better. 
 She loves me, Shelly. She told me last night. Natalie. 
 Sweet Jesus... you popped her cherries. 
 Sorry. 
 I don't understand... 
 I can't do that. 
 It wasn't an act. I meant it. I love him. 
 I thought you were his friend... 
 Hi. Any of you seen Natalie around? I'm supposed to give her a ride home. 
 #1 I think she left already. She wasn't feelin' too good. We been covering for her. 
 (calls to the bathroom) Natalie? You in there? 
 (sotto) Natalie. 
 
 I want you to tell me the truth, Shelly. Did you say something to Natalie? Did you muscle her -- 
 This guy's all flash. No soul. I miss Buddy. Place isn't the same without him. 
 (confused) You gave him an easy out? What are you talkin' about? I thought he... 
 Jesus... you... How can you sit here and justify it? Like you were Dr. Kevorkian or something? 
 Bernie? You awake? 
 Yeah. 
 Let's just take off. 
 I mean it. Let's just pack up and go. Tonight. 
 (closes his eyes) I can't do that. I've got an obligation to Shelly. There's no -- 
 Fuck Shelly. He doesn't give a shit about you. Let's just climb into your car and get the hell out of here. 
 I can't do that, Natalie. They'd come after me. And because you were with me... I wouldn't want that on me. 
 Just hold me. 
 Hey! Ouch! What are you...? 
 You got no fucking right...! 
 I tried... I couldn't... 
 (hysterical) I can't leave! I won't! I love him. Doesn't that mean anything to you, you heartless fuck? 
 (yells) Bernie would! I got friends! You don't fuckin' own me. You got no right -- 
 Fuck you! 
 Natalie. 
 (O.S.) No, don't. I've got a headache. 
 (closing the door) Did you take something? I got some aspirin in the -- 
 Yeah. I already took something. 
 Ouch! 
 Natalie, what happened? The mirror... 
 Natalie. 
 Bernie, no! Shit... 
 Oh Jesus... Natalie, who did this to you? We need to call the police... 
 I love you, Bernie. I just want you to know that. I fell in love with you. That wasn't part of the plan. I thought... easy money... 
 What are you saying? 
 Shelly. He paid me to get next to you. To keep you around. Whatever it took... 
 (a whisper) Shelly? 
 You got it right the first night. I was for sale. Bought and paid for. You were the easy mark, Bernie. 
 At first you were just another John. But then I started to take a closer look. For the first time, here was someone who wasn't trying to hustle me. Wasn't pretending to be somebody he wasn't. Just a decent guy trying to get back on track. And it didn't hurt any that you put me up on a pedestal. It sure puts the gutter into perspective... 
 (still in disbelief) Shelly... 
 Shelly wants me gone. He says I bring you luck. Lady luck. I stayed... to tell you to your face... and then you wouldn't want me no more... and I could just go... 
 We gotta get you to the hospital. We'll talk about this later. 
 Just tell me one thing, Bernie. Tell me there's gonna be a later. 
 Ssshh. 
 Tell me again, Bernie. Tell me it's all gonna be okay. 
 Everything's gonna be fine. This is our time. This is you and me and we're going for it. 
 You look in the mirror, you don't like what you see, don't believe it. You look in my eyes. That's the only mirror you gonna need. Look in my eyes, Natalie. 
 I love you. Marry me? 
." 
 You don't have to do this, Bernie. 
 Yeah, I do. I have to tell him right to his face. I will not look over my shoulder for the rest of my life -- our lives. 
 Bernie, your chart... that first night. I wasn't being straight with you. It's the worst chart I've ever seen. There's nothing in the cards for you. I'm scared... 
 Don't you see, that was before you opened your heart to me. Everything's different now. I got lady luck on my side. Ain't nothing gonna happen to me. 
 It's three thousand dollars. Take it. Maybe Shelly'll accept it as a down payment. We can send him the rest in installments... after we get settled. 
 I don't think -- 
 Take it. 
 Whatever happens, I -- 
 (abrupt) I know, Bernie. 
 (sotto; gentle) I know. 
 You lay another finger on her, I swear to God I'll kill you. You hear me? I'll fuckin' kill you! 
 (a hoarse whisper) Why? Why, Shelly? 
 He ain't never comin' back. 
 I'm through with this joint, Shelly. Natalie and me, we just got married. We're outta here. I'll get a job out there in the world. Send you half my paycheck every month. Make good on my obligations. 
 I don't think so. 
 You whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't the world's biggest loser no more. That honor's gonna fall upon you, Shelly. And maybe you had it all along. 
 What you got? What do you got in your life besides this joint? 
 You got nothin', Shelly. This place -- your legacy -- it's a mirage. You turn your back and it don't even exist. There's no day, there's no night, it's all just one big fuckin' blur and it don't count for nothin'! 
 I feel real sorry for you. Yeah, you got this fear of germs thing. But it goes deeper than that. You can't get close to no one. On an emotional level. You're the worst kind of gambler there ever was: too scared to put his chips on the table. Too scared to open his heart... to extend any real kinda friendship. Always afraid it's gonna end out in the desert. Well, sweet fuckin' dreams, pal, 'cause I'm out and if that's where it ends, that's where it ends. 
 Change only... 
 Check change three thousand. 
 This a pleasure cruise, Bernie? 
 You could say that. 
 Well, it'll be a short one. Table's dead. 
 It is now, anyway. 
 Yo Eleven! Pay the line. 
 Winner seven! 
 Six easy. Easy way six! 
 (sotto) Natalie... this is you... 
 For the boys. 
 Okay, we're coming out. Get your YO bets, C&E, any seven... 
 Shelly, take a look at number 4. 
 Around three hundred thousand. 
 We tried. You weren't picking up. Besides, it was Bernie. 
 Alright. We're coming out folks, hands high... 
 Wait! 
 Color me up a hundred fifty thousand. (beat) And give it to him. 
 That's what I owe you, Shelly. There it is. We're square. (to the table) Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives up to his obligations. 
 One hundred fifty thousand, coming in. 
 What's the matter with you? He's one of ours and he's taking us to the fucking cleaners. 
 It smells wrong. I'm shutting him down. He's not leaving here with a dime -- 
 Crap ace deuce! Line down! 
 Call it. 
 Twelve crap. 
 Fifty thousand dollars! 
 (O.S.) On the field? What're you fucking nuts? 
 (O.S.) Don't do it! 
 2 (O.S.) Shake it, don't break it, baby! 
 Come on sixty-six! 
 Thank God... I thought for sure... 
 It's okay, right? You guys worked it out. He took the three grand? Tell me it's okay, Bernie? 
 Want me to get that, Shelly? 
 What are you stopping for? 
 I think I'm gonna... 
 Bahamas, here we come, baby. 
 Step out of the car please. 
 (lowers the window) What's the problem, officer? 
 Just step out of the car, please. Both of you. 
 If my driving... if I was going a little fast -- I was just over excited, officer. See, we just had a big win at the Shangri-la -- 
 You didn't win nothing. 
 Oh Jesus, Bernie, I knew it. It was too good to be true. Who were we kidding? 
 Get down on your knees. Both of you. 
 He was drunk. It was just freak luck... (catches himself...) 
 Don't give it a name, Bernie. It scares me. All I know is, you're still running hot and that's a good thing. But we're only winners if we keep going. No looking back. 
 Lady luck, Natalie. I'm calling it. Lady luck. And we got it as long as we're together. They can't touch us now.

 "DRAGONSLAYER" 
 
 CASTLE - NIGHT 
 
 
 Omnia in duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in Nihil: Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt. 
 Come on, candles, out! 
 In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi: Lux! Exstinguat! 
 
 
 Vide, Magister. There's something wrong. 
 What's the matter? What's happened? 
 To me? 
 BARNYARD - DAY 
 Of course. 
 Well, almost. 
 (a shrug) The first two chapters. 
 To tell the truth, I haven't dared try it. What's the point, anyway? 
 I hate books. I hate drill. I want a real task. 
 I don't hear anything. 
 Voices, singing on the road. 
 I don't see anything. 
 
 ROTUNDA - NIGHT 
 
 Here are your sticks. 
 You're in a morbid frame of mind. What's all this about dying? You don't even look sick. 
 My daughter, for one. 
 My sister... cousins... 
 Master, don't you think -- 
 COURTYARD - DAY 
 Look at yourself. How far will you get like that? A league, two leagues? 
 (sarcastic) Why don't you wave your hands around and summon up a coach-and-four? 
 You pilgrims: You're used to lotteries. Why not draw straws to see who'll be first to carry ironshanks here. 
 Hold your tongue. If the master's got a mind to go, he'll go. 
 Send me. You're always saying I need seasoning. I need a test. Let me go. 
 I'm ready for anything. 
 
 What do you want with us? 
 Aye, this be the place of Ulrich. 
 You'd best keep your distance -- and your manners. 
 Aha -- it's a test you're looking for. We don't do tests. 
 And you're not going to get one. 
 
 ULRICH'S VOICE (impatient) Where are you, boy? I'm waiting. 
 Not this one, was it? 
 
 
 
 Hodge -- what are you doing? 
 Just making my farewell, thank you very much. 
 HILLTOP - DAY 
 Be careful with that! You don't know what you're doing. 
 Stand back! 
 Cragganmore! Domus non i am! Silva celet! 
 
 GALEN & HODGE 
 Oh, it's a vale of tears in which we dwell. It doesn't matter who you are, a king in his robes, a peasant in his rags, when your time comes, no magic can save you... 
 I guess... 
 ...the kindest lord a man could ask for... now he's gone. Ye gods he was fussy about his bath. And you'd think he could boil his own eggs with the snap of a finger, but no, he had old Hodge do it, of course. (snurfling) Up before five I was, mucking out the cages, slopping the pigs, and never once got so much as a thankyou or a pat on the back... (through tears) I'm going to miss him. 
 Me too... 
 No you don't. All you care about is the tricks and knavery. Well, you don't pull any wool over these old eyes. It'll be a mighty long walk before you fill his shoes, you mark my word. 
 What's the matter, Hodge, pack too heavy? Here. 
 Careful with that! 
 Too cold, is it? 
 Stop it! 
 Too warm? 
 (spluttering) Stop it, I say! Out of respect for the master! 
 I've got as much respect for the master as anyone, old man. But -- then again, I'm master now. 
 I left my farm with seeds unplanted, calves unborn, nothing but a wife to chase down the strays, and for what? A funeral, that's what. 
 Because some people said, find a magician. Not just a local fellow, an import, a good forty leagues from home. An all-powerful necromancer. Ha -- some necromancer! 
 Hold your tongue, Greil. Sit. Eat. 
 I'll not sit. I'll not eat. See you the Great Bear. His tail points east. It's the equinox. Have you forgotten? Or rather not think about it? 
 Good morrow, good morrow. Peace be with you. 
 Easy now. We mean no harm. We've been looking for you. 
 (growl) Well, you've found us. 
 (brushing himself off) More the other way around, I'd say. 
 A few words, that's all. You were looking for a conjurer. 
 Right. Requiscat in pace. (he takes a deep breath) Ecce: magister novus! 
 How say you? 
 My lord Ulrich is no longer. All that you asked of him, you may now expect of me. The dangers he would face, I will now conquer. The task he would undertake I will now fulfill. I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor of Ulrich's craft and knowledge, and I am the Sorcerer you seek. 
 Well, that's a handsome thought, O wizard of wizards. But if there's one thing our friend Tyrian has shown us, it's to beware the pig in the poke. Who's got a dagger? 
 No tests!! 
 Call it proof, then. 
 Well I haven't. All I've seen is death. Death in our families, death on the road, and tonight, death at home. 
 I don't like it. Young snot-nose comes in here for sport at our expense. We're on a fool's errand, but we don't have to listen to this. I don't want to hear any more about sorcery. I don't want to hear any more about spells. 
 (nods) What's the matter with him? 
 Close enough! Bring her out! 
 Now be it known throughout the kingdom, that this maiden, having lawfully been chosen by a deed of fortune and destiny, shall hereby give up her life for the greater good of Urland. 
 By this act shall be satisfied the powers that dwell underground and the spirits that attend thereto. In gratitude for this sacrifice His Majesty has declared the family -- what's the name? -- 
 Plowman! The family Plowman! 
 (rushing it) -- the family Plowman to be free of obligations, taxations, levys and imposts for a period not to exceed five years... 
 -- ordained and signed this day, etc., Casiodorus, in his glory the reigning king of this our realm... his seal, his mark, duly read by Chancellor Horsrik in his holy name. 
 FOREST - DAY 
 There. I see them. 
 Where? Which one? 
 Filling in for the chief, I reckon. 
 
 What have you got there? 
 None of your business. 
 A little gold, eh? What do you say I change it into lead? 
 Save your jokes for someone else. Me, I don't care for braggarts. 
 And I don't care for frauds. 
 I'm no fraud. 
 Call it fool then. Upstart. Whatever pleases you. 
 Hodge, nobody forced you to come along. 
 Oh, I'm here of my own free will, all right. We each do the master's bidding in our own way. 
 Well, if he told you I needed wetnursing, why don't you just turn yourself around and go back home. 
 Home, is it? You've seen to that, haven't you? Gone to seed, I'd say... 
 
 
 You're too far behind us. Come on out. 
 Not a good idea to get separated. Let's go. 
 
 By the gods! 
 I'm not going to say anything. 
 (feeble bluff) Take it easy. I knew the moment I saw you. I've known the whole time. 
 Don't worry. No one's going to find out. Just tell me: why? 
 The lottery! Daughters are chosen, but sons are not! 
 What do you mean? 
 (horrified) No! 
 
 No! 
 Hodge! 
 
 Galen? Can you hear me? 
 I hear you. 
 You know, somebody shot me, but I can still talk. There's something that has to be done. 
 I know. 
 Not that cockatrice. Ulrich's ashes. Here. 
 Take it. Sorry, you'll have to peel it loose. 
 (a croak) ...burning water... find the lake, throw it in... 
 (holding up the pouch) What are you doing with this, Hodge? 
 ...burning water... 
 Hodge, don't die. Listen to me. You're not going to die. 
 Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam! (he shakes the body) Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam! 
 LAKE - DAY 
 
 Urland! 
 The whole kingdom like this? 
 Where? 
 I see it. Let's have a look. 
 Look, you don't have to do this. We know you're a fine young magician. None better. There's no need to prove it to us. 
 Are there other entrances? 
 Come on. The road's this way. We'll tell everybody how close you got. 
 (coolly) No smoke. How do you know it's in there? 
 Don't be a fool. Come away now and live to tell about it. 
 
 Now, great mountain, hear my command: Terrae lapsus consignet latibulum draconis! Evanescat latibulum draconis! 
 
 
 VILLAGE - DAY 
 
 Now are you cleansed of your sins! Now are you born again, purified in spirit, into the fellowship of Jesus Christ! 
 Welcome back, my son. 
 Some have. 
 It's this monk. He can read and write, and talk too, I'm afraid. 
 Shh! They think this a holy place, a tabernacle. 
 You were brave to go, you and your friends. But nobody cares. Listen -- he knows what they want to hear. 
 
 The man who walks with Christ is not a man to fear a dragon: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil! You say you are preyed upon by a foul beast. Yes, but what is the nature of this beast? It comes to you on bat's wings and clawed feet, does it not? It breathes fire, does it not? And it lives under ground. This is no dragon. This is Lucifer! 
 Whoever it is, he's dead. 
 Nay, brother! It is not as easy as that. Allegiance to Christ, to be sure, but also prayer and confession. These are the arms by which Satan may be put down. 
 You're talking about superstition, friend. None of that has anything to do with what I, Galen, have already achieved. 
 (to Valerian) You brought this stranger? 
 People of Urland! Send a messenger to the king. Vermithrax is dead. Crushed by the power of the moon and the stars! Laid low by ancient wisdom. Dropped into the Abyss by mystical practice. 
 Spoken like a pagan. Every word as reprobate as it is false! (holding up his cross) Solum in hoc signo vinces! 
 Nihil plus mysterium! 
 Praise God! Blessed is he that is humble before the Lord! 
 We saw it with our own eyes. He flew to the mountain top. He was a bird. He brought forth lightning. I saw it. 
 
 VALERIAN'S HOUSE 
 Put that away. What if you were seen? 
 No, you mustn't do that. It's too soon. We've got to think about this, we've got to make a plan. 
 I know. What am I going to say to my friends who still mourn for their lost girls. 
 
 
 Looks like you've been up to a little sorcery yourself. 
 Or is it witchcraft? 
 What's the matter? A real woman never stops talking. 
 SIMON & GREIL 
 The damnedest thing is, she was twice the man of anyone else in the village. Now she's twice the woman. 
 (grim) Would that I had been as clever as her father. 
 Come now, Greil. Don't begrudge a life spared. 
 I begrudge nothing. But I wonder at what we have seen and how it was done. 
 You were there. 
 I saw what I saw. But this jack-anapes was barely ready to carry his master's chamberpot. Isn't it strange that at the very moment the beast is put down we should have a holy man here in the village? 
 You don't believe that superstitious Christian rot, do you? 
 (defensive) It is said God works his wonders in mysterious ways. 
 
 What would you have of us then? 
 (sobering up) What sort of gratitude? A knife in the belly? An arrow in the back? 
 Don't worry. I'll be back. 
 
 One of the best things about the water here in Urland is that there's so much of it -- look at that! 
 Mmm. Good. But not cold enough. Perhaps I could borrow a scarf from his Majesty. 
 I cover the goblet, so... remove, so... and behold: winter in a mug! 
 All right. How many of you have ever seen a table fly? 
 Enough! That's fine. 
 Wait, it'll rise now. 
 Don't bother. Not necessary. 
 Tell me: the landslide -- it was accomplished this same way? 
 Yes. 
 I see. And having rendered such unique service to our kingdom, what would you claim as a reward? 
 Please -- no payment. I have always found magical practice to be its own reward. I seek only some yet greater challenge. 
 Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric? Of course not, you weren't even born. He was my brother, a great King and a valiant man-at-arms. When he ascended to the throne, the dragon was unbridled. No one knew where it might strike next. So he brought forth his broadsword and his spear, assembled a company of his best fighters and went out to do battle. (pause) He was never seen again. But his attack provoked the most terrible reprisals: whole villages incinerated, entire crops burned. Death, famine, horrible. 
 (quietly) How did you arrogate to yourself the role of savior? 
 I was invited. 
 Not by me. Did you ever consider the consequences of failure? 
 What failure? What's the matter with you people? You want the dragon back? 
 Then the beast is dead? 
 Yes, of course. Dead. 
 We shall see. 
 
 
 
 (authoritative) Cubiculum gravis aperat! 
 Open up, dammit! Fenestra gravis aperat! Asser gravis aperat! Divinitus! 
 Salve, magistrum iuvenilum. 
 I've studied Latin. Greek, too. Me appelo Elspeth, filia regis. 
 How do you do. 
 Please don't think ill of us. My father is a wonderful man, a wise man. The lottery was his idea. 
 I see. 
 You don't understand. From the moment it began, the dragon was tame. The kingdom prospered. 
 And only a few had to be sacrificed. 
 Yes, that's true. Isn't it better that a few should die that many might live? 
 Depends on who does the dying. 
 Oh, but we all take our chances. My father is a just man. My name is entered on the lists, along with every other young -- 
 Virgin? 
 Maiden. 
 If you say so. 
 What do you mean? 
 (sighs) Nothing. 
 I've participated in every drawing since I came of age. 
 Maybe. 
 It's true. You don't believe me. You think I'm lying. Well I'm not. 
 I'm sorry. I heard a rumor. Families with money, that sort of thing. 
 Don't listen to rumors. They're lies. I have to go now. 
 Wait -- how long do I have to stay in here? 
 Until we know. Not long. Goodbye. Vale. Dormi bene. 
 
 That's enough. Let's not be greedy here. 
 Now then: I, Casiodorus Rex do hereby command thou base metal to change thy essence and become gold. 
 Father? 
 Not now. Tyrian, remove all but one bar. We'll try it one at a time. 
 Father: did you know that some families have paid bribes to stay out of the lottery? 
 Nonsense. By the power of this amulet, justly wielded by my hand in accordance with the laws of Urland, now lead be thou gold. 
 I'm burned! What devilish thing is this? 
 Have you ever kept my name off the lottery list? 
 That'll be all, Tyrian. You may withdraw. 
 Now, my dear, what's troubling you? 
 Answer my question: am I not exposed to the same risk as every other man's daughter? 
 Well? 
 (finally) Your father loves you very much. 
 (a wail) It's true! What have you done to me!? 
 Who fills your head with such ideas? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tyrian! Tyrian! 
 So much for your magic! So much for your sorcery! 
 Listen to me, my brethren. The moment of our fear is the moment of our triumph. This is a sign from God. Follow me, and our faith will send this creature straight to hell. 
 You call yourselves Christians? 
 The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. Thou makest me to lie down in green pastures. Thy rod and staff they comfort me... 
 
 (firm) ...for Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever -- amen. 
 Unclean beast, get thee down! Be thou consumed by the fires that made you! 
 VILLAGE - NIGHT 
 Get away, you little bastard. We've had enough help from you. 
 This is your doing! 
 Get him! He's back! 
 Greil -- help! 
 May the Lord forgive you for what you have done. 
 VALERIAN'S HOUSE 
 It's me. Are you hurt? 
 I can't. 
 I can't do it. 
 I just can't. 
 I'm no sorcerer. Whatever power I might have had, it's gone. 
 I know: I'm an imposter. A fraud. A fake. I'm sorry... 
 VALERIAN'S HOUSE 
 (returning her look) Damn right. 
 But it's months til the solstice. 
 I've never taken part in your cursed lottery, and I'll have nothing to do with it now. 
 Nothing. If he was here, he's gone now. 
 All right. I know what you want. How much? 
 Yes. 
 Smith -- have you ever forged a weapon? 
 
 These are your sharpest? 
 Even Tyrian carries one of these. 
 It's sharp -- but it's not sharp enough. 
 For what I'm going to do with it. 
 The best I ever made. 
 Don't do that! (he looks at Valerian) Girl-child, when you were born I knew I had to do something, so I set about the task of fashioning an extraordinary weapon: I had the skill to make it -- (bleak pause) -- but not the nerve to use it. 
 STREAM - DAY 
 Valerian, this isn't just for your sake. 
 
 Oh, it'll bleed, all right. 
 I'll need the amulet. 
 I know. We've met. 
 (reading) People of Urland: whereas the peace of the kingdom has been disrupted by the mischief of an interloper; and whereas this interloper being fled; now therefore, his majesty the King hereby proclaims the sum of thirty ducats to be paid to anyone producing the miscreant Galen Bradwardyn, fraud enchanter, to our satisfaction. 
 Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles! 
 Bare the arm! Bare the arm! 
 Draw the name! Draw the name! 
 Now, my countrymen, hear me: behold, for I am chosen. I shall die that many may live. I shall lay down my life for family and fellows. I shall go to my grave for the love of our King and his wise policy. And my name is -- 
 The name! The name! 
 Read the name. 
 (mastering himself) The name is: Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, filia regis. 
 That's not the name. It's been misread. 
 No, the good Horsrik has misspoke himself. (he looks at the tile) In fairness to this individual, whose name I can't make out, we'll destroy this tile. 
 Silence! We will have a new choosing. I will draw the name myself. 
 Let it stand! Let it stand! 
 The name is as you heard it and as Horsrik read it: Elspeth. 
 The lottery is invalid. Another and another. What treachery is this? 
 Hear me, good people! It is true, that my name appears on many of the lots. This does not falsify the drawing, it certifies it! I have learned that my name has been kept from jeopardy in all the drawings in the past. So I have put my name among the rest many times -- once for each risk that, over the years, you took and I did not. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Don't go to all that trouble. 
 I'm unarmed. If you want a fight, at least give me a weapon. 
 Stop! Don't harm him. (to Galen) And you -- don't run away... please... 
 (shaky) I've always had the greatest admiration for the black arts. You chaps with your mysterious spells... I didn't think it would be necessary, you see. Vermithrax is an old dragon. And that, I thought, was the beauty of my plan -- buying time. We'd wait her out. I'd live to see the end of her. (firm) That's still going to happen. 
 He shall have it. (pleading) It's my daughter. Save her, I beg you. 
 VILLAGE - DAY 
 Holy of holies -- he did not die in vain. Can you hear me, brothers? 
 (gently) We hear you, Greil. 
 Well and good, but I'm Greil no longer. Call me Gregorius, after the Bishop of Rome. 
 I saw him die. Like Our Lord Jesus on the cross he was, scourged by evil. But he showed no fear. Such is the power of the Holy Ghost. 
 
 Of what avail is magic? The old gods died with our daughters. From whence comest my help? My help comest from the Lord! 
 Good and hot. 
 Don't bother. That's not the kind of fire we need. 
 Nunc, per Potestatem Hermeticum -- ex flammis, ferrum sangrinarium! 
 STREAM - DAY 
 An edge like no other on this earth. 
 Well done, Simon. Thank you. 
 (grave) I'll say goodbye to Valerian for you. I'm sorry she's not here, but you know how she is. 
 I understand. 
 Fare thee well. 
 Thank you. 
 Hatchlings. They'll have to be killed too. Anything else? 
 (slowly nodding) Yes. 
 Who is? What do you mean? 
 And you'll be eligible because -- 
 I am in love. But not with the Princess. 
 Now be it known throughout the kingdom, that the Princess, having been chosen by a deed of fortune and destiny -- 
 No fire, I beg you. 
 Be gone! 
 (over his shoulder) I declare these proceedings duly ordained... 
 I've got plenty of reasons to kill you that have nothing to do with this sacrifice. 
 Let it be! Please! Tyrian is right -- it's our only hope! 
 Tyrian -- both of you -- run! Flee! It's coming! 
 Run! Get out of here! 
 No! Stop! What are you doing? 
 DRAGON'S LAIR 
 Elspeth! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Still alive. 
 
 She's right. What kind of a life could you have here? It's too late for me, but you're young enough. (he shows them the sword) You know what I think? Magic is dying out, fading from the world. But that makes me happy. That means the dragon will be dying too. 
 Nothing. I was just thinking -- poor Hodge. 
 STREAM - DAY 
 Hurts. That thing was small, but its teeth were sharp. 
 But the big one's alive. Somewhere down in that burning lake. 
 
 You old trickster! The burning water! The lake of fire! 
 He had it planned. He knew this was going to happen. 
 We've got to go back, I want to talk to him! 
 The Church is mother to us all. Not just one lonely orphan who has lost his way, not just a few, but all of us that believeth in Him. When enough voices come together in prayer, He shall hear, we shall live and the beast shall die. 
 He couldn't walk -- he knew he couldn't make the journey. So he had us make the journey for him! Don't you see? 
 (brought up short) What? Why? No you're not, this is my job. Absolutely not. 
 
 Stay close. 
 Never mind. Come on. 
 All right. Wait here. 
 Ex favilla, vita nova! 
 
 Be calm. He watcheth over us! And this is His sign! Let us pray! Our Father who art in heaven... 
 Ulrich! Magister! Over here! I can see you! Over here! 
 Wonder of wonders -- you're back! I thank the powers that made me! 
 Food? 
 GALEN & ULRICH 
 Wait, I have something to tell you. 
 No it can't. Listen: I thought I was a sorcerer -- but I wasn't. I thought I had power -- but I didn't. I thought I was you -- but I'm not. 
 
 
 Anything! 
 No! 
 I can't. 
 
 Make haste, brother. 
 Now be thou baptized in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. May the Lord our God light our way. 
 
 GALEN & VALERIAN 
 Not if it means killing him. 
 GALEN & VALERIAN 
 No! You can't! 
 
 
 GALEN & VALERIAN 
 
 Let us pray. 
 We thank thee, Lord, for this divine deliverance. Verily is thy presence amongst us, fully manifest in this, thy great work. 
 Arise, children of the Lord and forsake evermore the pagan mysteries. Rejoice in the true power of the Christian God! 
 FLENSING - DAY 
 (loud) All hail Casiodorus Rex -- Dragon slayer! 
 (nodding) Hail and praise be! 
 No. I'm fine. 
 Yes. 
 That too. 
 Yes? 
 A horse. 
 No. It must have been wandering loose. Or wild.

 ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure insanity. 
 MIA (CONT'D) (reading now) Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know... 
 #1 This doesn't taste like almond milk. 
 Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it -- 
 #1 Can I see the carton? 
 CUSTOMER #1 (CONT'D) I'll have a black coffee. 
 Cappuccino, please. 
 On us. 
 No, I insist. 
 Shit. 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 It's -- five past... 
 You'd better be here early tomorrow. 
 Ok. 
 MIA (CONT'D) And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know... Revision                      4. 
 MIA (CONT'D) No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you waiting `til Denver to tell her...? (as her smile contracts) Oh. I see... (silence; she clenches her jaw...) No, you're right. I understand. (...and a tear falls from her eye) Ok... I just... Oh... 
 MIA (CONT'D) (crying now) No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just -- 
 One second. 
 Holy Mother of God. 
 TRACY (CONT'D) Ever heard of a vent? 
 I wanted to give you an entrance. 
 (appearing in the hall, 26, eating Cheetos) Mia! How'd it go? 
 Eh... 
 Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel? 
 I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. 
 They're the worst. 
 I don't know if they were there. 
 I bet they were. Revision                           6. 
 (appearing, 27) Why is there a convention in the bathroom? 
 Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right? 
 Can't. Working. 
 (O.S.) What? (we PAN BACK to Tracy) Did she say "working"? 
 (opening up) Yes? 
 Look, I know things didn't go well today. There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. But right now -- you're coming. 
 TRACY (CONT'D) It'll be fun. 
 It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses. 
 Exactly. Fun. 
 Come on, Mia. When else do you get to see every Hollywood cliché crammed into a single home? 
 (faux-offended) Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's nothing to make fun of. This party will be humanity at its finest. 
 A10  . 
 C13   
 (O.S.) No... 
 MIA (CONT'D) No... 
 A17   
 B17   
 You think Mom or Dad would call this a home? 
 Are you serious? 
 I wonder why. (then, rising,) I brought you this. It's a throw rug. 
 Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it? 
 When are you going to unpack these boxes? 
 Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her. (then, looks at him --) You're not still going by there, are you? 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) They've turned it into a tapas-samba place. You believe that? 
 Seb -- 
 I have someone I want you to meet. 
 You'll like her. 
 Probably not. 
 You'll talk about the weather. 
 Sebastian -- 
 You need to get serious. You live like a hermit. You're driving without insurance. 
 You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got ripped off. 
 It's not as romantic as that. (she starts to walk off) And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you. 
 Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her. 
 I love you. Unpack your boxes. 
 (out the door with a smile --) You can't afford it. 
 B23   
 Seb. 
 Your welcome. Stick to the set list. Revision                       14. 
 I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. 
 Well... Welcome back. 
 SEBASTIAN'S THEME] 
 ...every goddamned night. 
 Too late. You're done. 
 (leans in, and --) Do you think anyone here gives a shit? 
 I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- 
 
 MIA (CONT'D) I don't like the fissure on the GT scan. Did you test for achromatopsia? 
 MIA (CONT'D) D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights. 
 MIA (CONT'D) This is my classroom. You don't like it, the door's to my left. 
 (O.S.) (a well-dressed forty-year-old WOMAN reading from sides) Lady why you be trippin' like that? 
 No, Jamal. You be trippin'. 
 There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer. 
 CARLO                           TRACY Nice to meet you, Mia.          He's got projects all over town. 
 (shrugs, faux-modest) They say I have a knack for world-building. 
 (takes this in; then --) Congratulations. I have to grab a drink... Revision                        17. 
 Alright, one more for y'all before we break. Do I hear any requests? 
 "I Ran". 
 "I Ran" it is. (to Sebastian) Wanna start us off, piano-man? 
 SINGER (CONT'D) I walked along the avenue... 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) And I'm sorry if I was curt that night. 
 "Curt"? 
 Ok. 
 My God. Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"? 
 Can I borrow what you're wearing? 
 Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. 
 Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic. 
 (popping in from nowhere) Sebastian. Second set. 
 He just told you what to do. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) What's your name? 
 Mia. 
 Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight... 
 ...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox and Warners are going crazy for it. 
 CARLO (CONT'D) ...We're going after Charlize. For the bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a franchise. But the thing is it's grounded. 
 (to Sebastian) George Michael! 
 Did you just get your keys? 
 Can you grab mine? 
 The Prius. 
 MIA (CONT'D) The one with the green ribbon. 
 MIA (CONT'D) (almost tripping in her heels) Shit... 
 They are...n't. 
 MIA (CONT'D) Thank you for saving the day back there. 
 Strange that we keep running into each other. 
 I doubt it. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Put the clicker under your chin. 
 What? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Oh my God. 
 MIA (CONT'D) Eh. 
 Agreed. I've seen better. 
 MIA (CONT'D) Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah, I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon... 
 MIA (CONT'D) Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride to your car? 
 ...Ok... 
 MIA (CONT'D) Night. 
 Are these pastries gluten-free? 
 No... 
 What?? I want a refund. 
 You're closing up Friday. 
 I have an audition. Remember? 
 Do I look like I care? Reschedule it. 
 But you said -- 
 And fix your apron. 
 ...Hi. (then) What are you doing here? 
 Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot? 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Actually it took me four hours and I ended up running. We probably have twenty minutes before the guy finds me. You got a break coming up? 
 I'm off in ten. 
 That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca. 
 Yeah. Greg. 
 We've been seeing each other for a few months. 
 MIA (CONT'D) I love this stuff. Makes coming to work easier. 
 Oh yeah? 
 A what? 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything and they value nothing. 
 (to Sebastian) We need to wait here. 
 Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca. (a beat; then,) I never knew the world was so big. 
 (O.S.) Cut! 
 I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year. 
 God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That would have been terrifying. 
 MIA (CONT'D) Honestly, I wish I loved something else. I've tried so hard to want other things. 
 MIA (CONT'D) I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C. (a beat; then, deadpan --) Should've been a lawyer. Revision                        27. 
 Well it doesn't need more actresses. 
 What do you mean, "just an actress"? 
 That is not what I said. 
 Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible. 
 Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead. 
 MIA (CONT'D) Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's something I should tell you... 
 I hate jazz. 
 It means when I listen to it I don't like it. 
 I do hate some animals. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Most people say they hate jazz because they don't have context. They don't get where it came from. All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other. 
 I thought it was just Kenny G. 
 I associate it with facials. It's relaxing. 
 (laying it on thick) Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) It's not cocktail music -- it's a high- wire act. These guys are performing and composing and rearranging all at once. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) That's why you need to be in the space and see what's at stake. This whole thing -- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll head off to cut commercial sessions or do pit at the Pantages `cause they have to -- but when I have my own place -- my club -- they'll play whatever they want. 
 Your club? 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) The world tells everyone to move on. Says the music's had its moment. But I love it too much. I'm not moving on. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) So? 
 Hi, I just missed a call... 
 MIA (CONT'D) I got a call-back! 
 That show I told you about. 
 Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You've seen it, right? 
 Obviously. (a beat; then --) No. 
 It's the one I lie about. 
 (considering this) ...Ok. Revision                          31. 
 Ok. (another nod, taking it in) For research. 
 MIA (CONT'D) Hi, Mom! 
 MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Hi, sweetie. How are you? 
 Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot. 
 MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oh my God! You're going to be on TV?? 
 Well -- it's not picked up yet. 
 MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Not picked up? 
 First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision                           32. 
 MIA'S MOM (O.S.) And you're in the pilot? 
 Well, no, I have a call-back. 
 MIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... Didn't you audition for a TV thing last week? 
 It's another audition. 
 MIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... So you might get a role in a thing that might one day be put on TV... 
 ...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment. 
 MIA'S MOM (O.S.) No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting. What channel? ABC? HBO? 
 Oxygen. 
 MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oxygen? 
 You know what, I have to go. I love you. 
 (O.S.) ...We'll be seeing you very soon. Revision                        33. 
 Mia Dolan? 
 Whenever you're ready. 
 Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied -- 
 Thanks. 
 I can do it another way -- 
 No, thanks, that was great. 
 MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Dad just helped me find Oxygen on the guide! So exciting! So will you be getting health insurance now? 
 Mia? 
 ALEXIS (CONT'D) (with difficulty) Greg's here... 
 Hey... I'm parked out front. But we should hurry, my brother just landed. 
 GREG (CONT'D) Did you forget? 
 Shit. No. Yes. I'll change... 
 (smiles) It's ok. 
 GREG (O.S.) (CONT'D) Josh! Yep, just picking Mia up now. Will be there in twenty. 
 That's right -- but now we've got a surround-sound set-up, so it's like -- 
 It's like being in a movie theater. 
 It's better than going to a theater, really. You know theaters these days -- 
 Oh, sure -- 
 -- they're so dirty, and they're either too hot or too cold, and there's always people talking, which is just -- (his phone buzzes) -- just so annoying, I mean you're trying to watch a movie -- one second -- (opens phone) Hello?... 
 Probably work. 
 Yeah, I'll have to call you back. (closes and pockets his phone) So, yeah, we love it. 
 JOSH (CONT'D) One word for you. Nicaragua. 
 I've never heard anyone say that. Was it amazing? Revision                          36. 
 Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort. It was unbelievable. 
 Mia? 
 I'm sorry. 
 MIA (CONT'D) I have an idea. 
 --. 
 (O.S.) What's that? 
 TRACY (CONT'D) Is that a script? 
 It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself. 
 (O.S.) (chiming in from her bedroom) A play? You better give us roles! 
 Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show... 
. 
 ...Is that gonna happen every time? 
 (glowing) I think so. 
 A60   
 MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) It's one-way!! 
 
... 
 (O.S.) Sebastian? 
 Holy shit. Come here, man. 
 KEITH                           MIA Hey, Mia.                         Hey... 
 So how've you been? 
 Keeping busy. Got a new combo. 
 ...Looking for keys. 
 You sure? It pays. 
 Let's just grab a drink then. Call me. It's been too long. 
 Nice meeting you, Mia. Revision                           42. 
 Nice meeting you. 
 ...You're just saying that. 
 I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic? 
 But do you think people will like it? 
 (laughs) You always say that. 
 Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise. 
 I made something for you. 
 It could be the name design. On the door. 
 That's what you should name it. 
 Sebastian, no one's going to a club called "Chicken on a Stick". 
 No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz. (he rolls his eyes) And it's time to start looking for other places. 
 Make your own history. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) The whole world from your bedroom? Who's doing that? Revision                    44. 
 I'm doing that. 
 MIA (CONT'D) So who was that guy at the Lighthouse? 
 The one who offered you a gig. 
 Why was it weird between you two? 
 He did offer you a job. 
 Are you going to call him? 
 Ok... 
 (O.S.) ...No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... No, I'm acting in it as well... No, I'm not getting paid, I'm paying to do it... (then,) He's great... He's going to open his own jazz club. It's going to be incredible... (beat; then, softer --) Well he has to get the money together first, and... He's figuring it out... Yeah, it's just been a little tricky lately... 
 MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Look -- he's going to find a way to open it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's Dad? 
 Sebastian. 
 KEITH (CONT'D) Didn't know if I'd see you today. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Where's the piano? 
 Here's the deal. We've got distribution with Universal, got our own imprint. We're about to go on the road. We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus an equal share of any merchandise or ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good? 
 KEITH (CONT'D) Sebastian? 
 Let's play, see how it feels. 
. 
 KEITH (CONT'D) I know. It's different. 
 KEITH (CONT'D) But you say you want to save jazz. How are you going to save jazz if no one's listening? Jazz wouldn't exist if people hadn't gotten tired of what they were listening to before. (then,) I mean, do you really think a bunch of ninety-year-olds in a basement is the future of the form? Traditionalists whined when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs. If traditionalists had their way, we'd still be playing Dixieland. 
 I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't as good as you. But you're a pain in the ass, man. 
 KEITH (CONT'D) If it's not your thing, just let me know. I don't want you uncomfortable and trying to change this into something it's not. But if you want it -- the job's yours.

 SEBASTIAN                        MIA City of stars...              You've never shined so brightly. Revision                           50. 
... Revision                          51. 
 
 Look at him -- watch -- 
 LAURA (CONT'D) Now he's going to check the other window. Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check again. Yep, still closed. 
 Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two want anything? 
 Thanks Harry, I'm good. Revision                       52. 
 Same here but I think someone's trying to break into your car. 
 LAURA (CONT'D) Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now? 
 I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure... 
 You should come over tonight. Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you. (Mia manages a smile; a beat) What's the matter? 
 Nothing... 
 You miss him. 
 I guess. I'm adapting. 
 (nods; then,) I got used to being alone. Growing up it was just me and Seb. We only had each other. 
 He told me. 
 I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met Harry and -- we just fit... (Mia smiles) You've changed Seb. You know that? 
 Do you think he's happy? 
 Is he happy? 
 I mean with the band, the travel, all of it. Revision                        53. 
 Our dad never got to do what he wanted. We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record. (a beat) So I look at Sebastian... Playing music, getting paid for it. I'm happy for him. 
 LAURA (CONT'D) Dreams change. 
 LAURA (CONT'D) Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon. 
 LAURA (CONT'D) I told you not to get me anything! 
 Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess. 
 No -- I changed my mind. 
 Hey it's me... Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I haven't heard from you in a while... I miss you... (a beat) Ok... Bye... 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) And... (he hurries to the kitchen -- and holds up a big apple pie) There's twenty-five pounds of apples in it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem but it tastes good. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I have to head back in the morning but I needed to see you. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Feels so good to be home. 
 Stay. 
 I'm nervous. Revision                 55. 
 Because... (a beat) What if people show up? 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You're nervous about what they think? 
 I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. I'm terrified. 
 I can. 
 MIA (CONT'D) What time do you leave in the morning? 
 Ugh. 
 Boise? 
 To Boise? Revision                     56. 
 Wish I could. 
 Come to Boise? 
 Because I have to rehearse. 
 You mean anywhere you are? 
 Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical... 
 I know, but when are you done? 
 When are you done with the tour? Revision                   57. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) We tour so we can make the record, and then we go back on tour to sell the record. 
 So it's...the long haul? 
 I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time. 
 I don't know, I didn't think the band would -- 
 No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now? 
 Do you like the music you're playing? 
 It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years. Revision                    58. 
 Yes. I do. (beat) I just didn't think you did. 
 And now I hear you're going to be on the road for years, and I'm -- 
 What do you mean why am I doing this? 
 To be in this band? 
 Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club. 
 Why aren't you starting your club? 
 Change the name! 
 I do like jazz now, because of you. 
 People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know? This is what I'm doing. If you had a problem, I wish you would've said something earlier, before I signed on the dotted line. 
 (trying again) You had a dream that you were sticking to, that -- 
 This is not your dream. 
 Why do you care so much about being liked -- ? 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Maybe you liked me more when I was a failure because it made you feel better about yourself. 
 Are you kidding? 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Wait -- 
 SEBASTIAN                          COLE See you tomorrow.                 See ya. 
 You good for tonight, right? 
 Seven. The photo shoot. (reading Sebastian's face, adding --) Mojo. 
 No. It's tonight. 
 KEITH (CONT'D) Is that ok? 
 Put a light on the drums... I need more fill in this corner... 
 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Bass, head up. Piano, look down at the keys. 
 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Cut the music. Turn the keyboard live. Piano look up, play. 
 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) No -- piano -- actually play something. 
 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Good, now bite your lip like you're concentrating on a solo. 
 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) That was good. Don't stop. 
 #1 (O.S.) I swear to God, if I have to hear one more hipster waxing nostalgic I'm gonna slit my wrists. 
 #2 (O.S.) Seriously. 
 #1 (O.S.) She's not even good. That window thing...? 
 #2 (O.S.) Christ... Don't quit your day job... Revision                       64. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry -- 
 Stop -- 
 It's over. 
 I'm done embarrassing myself. 
 No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater. 
 MIA (CONT'D) I'm gonna go home for a while. 
 Not anymore. 
 A111   
 You remember the McKenzies? 
 Yeah. They kept going, "oh Sebastian's so handsome". 
 You were great (pause) You're always great when you play. 
 LAURA (CONT'D) Now -- listen to me. I want you to save for a down payment. You understand? You need a home. 
 I'm not gonna be hovering anymore. 
 I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know, it's exciting... 
 LAURA (CONT'D) Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws... 
 LAURA (CONT'D) Is my...my hair...? 
 #2 (O.S.) Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan. 
 #2 (O.S.) -- She's not answering her cell and I was told I might find her here. 
 #2 (O.S.) Ok. If you do talk to her -- 
 #2 (O.S.) -- please tell her Jane at Amy Brandt Casting is trying to reach her. 
 MIA'S DAD You want some more rice? 
 I'm ok. 
 MIA'S DAD You look hungry. 
 I'm good... 
 MIA'S DAD It's fun having you back. Your mom ditches me at ten. 
 You took down the swing. 
 MIA'S DAD She made me. 
 Oh God. Throw those away. 
 MIA'S DAD Never. 
. 
 Why did you come here? 
 Ok... 
 I know who she is. 
 I'm not going. 
 I'm -- no... That will kill me. 
 Yes. Revision                    70. 
 I'm happier. 
 I told you. 
 (finally letting it out, fed up --) Because it's another audition! (a beat; then --) I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do you want to know what happens? Either they interrupt me because someone ordered a sandwich, or they cut me off after two seconds, or I'm crying and they start laughing, or I'm one of a hundred lookalikes in the waiting room who never has a chance, because -- (beat) -- because -- 
 Because I'm probably not good enough. 
 No. Maybe I'm not. 
 MIA (CONT'D) Maybe I'm one of those people who's always wanted to do it but never had a chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's like you said. Maybe I need to grow up. 
 MIA (CONT'D) I can go back to school. I can find something else that I'm supposed to do. I left school to give it a shot, and it didn't work out, and it took six years, and I don't want to do it anymore. 
 Why what? 
 ...Because it hurts a little bit too much. 
 How did you find me? 
 #2 Mia? 
 I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you. 
 We want to build the character with you. It's a process. Three-month rehearsal, four-month shoot. 
 ...Ok. 
 So why don't you just tell us a story? 
 ...About...? 
 About anything. 
 My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... (beat) I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once... 
 They said the next couple of days... But I'm not expecting to find anything out. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Where are we? 
 I mean -- where are we? 
 What do we do? 
 If I get this -- Revision                           75. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) It's your dream. 
 What are you going to do? 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz there. And you love jazz now. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Right? 
 Right. 
 You know I'm always going to love you. 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Look at this view. 
 (playfully) I've seen better. Revision                         76.

 Hi... Iced coffee, please.

 I got a check for you to sign. 
 Not too bad. Revision                          78. 
 See you tonight. 
 King Seb! 
 Like the desert misses the rain. 
 Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight. 
 That's not Edgar. 
 Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea. 
 Bye, Mrs. Dolan. 
 What if we miss this? What do we tell Natalie? Revision                      80. 
 We can just see it back in New York... 
 MIA (CONT'D) Do you want to just skip it...? Turn off here and get dinner? 
 Alright... 
 DAVID (CONT'D) This looks fun. 
 DAVID (CONT'D) Come on... 
 DAVID (CONT'D) Mia? 
 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Welcome to Seb's. 
 I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- 
 ...KISS. Revision                           85. 
 Do you want to stay for another?

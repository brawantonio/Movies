 Yeah, I'm just thinking about what I want. 
 I want a divorce. Creme Brulee. 
 I'm gonna getcha! I'm gonna getcha! 
 It's okay, my fault. (THEN) Alright, kiddo, it's getting late, let's get you to bed before your parents get home. Don't give me the puppy eyes, you little maniac. Go brush your teeth! 
 I don't care. I love him and given the opportunity, I'd have his babies. 
 Seriously? Conan O'Brien? You'd do Conan O'Brien? 
 I'm just saying, Richard's a lot of things: successful, smart... 
 Boring, workaholic, sexually repressed... 
 But he's not very funny, that's all. 
 Yeah, well, you want funny, go watch `Cosby' reruns. You want a good lay, go get yourself some of... that. 
 What? 
 The hot piece that's been checking you out for the last hour. 
 Aren't you going to say anything? 
 Almost twenty-five years of marriage, you have nothing to say? 
 Hey, your sister's asleep, just checking you're alive -- 
 
 Close the door! 
 
 (THROUGH DOOR) I'm sorry, Robbie! I didn't see anything, I swear. 
 I don't know, Hannah. Your life is just so... PG-13. 
 My life is not PG-13! 
 It so is. You've never left LA. You pass the bar you're gonna be, what, a patent lawyer, probably married to that snooze-fest Richard. I just worry about you is all. Hell, you've resorted to fantasizing about Conan `Ginger- Dick' O'Brien. 
 (ADORABLE) He's funny. 
 He looks like a carrot, honey. 
 (O.S.) Who? 
 Hi. 
 Hi. Who looks like a carrot? 
 Conan O'Brien. My friend Hannah thinks he's sexy. 
 I think your friend Hannah is sexy. 
 You didn't really just say that. 
 Pretty sure I did. 
 How old are you? 
 Thirty-three next month. 
 Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work. 
 I find you incredibly sexy. It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line. (MORE) 
 JACOB (CONT'D) There are many attractive women in this bar -- including your friend here -- and I've been unable to take my eyes off you, only you, for the past two hours. Again: not a cheesy pick-up line, just a fact. (THEN) Answer this quickly, without thinking about your answer: do you find me attractive? 
 I don't. 
 Yes you do. 
 Yes, she does. 
 I'm an accomplished lover. If you come home with me, I am confident you will leave satisfied. Multiple times. 
 You've got to be kiddi-- 
 We'll make love and it will be amazing. You'll laugh afterwards and say `I never do this kind of thing.' Then you'll do it again. 
 Is that so? 
 It is. So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink. If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you. 
 Multiple times. 
 That's right. So, here we go, Hannah: can I buy you a drink? 
 What do you expect me to say to that? 
 Margarita, rocks, salt. 
 Wow. 
 Okay, time to go. 
 I'll go home with you, you can call me Hannah, I don't give a 
 -- 
 Liz! 
 (whispering to him) Another time, maybe. 
 I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not to be. We've been married so long, somewhere we became... stagnant, you know? 
 Okay, you're not talking and you know that only makes me talk more. Maybe that's good, maybe that's good. Okay... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 8. 7 CONTINUED: 7 
 TRACY (CONT'D) (THEN) There's this person. 
 We've been spending time together. Lunches, meetings, that kind of stuff... 
 I slept with him. Kind of. 
 No, no kind of. I can't believe I said kind of. That's just not something you do in a kind of way. I slept with someone. There. I said it. I slept with someone. Oh God. It's the worst thing I've ever done but it feels so good to say out loud. I slept with someone. I SLEPT with someone. I slept with SOMEONE. I slept with ... please stop me, please say something. 
 David Jacobowitz. From work. You met him at the Christmas party. You remember that party? They had the giant paper-maché wreath? I kept asking the decorator how he made it? You wore that sweater -- 
 The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal -- 
 But the fact that I did, that it could happen at all, I think it just shows how broken we are and -- 
 Are you out of your mind!? 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry that you had to see that. 
 I should have knocked. (CONTINUED) 10. 9 CONTINUED: 9 Silence. After a long beat. 
 For the record: I think about you while I do it -- 
 Robbie! 
 I have a picture of you and I look at it the whole time -- 
 Stop it! 
 I love you, Jessica. And I know you're seventeen, and I know I just turned thirteen, which is the same age as your little brother, and you're technically my baby- sitter, but someday soon our age difference will be inconsequential which is good because... 
 
 -- 
 I'm pretty sure you're my soulmate. 
 Listen, Robbie -- 
 (O.S.) We're home. 
 Shit. 
 Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver. How was dinner... (NOTICING) Oh my God, Mr. Weaver, you're bleeding. Why are you bleeding? 
 Dad? 
 You're getting divorced? 
 Cal! 
 And you jumped out of a car? 
 Cal! 
 I'm sorry you jumped out of a car. 
 Uh-huh. 
 (WITH ENERGY) So, I hear Stanford early admission, huh. I know your dad is so proud. 
 Yeah. (THEN) You're bleeding real bad, Mr. Weaver. 
 It's okay. 
 Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years. You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 13. 10 CONTINUED: (2) 10 
 JESSICA (CONT'D) You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well... then I think she's batshit crazy. 
 In fact -- and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- I think I've even developed a 
-- 
 Uh-huh. 
 Another vodka cranberry? 
 What? 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 
 (RE: JACOB) Gay. 15. 
 So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2 is a lot like unit 1 except you're downstairs so... the ground is closer. Which is nice. 
 Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys here. You'll fit right in. 
 Ooh, the gym has an elliptical machine... I assume you want to get back in shape? 
 Great! I'll let you know when they fix it. 
 Cal, I just got the weekly sales report, good good good! You really killed this quarter! (MORE) 
 BOSS (CONT'D) Keep it up you're going to be sitting in my seat by year's end. Really great, Cal. Seriously. 
 (RELIEVED) Divorce! That's it. Amy heard you crying in the bathroom. We all thought it was cancer. Thank God. 
 Go for it! (then, calling after) It could have been cancer, buddy! 
 Can I help you, sir? 
 Ooh, I understand. Can I give you a word of advice, one divorced man to another? If you don't mind? 
 Get the matching chaise, killer deal. 
 I'll write you up. 
 You've been holding the seat for an hour. 
 Yeah. 
 Don't start conversations with people while they're pissing. 
 Sorry I'm late, I had to pick something up from Macy's. 
 Claire won't let me be friends with you anymore. 
 She said we had to choose between you and Tracy. I chose you. She said no. (CONTINUED) 19. 18 CONTINUED: 18 He pulls a WRAPPED PACKAGE from the bag, hands it to Cal. 
 It's cologne. 
 Claire's waiting in the car. Um... there's a gift receipt in there. Sorry. 
 
 Jacob Palmer. 
-- 
 I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal. 
 Let me buy you a drink, Cal. 
 David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard. We've all heard. For the last two nights, I've watched you batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story. 
 -- 
 Sit down, Cal. 
 Cal, I'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until I've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what I'm saying. Do you understand? 
 As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say, without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it. You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L -- I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal. 
 You asked me for advice before, Cal, so I'm going to help you. I don't know why. Maybe I'm just bored. Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why? Why doesn't matter. The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project. So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you remember when it was that you lost it? 
 Doesn't matter, we'll find it. And when we do, when I'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early. That's my offer. What do you say? 
 Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock. 
 You ready to go? 
 
 (O.S.) Cal? 
 I just wanted to say that... 
 Shit. 
 Do you want me to back that thing out of the driveway for you? 
 You have trouble in reverse is all. 
 Three if you count my father's foot. 
 I knew it. 
 I think I'm have a mid-life crisis maybe. Can women have mid-life crisis? 
 (AVOIDING ENGAGEMENT) Make sure the lawn gets enough water. 
 In the movies it's always men having them and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man and I really don't want a yellow 
 -- 
 We got married so young, Cal. And I'm forty-one. And that's so much older than I thought I'd be. 
 And I got really upset with an umpire at Molly's t-ball game last month -- like really upset, like I screamed at him and wished he would die -- and I started feeling like the person I promised I wouldn't turn into, you know? 
 And we haven't been us, not for a long time. And I don't know when you and I stopped being `us' but... I mean, do you? 
 So... you're like, actually going to live here? 
 CAL (CONT'D) But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron-- 
! 
 Don't take it personally. That show's like crack to her. 
 You okay? 
 Can I say something with a curse? One time? 
 Love is fucked. 
 Well, if you must know -- 
 (O.S.) Ding dong. 
 What is she doing here? 
 CAL (CONT'D) (back to Robbie) I have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking -- 
 What? 
 
 (CHANGING TOPICS) The place is... nice, Mr. Weaver. 
 But I don't need a babysitter! She's only four years older than me! You need to know that! She needs to know that! 
 Wait, where are you going? 
 That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before... 
 But, Dad -- 
 I don't need a baby-sitter. 
 I know, Robbie. 
 I love you so much -- 
 Jesus Christ. 
 I think you're wrong. I think that's Tucker. 
 No, no, no. Chris Rock is the stand-up comedian. Chris Tucker is the actor. 
 Is it racist that I can't tell them apart? 
 Well, Richard: thank you for inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye' party. The conversation has been riveting, like stepping back in time. Before I go, a toast. 
 Sweetie: go into your hole and study your cute little ass off for that bar exam. We'll see you when you emerge. 
 She's gonna kick that bar's butt! 
 Yeah, okay. (CONTINUED) 30. 23 CONTINUED: 23 Liz CHUGS her drink, turns to Hannah. 
 (SMILING) I'll walk you out. 
 Hey, Liz? When my girl passes, we're gonna have another little celebration, right here. Hope you can make it. It's going to be a special night. 
 Richard, you just give me a heads- up so I can get really drunk before-hand, okay? 
 You know it! 
 Did you hear that? `It's going to be a special night.' You think he's going to propose? 
 At the Cheesecake Factory? Oh God, I hope not. (THEN) Why? Do you really want him to? 
 He's nice. 
 Yeah, well... Jesus. Really? (with a shrug) Okay. Not my life, I love you, call me if you need anything. 
 You're late. (then, offering) Sbarro's? 
 How much money can you afford to spend on clothes today? 
 Three thousand. 
 We'll start with shoes. Let me see those sneakers you're wearing. 
 Take them off. 
 (CHEWING) Other one too, please? 
 Are you in a fraternity, Cal? 
 ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!? 
 Are you Steve Jobs? 
 ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF 
? 
 Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go. 
 Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items. 
 You did. I wrote it. 
 Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers. (CONTINUED) 33. 25 CONTINUED: 25 Cal is looking at a pair of ARGYLE SOCKS. 
 Your credit card please? 
 (V.O.) Two suits: one black, one grey. One sports jacket, navy preferred. 
 Take it in there... and there. 
 (V.O.) One pair of quality jeans. 
 No, Cal. We can't just go to the Gap. 
 In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal. 
 (V.O.) One pair of chinos. 
 (V.O.) Four dress shirts. 
 (V.O.) Three casual button-downs. 
 (V.O.) Two v-neck cashmere sweaters, and finally, a long overcoat. 
 You rub this in around your eyes every night and every morning. 
 (SARCASTIC) It gives you x-ray vision, Cal. (THEN) It tightens things up. The skin around your eyes looks like Milton Berle's ballsack. 
 Oh, okay. Thanks for that, Vidal Sassoon. Tiffany, hon? Scissor cut, tight on sides, get him some texture up top, take off about... He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers. 
 ... inch off the top. 
 Yes, sir. 
 What are you putting on? 
 Perfect. (then, to Tiffany) You smell great by the way. 
 
 (SMITTEN) Thanks. 
 What are you doing tonight? 
 I don't know. 
 That's okay, I do. 
 Yes, Cal, just like that. 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Wow. 
 Yep. 
 Shut up, Cal. (TO TIFFANY) You'd fuck him, right? 
 Yeah, probably. 
 You see that, Cal? The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you. Your personality is actually your weakest link. 
 No, Cal. The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover. 
 No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be calling women over to our table shortly. 
 Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids. Here's the only thing I need to know: how many women have you been with? 
 Yes. 
 No, synchronized swimming. Yes, Cal. Sexually. 
 Wow, okay... wow. (then, checking) Not at a time? Total? 
 Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go. 
 Shut up, Cal. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. Jacob Palmer. 
 Amy Johnson. 
 (QUICKLY) Don't. 
 Can I get you a drink, Amy? 
 Tell me about yourself. What do you do? 
 Does it really matter? 
 It does to me. 
 It does to me. 
 And that's when I started writing the column for LA Weekly. God, how long have I been talking? 
 Listen, I'm going to be honest: it's getting late and I think you're interesting. I also think you're one of those rare women who manages to be both wildly sexy and incredibly cute all at once. 
 
 Let's get out of here. I know it's forward of me but just... I think we should get out of here. 
 Okay. 
 I think we should get out of here. 
 Okay. FLASH CUT TO: 
 I think we should get out of here. 
 Okay. 
 (O.S.) While Hester is forced to wear a scarlet `A' as punishment for adultery, Reverend Dimmesdale's `A' is self-inflicted -- 
 (O.S.) Mr. Weaver? Are we interrupting? 
 (O.S.) Mr. Weaver! 
 You want to talk about The Scarlet Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you go: the `A' they're both wearing -- I think it stands for ASSHOLE. Wanna know why? Because they're in love, and love is for stupid ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs. Thompson, because this is what I need right now: to read a boring, confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love, like assholes, and then had to die, like assholes. I'm sorry for cursing. CUT TO: 
 You have a second? 
 Oh, David. I'm just a little swamped right now so... 
 You've been avoiding me. (CONTINUED) 44. 42 CONTINUED: 42 
 No, I haven't. 
 You ran away in the other direction when you saw me coming down the hall yesterday. 
 (BEAT) You're very fast by the way. 
 I ran track in high school. 
 That must be it. 
 I'm sorry about you and Cal. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm also not sorry, if I'm being completely honest. (GATHERING HIMSELF) I want to make sure you know how much I like you. 
 No, I do -- 
 A lot. Just to clarify. I like you a lot. I had no intention of falling for a married woman. I just wanted someone to go to lunch with who didn't make me want to shoot myself in the face. But we started having lunch, and talking, and suddenly I was an accountant who was popping out of bed in the morning, excited to get to work. That doesn't happen to accountants. Ever. I've checked with other accountants. 
 So when the time is right for you to get back out there again, officially, I just... I'd like to throw my hat in the ring. Officially. That sounded weird. 
 David, you've been a great friend to me. And you were the first man in a very long time to make me feel... noticed, I guess? What happened between us that night... it meant something to me. You weren't the only one excited to come to work lately. 
 But now, when I see you, all I see is his face. All I see when I look at you is what I did to my marriage. 
 You see this? I'm saving you from disaster, David, `cause you're asking to pre-board the Titanic. Honestly, do you really want any part of this? Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone. 
 (V.O.) Your son's school on two. 
 
 (INTO PHONE) Right, okay. No, I understand. Of course, right away. 
 (calling back in) Yes, of course. Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again. 
 Seriously? 
 Sorry. 
 It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I have to get back to work. 
 They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh? 
 You'd really think someone would have written something better by now. 
 Guess I should take it down, huh? 
 I guess. 
 How is he? I've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but... how is he, really? 
 Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me, I'm almost done here. 
 He's dressing a lot better. Going out a lot. 
 Oh. Well, good. That's... really good. (then, covering) We'll get take-out for dinner tonight, okay? Think about what you're in the mood for. 
 He's sad. He looks better, but... sadder, too, I think. You know? 
 Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad, too. 
 I know. 
 You do? 
 I heard you crying the other night and... I didn't know what to do. I'm thirteen years old and... can you just tell me what I'm supposed to do in that situation? I didn't want to Google it. 
 Oh God, baby, you're so much like me it's scary. You wound up with all my stuff, Robbie. I'm so sorry. 
 I'm okay with being like you, Mom. I like you. 
 It's my fault, what happened with your father. It's grown-up stuff that I can't talk about but... it's my fault. Not his. So just... be good to him, okay? 
 It'll be okay, Mom. 
 (EMOTIONAL) You promise? 
 (O.S.) Hey, they need you in the conference room for a sec... oh, sorry. 
 David, this is my son, Robbie. Robbie, this is David. (FORCED) We work together. 
 I'll be right back, okay, honey? 
 Okay. Okay. 
 So, Robbie... I hear you're quite the soccer player. 
 So, David... I hear you broke up my parents' marriage. 
 You are David Jacobowitz, right? From accounting? 
 Um, yes I am -- 
 Here's the thing, David: in the end, she winds up back with my dad. He's better than you, in every category except probably math. And she still loves him. 
 Listen, Robbie -- 
 Now I know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love?' I know a lot more than you think, David. Just today, I had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life. My dad's having his meltdown now, but long-term? He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than I won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable. And you need to know that. 
 You ready to go? 
 
 (SUDDENLY SWEET) Mommy, can we do Chinese for dinner tonight? 
 I think you're ready, Cal. 
 To talk to a woman, take a woman home. 
 You've been watching me do it for two weeks. 
 Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually building blocks for throwing and blocking punches? 
 Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down? 
 And what if she says no? 
 When she asks me a question about myself? 
 And what happens? 
 And what do I do? 
 And at the end of the night? 
 Do I ask? 
 Oh, and no talking about your job, your children, your pathetic sexual history, or David Jacobowitz. Okay, here we go... 
 Cal, this is Kate. Kate, Cal. 
 Really, thank you but it's okay. 
 Yes, I can but... I'm, uh, five years sober so... 
 What can I get -- 
 So... what do you do, Cal? 
 I asked you first. 
 Seriously, what do you do? 
 I'm a teacher. Now, c'mon: what do you do? 
 I'm sorry, are you not going to tell me what you do? 
 I should get back to my friends -- 
 What were you supposed to tell me? 
 You think I'm a perfect combination of sexy and cute? 
 Wow, an actual honest man. I don't know what to do with that. It's kind of... rare around here. (THEN) It's nice, actually. 
 You have no idea. I'm kind of a magnet for these jerk-offs. They charm me, and I fall for it, and at some point they just... never call me again. 
 (GENUINE) I don't understand. Look at you. Who wouldn't call you again? She looks up. It's not a line, it's a genuine compliment. She smiles warmly. Holy shit, Cal is in! 
 So... what were you `supposed' to do next? 
 Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens? 
 
 (PLAYFUL) Ask me again. 
 (TURNED ON) I love that you're being so honest. It's so different, so hot. 
 More, tell me more. 
 What do you want to do with me? 
 ... it would work! 
 What do college guys hate? Doing laundry. What do they love? Strippers. It's a strip club where they can do their laundry. 
 And yours isn't? A candy store that only sells red candy. 
 I like grape. 
 Oh, I almost forgot -- heard some good gossip at the nail salon. 
 For God's sake, Claire. 
 
 (SING-SONGY) It's about Cal. 
 Leave the poor bastard alone, would you? I gave him the cologne like you told me to. We don't have to dance on his grave. 
 (O.S.) What did you hear about Mr. Weaver, Mom? 
 Apparently, Mr. Weaver has become quite a man-about-town if you get my drift. 
 What? 
 Lots of young women coming in and out of his apartment lately. 
 Claire, would you cut it out? 
 It's good for Jess to know. She still baby-sits for him after all. 
 Oh, c'mon! Enough. 
 Well, it's good gossip at the least. Ooh, guess what else I heard... 
 Madison! Madison, wait! 
 Hey, I had a question -- 
 Hey, Jessica, whassup? 
 I had a question for you, Madison. It's kind of on the personal side so... 
 My lips are... 
 (EXPLAINING) Seals. (THEN) My lips are seals. 
 Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the thing... I don't mean to be blunt or insulting but, let's call it what it is: you're always sleeping with older guys, right? 
 (NODDING) Always. 
 Lots of college guys, I've heard. 
 Lots of them. 
 Even rumors about a few teachers. 
 Totally. 
 So my question is: how do you do that? I mean, how do you get them not to see you as... well, a kid in high school? 
 Oh, well first off, I have a huge rack. 
 You do, yes. 
 So that helps. 
 Yes, I'm sure it does. 
 You don't have a huge rack. 
 No, I don't unfortunately. 
 So that's not gonna work. 
 Nope. 
 Okay, here's what you do. Wait, how old is he? 
 Old. (CONTINUED) 62. 54 CONTINUED: (2) 54 
 Like really old? 
 Like parent old. 
 Nasty. Rock on, Jessica. 
 Thank you, Madison. 
 Alright, you have to hook him. Force his hand. Make him unable to stop himself from doing what he knows to be wrong. 
 How? 
 Do what I do. Send him a postcard from downtown. 
 Huh? 
 Go TMZ on his ass. 
 I'm not following you, Madis-- 
 The full gyno. 
 A crotch shot? A nip slip? (THEN) A dirty picture! You can even Annie Leibowitz it. Tasteful but with nipple. Yeah, that's what you should do: make it artistic. Black and white. Make this face. 
 Jesus, Madison! 
 Well, you came to me for advice, that's my advice. You put those across his radar, he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure. 
 Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though. He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site. And then your brother sees it, tells your mom, and suddenly you're not allowed to use Facebook for a month. Thanks, Kevin! 
 (DRAMATICALLY) There she is! 
 
 Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The Scarlet Letter: `No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.' 
 I am not bewildered! Jessica Riley is my soulmate. She's the one! I know it to be true, and so now do the multitude. (CORRECTING HIMSELF) Multitudes? (then, deciding) No, multitude. 
 Robbie, get down! 
 I have marked myself with this Scarlet J, Jessica! For you. Because your name starts with a J. It's just tape and construction paper but one day I will get a permanent tattoo when I'm old enough that my parents won't freak out on me. 
 Robbie Weaver! I am your baby- sitter and I'm telling you to GET YOUR ASS DOWN FROM THERE NOW! 
 
 (HEATED WHISPER) What the hell are you thinking? 
 You like the scaffold? It has wheels. Took four weeks to build it. (THEN) Oh, those are my friends, they helped me wheel it down. Wave hello. 
 This has to stop, Robbie. Seriously. 
 You'll learn to love me. I promise. 
 I won't. 
 Just because I'm four years younger than you? 
 BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!! 
 I've been spending time with him for a while. 
 No. You can't. I've checked. No boyfriend since ninth grade. No date for Spring Formal last 
 -- 
 He's older. I don't want my parents to know. 
 Who is he? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Do I know him? Is he from town? 
 I don't know. Yes, kind of. (CONTINUED) 66. 55 CONTINUED: (3) 55 
 I'll kill him if he hurts you. 
 I know. But this all has to stop now, Robbie. The speeches, the texts, all of it. It's very sweet, but it has to stop. 
 I'll see you around, okay? 
 ROBBIE'S FRIEND We should probably get the scaffold back on the road before dark. 
 Yeah. 
 (INTO PHONE) Hey, Nanna! I know, it's been forever. Have you been getting out at all? I'll bring you some of that deli you like one night, okay? The kids? They're fine. (to other room) Kids, say hi to Nanna. 
 So you're seeing Mom tomorrow, huh? At my parent-teacher thing? 
 First time in a while. 
 Nothing. It's just... there's this girl. 
 I like Pringles. This girl's my soulmate. I'm like crazy, stupid, in love with her. And she wants someone else. 
 Yeah. 
 Why not? (then, quietly) You did. 
 Mom was yours, right? 
 Listen, Dad. I love you. I have your back, always. But let's be honest here: the woman told you she wanted a divorce and you jumped out of a car. 
 You're the same guy. You just have different clothes. Do you still love her? 
 (STRONGLY) Do you still love Mom? 
 We are. Your son is in desperate need of some romantic inspiration. So set an example for your boy. Don't give up. It's complicated? Uncomplicate it. She says no? Change her mind. Look at you, you're the man right now, Dad. Get her back. (DRAMATICALLY) Get back my mom. 
 (O.S.) Wow. 
 (FLOORED) You look great, Cal. 
 Well you look great. Really. 
 Me, too. She sound okay to you? 
 Mrs. Thompson. This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on. 
 Yeah. (THEN) I kind of like him, though. 
 Me, too. 
 Oh... it's not. (THEN) It wasn't about him, if that means anything. 
 You seeing anyone? 
 Oh. Because you hear things, you know. 
 I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer. 
 CAL (CONT'D) (THEN) I shouldn't have jumped out of the car. I should have fought for you. You fight for your soulmate. At least that's what our thirteen- year-old tells me. 
 He's a very strange boy, isn't he? 
 I missed you, too. 
 (O.S.) Mr. and Mrs. Weaver? 
 
 Cal? What are you doing here? 
 You two know each other? 
 We've met before? Seriously? 
 Oh, so now she's your WIFE again? 
! 
 YES, WHY DON'T WE!? 
 I'm sorry, I'm playing catch-up: how do you two know each other? 
 Maybe your husband should tell you. 
 Ha! 
 Yes, let's do that. Let's focus on Robbie. 
 As you know, Robbie's shining moment this year was when he set a school record for cursing in an eighth grade English class. 
 Asshole. Are you familiar with this word, Mrs. Weaver? 
 Asshole: as in, someone who tells a woman that he'll call, and never does. 
 -- 
 Asshole: as in, someone who uses `honesty' to get a woman into bed with him, but is actually full of shit like the rest of them. 
 Asshole: as in, someone who allows a woman to go down on him for forty-five minutes because he's `nervous' -- 
 Leave me alone, Cal! 
 I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you 
! 
 
 (fumbling for keys) I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you. 
 I can't do this now, Cal. 
 Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute, 
! 
 I'm going home. 
 I!!! Tracy hesitates. Cal seizes the moment. 
 I don't even know who you are. 
 Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!? 
 Now, if we could get our guest of honor over here... I forget what she looks like, anyone remember? 
 I'm so proud of you, baby. I had my doubts, of course... 
 Now I did tell you that it'd be a special night when you passed the bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know I never lie... 
 So, Hannah, I'd like to formally ask you, in front of all our friends and colleagues... (CONTINUED) 78. 64 CONTINUED: 64 Hannah waits, frozen. 
 ... if you'd like to become a permanent lawyer at the firm of Watkins, Goldberg, and Schmidt!? 
 You don't have a better offer already, do you? 
 No, that's great. I just... (then, privately) I'm sorry, I thought... I thought you were about to propose. 
 What? 
 No, I just... it's fine. I'm sorry, I just got thrown is all. 
 Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize. 
 No, no, don't be silly, it's fine. 
 It's definitely a possibility, down the road. I think I just need a little more time. I'm still figuring out how I feel about us, you know: long-term. 
 No, I know... (THEN) Wait -- you're figuring out how you feel about us? She LAUGHS. Once. Then twice. Loudly. Everyone's now watching. Liz gets a good seat, excited. 
 Honey? 
 You know what the best part is: I would have said yes! To YOU! And I didn't even want you to propose! Just now, I swear to God: I was hoping you wouldn't propose. And I still would have said YES! That's how pathetic I am! 
 I will consider your job offer, thank you so much, Richard. 
 And you know what she said? 
 (O.S.) What? What did she say? 
 
. 
. 
 Do you remember me? 
 Yes. 
 Do you still think I'm attractive? 
 Yes. 
 Do you still want to take me home? 
 Yes. 
 Let's go. 
 #1 Slut. 
 This place looks like something out of a men's magazine. 
 Is that a compliment? 
 I'm not sure. 
 I like this song. 
 I thought you would. (THEN) Drink? 
 Yes, please. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 So is this how it normally works? 
 What? 
 How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink? 
 Yes. That's how it normally works. 
 And then you sleep with them? 
 Yes. 
 So that's what happens next? We sleep together? 
 At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan. 
 I'm very nervous. 
 I'm getting that. 
 I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic. 
 You're adorable. 
 No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here! (THEN) I'm here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me. 
 I don't think people say `bang' anymore. 
 I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! 
 Okay, okay, this is happening. (THEN) Take off your shirt. 
 What? 
 I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. 
 Holy crap. 
 It's like you're photo-shopped. 
 Now take off yours. 
 No way! Not with all that happening... 
 So... do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom? 
 (AMUSED) In the bedroom is preferable. 
 Good. Let's go there. 
 
 (TIPSY) This pillow is amazing. It forms perfectly to the shape of my head. 
 I'm glad you like it. 
 Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone? 
 They are, aren't they!? I always wondered who actually buys them! You do! The hot guy from the bar buys them! Of course! 
 Sorry, let's proceed. 
 You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you? 
 (LYING) No. 
 Oh. My. God! You totally do! 
 (ADMITTING) I do. 
 How much did it cost? 
 Five thousand doll-- 
 
 Do me a favor. Ask me a question about myself. 
 What? No! I don't want to know anything about you. 
 C'mon, one question. 
 Okay, fine, but then we bang. 
 Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll answer anything. You can ask me about my job, or past 
 -- 
 What's your mom like? 
 Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but cold. Very cold. 
 And your father? 
 He died, long time ago. Left us a lot of money, which is how I have... 
 Stuff like this. 
 And time for stuff like that? 
 My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually... 
 
. 
 I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I was wondering if -- 
 David, stop. Look, I had a nice time, which is a substantial upgrade from the rest of the... times I've been having lately. So, I don't think I'm ready to start dating but my ex clearly is and there's a yogurt shop where they make this eight calorie ice cream that tastes like a laxative, so if you'd like to take me there sometime I guess I wouldn't say no. 
 Wow. You know, that's exactly what I was thinking. It's almost uncanny. 
 Hello. 
 Oh, Jessica. Hi. Sorry. Jessica, this is my work-friend. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 89. 74 CONTINUED: 74 
 TRACY (CONT'D) He's an accountant named David. David, this is my baby-sitter, Jessica. Okay, David, well everything sounds great. Spreadsheets. 
 I'll see you at work. 
 So... How was dinner? 
 It was just for work. 
 (POINTEDLY) It's a pretty dress. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 So how much do I owe yo-- 
 Did you know your kids are the only ones I baby-sit for who always want to stay awake so they can see their dad when he gets home. I mean, they fight with everything they have to keep their eyes open so they can hear what Dad had for dinner, or how he liked the movie. Lot of kids want to stay awake for Mom -- and your kids always want to see you, don't get me wrong -- but not a lot wait up for Dad. Maybe it's because he's good, and he's kind, and he's decent. 
 What are you talking abo-- 
 Batshit crazy. 
 Jessica? 
 I DON'T WANT YOUR SLUTTY MONEY! 
 Jessica! 
 at top of the stairs, regarding the flowers. 
: 
 (O.S.) Kids! Ice cream! 
 Hi, Cal. 
 So... I'm in the basement. I'm trying to get the water heater working `cause the pilot's out and I don't know how to relight it. 
 I'm sorry to bother you, I just... what do I do? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, it's down. 
 I got it. 
 Oh, there it goes! 
 Well, thanks, Cal. I... appreciate your help. 
 (AWKWARD BEAT) Talk to you later? 
 Yeah. And... thanks again. 
 Sure. 
 She still won't talk to you? (CONTINUED) 94. 80 CONTINUED: 80 CAL Not if that show's on. 
 No, I mean, Mom. 
 What happened? 
! 
! 
 Oh, hey, Cal. 
 So how've you -- 
 Hey, Cal. 
 I'm sorry. I know I've been out of circulation. 
 I've been a little... things have gotten a bit... I met a woman. 
 No, I mean, I've been spending a lot of time with her. This woman. One woman. 
 Actually, tonight... I'm going to meet her mother. 
 Yes, I realize that, asshole. 
 Gotta go. Grab a beer next week? 
 Thanks. 
 No!!!! 
 
 
 Daddy? 
 
 Baby! What are you wearing!? 
 Dad's here. 
 I have to blindfold you. 
 (WEARY) What is this? What is he doing? 
 Relax, Mom. He's your husband, not Al Queda. You'll make it out alive. 
 Okay, we're good, let's do this. 
 Can I take these off, please? 
 (LAUNCHING IN) Twenty-five years ago, Cal Weaver saw Tracy Boyle for the first time, walking the halls of Woodside Middle School -- 
 Cal: are you seriously doing this in front of the kids? 
 (QUICKLY) If it goes bad I'm supposed to take Molly upstairs and put the TV on loud. 
 Well, might as well wait for your daughter. 
 No, your other daughter. 
 (O.S.) Hello? 
. 
 Hi, Daddy. 
 Cal? 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Wait, you two know each other? 
 (STILL BLIND) Hi, Nanna. 
 Hey, Nanna. 
 Hey, Robbie. 
 Hey, cutie. 
 WHAT THE HELL IS A NANNA!? 
 It's me, I couldn't pronounce Hannah when I was little -- wait, so how do you know my dad? 
 (REALIZING) Oh, God. 
 Dad, this is my boyfriend, Jacob. 
 I want to see the boyfriend! (STRUGGLING WITH 
) Can someone please take this off? 
 HOW THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A 24-YEAR- 
!? 
 WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT? 
! 
 So you two, like, really know each other? 
 Daddy!!! 
 Well, that's not going to happen. CAL Well, then I'm going to murder you. 
 
! 
 (down to two scarves) Will someone please take this goddamn thing off me! 
 Daddy, no! 
 Is that Jessica? 
 Daddy! 
 Daddy! 
 (YANKING ON 
) What's happening? 
 I LET HER BABY-SIT FOR YOU, YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH! SHE'S 
! 
 Jacob! 
 Daddy, stop! 
 He didn't do anything. He doesn't even know. 
 Know what? 
 (STILL BLINDFOLDED) Robbie, please get this off me! 
 (struggling with it) I'm TRYING! 
 He doesn't even know that I'm in love with him! 
 With who? 
 (pointing at Cal) With him. 
 Are you pointing at him? 
 Who is she pointing at!? 
 
 (PROCESSING) Wait: my dad is the older guy you've been seeing? 
 I knew it. 
 (TO BERNIE) He doesn't even know about the dirty pictures I made for him. 
 You made him dirty pictures? Oh God. 
 (TO CAL) You're the one? You're the one she... (then, furious) You stole my soulmate. 
 (O.S.) I'm sorry, is Tracy home? 
 You left your sweater in my car the other night. 
 Who are you? 
 David Jacobowitz. 
 David Jacobowitz! 
 Is this a bad time -- 
 Jacob! 
 You know how much misery you've put this poor bastard through!? 
 #1 Well, okay. That should about do it. (to his partner) What do you think? 
 #1 Look, I'm just gonna write domestic disturbance reported but all clear, okay? `Cause honestly, I don't even know what to put down here. 
 Thank you, Officer. 
 #1 Just... simmer down, okay? We all have arguments, but if you're gonna fight -- just do it inside. Keep it in the family, okay? 
 Let's go. Now. 
 I'm so sorry -- 
 NOW! 
 CAL -- 
 -- 
 (under her breath) Oh, that's ironic. 
 Dad, c'mon, I'm not going to stop seeing him. 
 
 -- 
 
 Cal, stop being unreasona-- 
! 
 IT'S NOT YOUR HOUSE ANYMORE, CAL! 
 (one last try) Cal, c'mon -- 
 
 (THROUGH TEARS) Goodbye, cutie. 
 (WOUNDED) Nice. 
 Go home, Dad. 
 Can I get you another? 
 2:30. In the afternoon. 
 (O.S.) Ah, it's okay, I deserved it. 
 
 It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal. 
 Can I sit? 
 Okay, are we going to be mature about this, or act like children? 
 Okay, so like children then. Move over. 
 I'd like to talk. 
 Yes. 
 Cal. (THEN) Cal, look at me. 
 You been hanging out here a lot? 
 Must be missing a lot of work. 
 Some vacation. 
 You want a sip? 
 Your kids miss you. 
 His eighth grade graduation is next week. You coming? 
 Well you haven't exactly been around for him, Cal. 
 Oh, that's a good excuse -- 
 I love her, Cal. 
 I've never been in love before. Honestly, I've never even been in `like' before. (THEN) I never got it. I saw people in love -- I saw weakness. I heard them say the things they said, and do the things they do, it all just seemed so... so pathetic. (THEN) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 113. 102 CONTINUED: (3) 102 
 JACOB (CONT'D) She's my perfect combination of everything, Cal. 
 I'll see you at graduation. 
 
 (V.O.) ... and now, to introduce the first student speaker: our very own English teacher Kate Thompson! 
 Our next speaker is not only the class salutatorian, but he's also one of the most... (SEARCHING) Spirited... young men, I've ever had the pleasure of teaching. Ladies and gentlemen: Robbie Weaver. 
 (a bit monotone) Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. Welcome, Class of 2011. 
 (A) I wasn't really sure what I wanted to talk about today. Mrs. Thompson said it might be good to talk about growing up and getting older and stuff. So I guess I'll talk about that. 
 I grew up a lot this year, I think. I used to think that growing up meant really growing. Like getting taller and bigger. But now I think that growing up just makes you smaller. Your dreams get smaller, and what you want gets smaller... (beat, then) I grew an inch and a half this year, but I feel a lot smaller. 
 I was in love. And I know that makes parents laugh because I'm only thirteen but whatever, I was. (MORE) 
 ROBBIE (CONT'D) I believed that there was one true love for everyone, and if you fought for that person, your one true love would always work out. But that's not how it works. It sounded good when I was younger, but... it's just not how it works. There's no such thing as one true love for everyo-- 
 Dad? 
 
 (HEATED WHISPER) What are you doing? 
 I was wrong, Dad. There's no such thing as -- 
 CAL (CONT'D) I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. And I have loved her with everything I have for every minute, of every day, ever since she let me buy her that first mint chip ice cream. I have loved her through the birth of our three perfect children, and I have loved her even as I've hated her -- only married couples can truly understand that one. And I don't know what will wind up happening with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm sorry I can't give you that -- but I promise you this: I will never stop trying. When you find `the one' you never give up trying... and I love you, my amazing boy, for reminding me of that. 
 I still love you, Jessica! I've loved you since the first time you changed my sister's diaper! I've loved you since... 
 Daddy. 
 Cal, I'm not going to -- 
 Hannah took me to the Gap. It's actually not as bad as I thought. 
 Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap. I got this at Nordstrom's. 
 It was nice of you to come. 
 I wouldn't have missed it. 
 So, how are things with your dad? 
 Strained. I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna head up there early. Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while. 
 Yeah, probably a good idea. (THEN) You were a good baby-sitter, Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. 
 Wait: I thought you weren't giving up. 
 I'm not. But I figure: you like my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you then. 
 It's a good plan. 
 Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school. 
 You take care, Robbie. 
 
 (RE: ENVELOPE) I am now, Dad. I am now. 
 (O.S.) I'm terrified of what's going to become of him once he hits puberty. 
 You gave a good eighth grade graduation speech. 
 Do you think we can ever come back from all this, Cal? 
 Things are just so messed up. And it's been such a strange year. I've been in such a strange place. And we have all these problems, so many problems I've lost count, but at the end of the day, I mean, the only thing I know -- 
 I am just so glad you took me for that ice cream.

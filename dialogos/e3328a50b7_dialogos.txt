 (V.O.) (through bullhorn) McMurphy! This is Doctor Shankle, from the infirmary. Can you hear me? 
 (V.O.) (through bullhorn) Can you hear me, McMurphy? 
 (through bullhorn) Why don't we blast 'im, for Christ sake, he ain't gonna come down... you... 
 (V.O.) (through bullhorn) McMurphy! I have the warden's promise. If you come down, nobody will hurt you! You'll be in my custody! I promise! 
 Where you goin', Chief? 
 You goin' t'see the Big White Fathuh? 
 He goin' t'see the Big White Muthuh... 
 WASHINGTON (CONT'D) Haw, look at 'im, big 'nough to eat apples off my head an' he mine me like a baby... 
 (simultaneously, as Big Nurse passes) Mornin', Miss Ratched... 
 Good morning, boys. 
 Good morning, Miss Ratched. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? 
 Mean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean old Monday... (she flips on the intercom) Good morning, boys. Rise and shine. Rise and shine. 
 (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Time to get up! Come on now, it's a beautiful day! Let's not straggle! Everybody up, up, up! 
 Good morning, Mister Sefelt... Good morning, Mister Fredrickson. Good morning, Billy, I spoke to your mother last night and she sends her love... Good morning, Mister Harding... Good morning, Mister Cheswick. Mister Scanlon... 
 Yes, Miss Ratched? 
 Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance. 
 (taking Bromden by the hand) Yes, Miss Ratched... 
 (calling as he goes) Warren! 
 WASHINGTON (CONT'D) (shouting out) Get your black ass in here! 
 Tha's it... be right back! 
 
 Eighty-two, Miss Pilbow speaking... Yes... (she makes a note and hangs it) ... New admission, Miss Ratched... 
 (to an unseen occupant) Okay, let's go. 
 Okay, this is it! 
 Yeah, ain't that the truth. 
 (to Miss Pilbow) He's all yours, Miss. 
 Thank you, Officer... 
 So long, fellas... 
 MCMURPHY (CONT'D) Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day... 
 This way, Mister McMurphy. 
 Yes, ma'am... 
 (as he peels the Band-Aid off, revealing a scar) I tell ya, these goons showered me at the courthouse this morning, last night at the jail, and I swear they'd have swabbed my ears out on the way over if they could've found the facilities... 
 MCMURPHY (CONT'D) (to Nurse Itsu) Hey, how ya doin', cutie? 
 Okay. How you doing? 
 Just great! (calling after her) See ya around! 
 MCMURPHY (CONT'D) (to Nurse Pilbow) Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here. 
 I'm sure you will. 
 (to Nurse Pilbow) Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before. 
 Oh... 
 Yeah, I'm here on a ninety-day observation period. Short-timer, like they say... 
 Of course. (indicating door) Mister McMurphy. 
 After you, ma'am. 
 Thank you. 
 (to Washington and Warren as they step into ward) Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here. 
 (calling) Hold it! 
 SPIVEY (CONT'D) Good morning, boys. 
 Great day for fishing. 
 (O.S.) Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing, Doc... 
 (to McMurphy) Oh, what's that? 
 Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute. 
 Oh, do you do much fishing? 
 Fish! Hell, Doc, I'd like to have a nickel for every fish I landed between Point Conception and the Alaska coast... 
 (to McMurphy) Is that so? 
 Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight. 
 My, my... Ah, who are you? 
 McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy. 
 Mister McMurphy is a new admission. 
 Ah, yes. Well, we must talk soon, Mister McMurphy. 
 You bet, Doc. 
 Good morning, Jim. How are you feeling? 
 (approaching and pointing to his mouth) Doc, my gungs hurt me. 
 This way, Mister McMurphy. 
 (O.S.) Have you been taking your Dilantin, Jim? 
 (O.S.) Uh-huh... 
 (O.S.) Well, we'll send you over to the dentist and see what he can do. Okay? 
 (O.S.) Okay, Doc! 
 Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy... 
 Thank you, ma'am, 
 MCMURPHY (CONT'D) Hi. 
 Hi. 
 
 How ya doin', buddy? 
 Poorly, thank you. 
 Oh, yeah? What's ailing ya? 
 I got the fever. 
 Well, that's too bad... 
 MCMURPHY (CONT'D) Yeah, buddy? 
 Are you a doctor? 
 No, 'fraid not... 
 MCMURPHY (CONT'D) Yeah, buddy? 
 Can you borrow me a dime? 
 Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change... 
 Got a cigarette? 
 Sure... 
 Me too! Me too! 
 Hey, how's it look up there, big boy? 
 He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian! 
 That right? 
 HARDING (O.S.) (CONT'D) Martini! 
 (to Martini) Your buddy is callin' ya. 
 What's troubling ya, buddy? 
 I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me. 
 You look pretty healthy to me. 
 TABER (CONT'D) I'm the next one. 
 How do ya know that? 
 TABER (CONT'D) Because I quit breathing. 
 You're breathin' right now. 
 (crossing to him) What's that, Pop? 
 (leaning in close) Can't hear ya, old-timer. 
 Ain't this a pisser? 
 Hell, compared to where I just come from, this is a country club. 
 Whatcha boys playin'? 
 Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand. 
 What's your name, buddy? 
 Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy. 
 What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here? 
 Yeah, that'll do for openers! 
 Yeah, do you have an appointment? 
 What for? 
 (to Harding) What for? 
 (to McMurphy) He's a busy man! 
 I can wait... 
 I'm seeing what a busy man does. 
 HARDING (CONT'D) Martini, throw a card! 
 HARDING (CONT'D) No, throw a club! 
 Yeah, throw a club! 
 No! 
 No! 
 Yessir, that's why I came to this establishment for, to bring you birds fun and entertainment 'round the gamin' table... 
 Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us... 
 (O.S.) Mister McMurphy! 
 Yes, ma'am... 
 (rising) Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas! 
 My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients. 
 Thank you, ma'am... 
 This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet. 
 Yes, ma'am... 
 Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us. 
 Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me. 
 All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented. 
 Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am. 
 Good. I'm sure we'll be friends. 
 Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse. 
 Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along. 
 Yes, ma'am. (to Washington) Lead the way, Sam. 
 (V.O.) What other work have you done? 
 Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was. 
 Oh, what was that? 
 Poker! 
 I see. 
 Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man. 
 SPIVEY (CONT'D) In what way? 
 They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal. 
 I see... 
 To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure... 
 Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here? 
 Well, ya know, Doc... (indicating his papers) Doesn't it say so there? 
 (looking over papers) Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.' (looking up at McMurphy) What do you think of that report? 
 I don't, Doc... 
 (goes back to papers) Arrested on an assault charge five times... 
 That's correct, Doc ... 
 (reading from folder) The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that? 
 Doc, what can I tell ya? 
 Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy? 
 No, this is my first trip, Doc. 
 (closes folder and sits back) Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation! 
 You bet, Doc! 
 Good. Good. 
 I'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm awful tired... 
 (busy with her papers) Somebody please see to Mister Bancini, so we can start the meeting. 
 Awful tired... 
 At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife... (reading from logbook) Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding? 
 (reading) He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.' (she closes book) So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further? 
 Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water... 
 Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start? (no response) Billy. 
 Would you like to start? 
 Mister Sefelt? 
 No! 
 Mister Scanlon? 
 But you have no proof. 
 And yet you suspect her. 
 Why? 
 Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements? 
 What's he talkin' about? 
 Yeah, Harding, why don't you knockoff the bullshit and get to the point. 
 Yes, Billy? 
 Yeah, Harding, you're so fuckin' dumb I can't believe it. 
 Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway? 
 Through the ass. 
 (innocence itself) Now what would I be trying to say? 
 Peculiar? 
 Why? 
 Yeah, why? 
 Yeah, tell us why. 
 No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open... 
 HARDING (CONT'D) (his voice rising as he goes on) ... or making me aware of a condition in my life, then I say, categorically speaking, the hell with you, Taber! I don't have to justify the condition of my life to you or any of you. No matter what I will carry on until I fully understand what that function is regardless of the form or content. Regardless of the fact we must try to understand the function of our capacity to obtain, to personify the condition, the condition of our existence, our existence... 
 You know what, Harding? I think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something. You've been talking about your wife evere since I can remember. You know, she's on your mind and blah, blah, blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose! 
 Yeah, wise up, Harding. 
 Yeah, turn her loose! 
 (start pouring it on) Yeah, who do you think you are anyway?... He thinks he's God Almighty... He's a snob... He's a schmuck... Dumbbell... Creep... Cretin... Idiot... Get rid of him... Ship him upstairs... 
 (chiming in) Ffffffuck da wife... 
 (wagging his head) Tired... Awful tired... 
 (not letting up) Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut his nuts off... He doesn't have any... Fag... Pervert. 
 (in a strong angry voice) I'm tired! 
 Somebody see to Mister Bancini. 
 Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired... 
 You a good boy, Mistah Bancini... 
 You see... it's a lotta baloney... It's all a lotta baloney... 
 Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if you'll just be calm... 
 That's all it is, just a lotta baloney. Ya see, I can't help it, can't... 
 (working her way around Bancini) Yes, I know, I know... 
 ... don't ya see. I was born dead. Not you. You wasn't born dead. Ahhh, it's been so hard... (starts going over, slowly; sighing and crying) Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful tired... 
 (as he throws ball) Catch it! Catch it! 
 Martini, there ain't nobody there, ya dumb goon! Go get the ball! 
 No! 
 MARTINI (CONT'D) I get it! I get it! 
 Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party? 
 That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck? 
 Ah, come off it! It's that Big Nurse, that's who... 
 I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you! 
 Did to you and all the rest of you guys. 
 What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore. 
 It's the questions she asks. 
 Tell 'er to go straight to hell! 
 (as calm as blue waters) She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy. 
 She's peckin' at your balls, buddy, at your ever-lovin' balls. 
 That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend. 
 P.A. What the hell is that? 
 Potential assaultive. 
 Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job. 
 Huh? 
 Tell 'er to go to hell anyway! 
 HARDING (CONT'D) And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery. 
 What for? 
 HARDING (CONT'D) Lobotomy! 
 Lobotomy? 
 HARDING (CONT'D) (pointing to lobotomy case) That! 
 (to Harding) Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'? 
 Gimme the ball! 
 No. Me! Me! 
 (O.S.) Pass the ball, McMurphy. 
 (turning to Martini) Pass it to me, Martini. 
 C'mon, I'll give it back! 
 Atta boy, Martini. 
 (encouraging them) Back and forth, that's it. Shoot, man, we'll be takin' on the New York Knicks before we're through... 
 (V.O) Hey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on, I'm waitin' on you suckers, you hit or you sit... 
 Hit me! 
 Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load. 
 Boogered! 
 'Kay, place your bets. 
 (holding up a cigarette) What's this? 
 That's a dime, Martini. 
 MARTINI (CONT'D) Bet a nickel! 
 (to Cheswick) Whadaya bet, Cheswick? 
 She won't give me any more cigarettes! 
 That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want? 
 CHESWICK (CONT'D) Lend me twenty. 
 (checking the board) 'Kay, all bets are down, let's wheel 'em an' deal 'em. 
 Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini? 
 Hit me. 
 (hits with a picture) That's twenty up, Martini. (turning to TV, he shouts across room) Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game? 
 MARTINI (CONT'D) Hit me! 
 Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing. (turning back to Taber) What? 
 (shouting back) Koufax against Ford! 
 (V.O.) (over loudspeaker) Medication time! Medication time! Medication! 
 (simultaneously with Pilbow) Hit me! 
 Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning... 
 (scared out of her wits) Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back! 
 All I'm askin' is... 
 Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here. 
 Sorry, ma'am. 
 (to Big Nurse) Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'? 
 (politely) Yes, Mister McMurphy? 
 How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think? 
 (pleasantly) That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy. 
 (confidentially) Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout! 
 Sorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that... 
 Sorry to have bothered you. 
 Not at all, Mister McMurphy... 
 Your medicine, Mister McMurphy. 
 (turning back, he examines the contents of the cup) What's the horse pill for, honey? 
 It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes... 
 Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is! 
 (stepping back a little) Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy... 
 I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus... 
 That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may... 
 No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes. 
 Yeah, whattsa matter, Mack, she too much for ya? 
 You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh? 
 Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me! 
 HARDING (CONT'D) She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady. 
 PATIENTS' POV 
 
. 
 (V.O.) (through intercom) Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card? 
 (V.O.) (through intercom) Me. Hit me! 
 Le's get back to bed, Mistah Bromden... 
 (whispering) Chief? I wanna ask ya somethin'. (sings) Oh, does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? When you chew it in the morning, will it be too hard to bite? This question's got me goin', won't somebody set me right; does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? 
 Here ya go, Chief... 
 (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Good morning, boys. Rise and shine. Rise and shine. 
 (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Time to got up! Come on now, it's a beautiful day! Let's not straggle! Everybody up, up, up! 
 Le's go, Chief. Le's go get ourselves all nice and clean... (to McMurphy) You too, Mistah Mack-Murphy! 
 (looking in the drawer) What the... (looking around) Who the fuck stole my cigarettes! 
 Good morning, Mister Sefelt, are your teeth any better?... Good morning, Mister Fredrickson... Good morning, Mister Harding; my, my, you've been biting your fingernails again... 
 I wanna report a robbery! 
 On this ward? 
 Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes! 
 Oh, I had them removed. 
 What for? 
 Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day. 
 Yes, Miss Ratched? 
 Please see to Mister Bromden. 
 (taking Bromden by the hand) Yes, Miss Ratched... 
 Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast... (to McMurphy) You too, Mister McMurphy. 
 Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose? 
 After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast. 
 You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya! 
 Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly. 
 
 'Kay, let's go brush our teeth, fellas... 
 Oh, Lulu had a baby, His name was Sunny Jim, She put 'im in a piss pot, To teach 'im how to swim. Oh, he swam to the bottom, He swam to the top, Lulu got excited, An' pulled 'im by his... Cock-tail ginger-ale, Five cents a glass, An' if ya don't like it Ya can shove it up your... Ask me no more questions, I'll tell ya no more lies. 
 
 (O.S.) What's wrong with you guys? 
 Why, if I'd have known how soft this place was gonna be, I'd have arranged for my transfer sooner... (holding up his orange juice) Look at this here, real orange juice! (slugging it down) Hooee, that's good. Why, you couldn't pay me to leave this place! (slaps his belly) All this place lacks is a couple of sweet gals to liven things up... 
 Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'. 
 Nobody leaves here till seven thirty. 
 Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam. 
 WASHINGTON (CONT'D) Tha's your problem. 
 (confidentially) Who do you like in the opening game, Sam? 
 WASHINGTON (CONT'D) Huh? 
 (turning away) Asshole. 
 (V.O.) I wanna know about my cigarettes! 
 Sit down, Mister Cheswick. 
 (not sitting) No, I ain't no kid to have my cigarettes keep from me like cookies! Ain't that right, Mack! (McMurphy doesn't respond) Mack??? 
 Sit down, Mister Cheswick! 
 Yeah... 
 Good... (opens her book) Now, as I recall, we were making quite a bit of headway, last time, with Mister Harding's problem. So, does anyone care to begin? 
 Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem. 
 Certainly, Mister McMurphy. 
 Right! 
 'Kay... Item one... I've been thinkin' 'bout the age problem we got on this ward. You know, the young an' old livin' together, an' I was thinkin' what a great thing it would be if the music was turned up louder. Louder so the old fellas could hear better... 
 But then I got to thinkin', the music is so loud already, it makes it difficult for the young fellas to hold a decent conversation... 
 Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc? 
 It is worth considering... Miss Ratched? 
 The point is well taken, Doctor, but do we have the necessary personnel to cover a second day room? 
 Well, since it will be largely the Chronics who remain here, one aide and one nurse should easily be able to handle any situation that might occur. (he turns to the patients) What do you think, men, is it workable? 
 Right, Doc. It's workable. 
 Fine! 
 Good. Good. Yes, yes, I think we should give it a trial period. So! May we get back to Mister Harding's problem... (she sees McMurphy's hand up) Yes, Mister McMurphy? 
 I'm not finished yet. 
 Go on... 
 (looking at his list) 'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame. 
 Just a minute, Mister McMurphy! 
 Yeah? 
 Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines. 
 The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now! 
 I second the motion! 
 Atta boy, Cheswick! 
 Very well! All those in favor, please raise your hands. 
 (raising his hand) Okay, raise your hands. 
 Come on', what is this crap? Who wants to watch the World Series? 
 No way. 
 No way. 
 (checking her watch) Then I suggest we turn our attention back to Mister Harding's problem. Would anybody care to begin? 
 HARDING (CONT'D) To reflect... 
 
 (V.O.) Hold it a minute. What's a man need to buy thum hotels? 
 You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes. 
 Hold it a minute. 
 Let's go, for Christsakes... 
 It's your dirty roll, Cheswick. 
 Snake eyes! Hoooeee, that puts you on my Marvin Gardens, which means you owe me three hundred and fifty dollars. 
 What's thum other things? Hold it a minute. What's thum other things all over the board? 
 (to Martini) How can a man concentrate with you sitting there hallucinating a mile a minute... 
 You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon. 
 Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go... (throws the dice) Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini... 
 SCANLON (CONT'D) Not that one, you crazy bastard, that's my house... 
 Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody. 
 What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote! 
 It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will! 
 Right! 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah! 
 Big man! 
 Yeah, how much you wanna bet? 
 On what? 
 That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery! 
 That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do. 
 Maybe he'll just show Miss Ratched his big thing an' she'll open the door for him. 
 Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt. 
 SEFELT (CONT'D) Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy. 
 You think it's funny, huh? 
 Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place! 
 Put your money where your mouth is, Taber. 
 TABER (CONT'D) Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy! 
 (rising and turning on the others, who back off) You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how! 
 TABER (CONT'D) Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how! 
 All right! 
 With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how! 
 You're fuckin' A-right, I am! 
 HARDING (CONT'D) With your own two hands? 
 You heard me the first time! 
 I'll bet a buck you don't do it! 
 You're on! 
 Stand aside, son. Any more takers? 
 I'll bet a dollar. 
 Me, too... 
 Right! 
 A nickel. 
 A dime. 
 Okay. Who else? 
 (knows he's taking a bad bet) Okay, Harding, you're on. 
 Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen! 
 Just warmin' up. 
 But I tried. Goddammit, I sure as hell did that much. Didn't I? 
 That's okay, kid... 
 No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off. 
 What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay! 
 WASHINGTON'S POV Way down the hall, the Group Meeting is SEEN in progress. 
 Try, Billy, try... 
 Tell us about it... 
 What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy? 
 Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love? 
 Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business. 
 Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy. 
 Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also! 
 Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much? 
 What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it! 
 Yeah, let's vote on it! 
 Will one more vote satisfy you? 
 Yeah, it'll satisfy me. 
 Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy? 
 I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame! 
 (to the patients) A vote is before the group. 
 Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts. 
 Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand. 
 That's it! We made it! 
 I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight. 
 So do I! 
 But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy. 
 (the light dawning) You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there? 
 I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy. 
 Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch... 
 (losing ground) You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy! 
 Well, screw that noise! 
 Sit down, Mister McMurphy! 
 Hoo-wee! Man, all I need me now is a can of beer and a red-hot. 
 Sit down, Mister Cheswick. 
 Mack... 
 (V.O.) (over loudspeaker) I want you men to return to your proper places. The group meeting is not over! 
 (jumping up and shouting at the blank TV screen) A hit! It's a hit! He's rounding first, heading for second. Here comes the throw. He's sliding... and... he's safe! He's safe! (McMurphy whistles and claps his hands) Hoo-wee! Whatta game! Whatta game! Come on, Koufax! Strike 'em out! 
 (V.O.) (over loudspeaker) Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!... 
 He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner! 
 (V.O.) (over loudspeaker) You men remain seated! 
 (focusing in on TV screen) He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit! 
 (jumping up and down) I saw thum! I saw thum! 
 Me, too! Me, too! 
 Yes, I see it! I see it! 
 (on his feet, shouting) Ya-hoo, let's'play ball! 
 Ya-hoo! It's a hit! A triple! It's a home run! A double! He's out! Whadaya blind? He's safe by a mile! 
 (AD LIB) 
 (V.O.) (over loudspeaker) You boys, stop this and go to your assignments! Mister McMurphy, I want you to set an example... 
 'Kay, it's two outs, bases loaded as Koufax steps up to the mound... Checks the runners... goes into his wind-up... Here comes the three-two pitch... And it's a fly ball into deep center. Mantle is going back. He's going back! Back! His back is up against the wall... and... he catches it! He catches it! 
 How are you feeling? 
 Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here. 
 Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward? 
 Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin. 
 Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients. 
 Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all. 
 Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case. 
 Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'. 
 I'm afraid not. 
 Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she! 
 No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton. 
 Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me. 
 I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here. 
 When? 
 We'll let you know. 
 (with great physical and vocal emphasis throughout entire scene) Okay, Chief. This is your spot! I don't want you to move from this spot! Never!... 'Kay, now, take the ball! Raise your hands, like this... 
 That's good! That's a good boy, Chief! Now jump and put it in! 
 I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that! 
 I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think! 
 Well, it doesn't hurt him either! (turning to Bromden) Does it, Chief! (no response) See, it doesn't hurt him. (to Bromden) Jump! An' put it in! 
 Ha! Did ya see that! (calling to Cheswick on the sidelines) Hey, Cheswick! 
 Yeah, Mack? 
 Come here! 
 Yeah, Mack? 
 Let me get on your shoulders. 
 Sure, Mack... 
 'Kay, wheel me around to the basket... 'Kay, easy, easy. Hold it! 'Kay, now. (he sees Bromden has walked away) Hey, Chief, come back! 
 Cheswick, go get 'im! 
 Now, wheel me to the basket. 
 (pointing to the floor) Wait here, Chief. (more to himself as he starts down hall) Heh, heh, I'll show 'em who's crazy. 
 Hey, Cheswick! Wake up! 
 (waking up) Yeah, Mack, what is it? 
 I'm leaving. Goodbye! 
 (sitting up) Where ya goin', Mac? 
 Shhh... 
 (waking Billy) Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy. 
 So long, kid. 
 Shhh... 
 (nudging Martini awake) Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up! 
 (waking up) Yeah, Mac? 
 Bye-bye. 
 Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up! 
 (waking up) Yeah, what's up? 
 Shhhh. See ya around the ball park. 
 (waking up) What? What? 
 So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles. 
 (sitting up) What? 
 Shhh... 
 Bye-bye, pussy cat. 
 (waking Taber) Up an' at 'em, Taber. 
 (waking up) What's going on? 
 Shhhh. Time to say goodbye. 
 Hey, Hard-on. Wake up, Dumbo. 
 MCMURPHY (CONT'D) Ya owe me twenty-five bucks. 
 I'm busting outta this place. 
 (turning to the others who have gathered around) So long suckers. 
 How ya gettin' out, Mac? 
 Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out. 
 Bullshit. You ain't got no way out! 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah! 
 How much ya wanna bet? 
 TABER (CONT'D) Ten bucks. 
 You're on. (to the others) Let's go! An' keep it quiet. 
 Where's it go? 
 Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it. 
 I don't believe it... 
 Neither do I... 
 Me too... 
 I wanna see it... 
 Me too! Me too! 
 Yeah, show us, Mac! 
 Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened. 
 No! I wanna go! 
 Me too! Me too! 
 Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay? 
 (simultaneously) 'Kay, Mac! 
 Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay? 
 (simultaneously) 'Kay, Mac! 
 'Kay, let's see... (he checks the men out) Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay 
 (simultaneously) 'Kay! 
 Shhh! 
 (looking around) Where's Martini and Scanlon? 
 (pointing) They went that way. 
 Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand! 
 Right, Mack! 
 There they are! 
 Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here! (starting after them) Come on, let's get 'em! 
 (calling back) Come on, you guys, let's stick together. 
 Somebody's coming! 
 Shhh! (he listens then) This way! 
 Yeah, my feet are gettin' cold. 
 Mine, too! 
 We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay? 
 (simultaneously) 'Kay, Mack! 
 They must be up there! 
 Yeah! 
 Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there! 
 Fuck Miss Ratched! 
 (O.S.) Wow! Look at this! 
 (O.S.) Hey, you guys, come on up here and take a gander at this! 
 There they are! 
 (his attention elsewhere) Hey, what's that? 
 (simultaneously) What? Where? 
 (pointing) Over there! 
 (squinting) I don't know... 
 A bus? 
 Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place. 
 We'll get in trouble... 
 Yeah, maybe we ought to go back, Mac... 
 Yeah, my feet are cold... 
 My feet hurt... 
 (walking towards the bus) Go ahead! Go back! 
 Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac. 
 I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside. 
 (shouting to them) Get on assholes! 
 (waving Bromden onto the bus) Come on, Chief! Let's go! 
 46 
 (singing) Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee... 
 Yeah, kid? 
 Yeah, where we going? 
 I dunno. Where do ya wanna go? 
 I wanna go home! 
 Yeah, it's cold! 
 I'm hungry. 
 Yeah, we'll miss breakfast! 
 Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay? 
 (singing) Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand... 
 (as he steps out of the bus) This is it! 
 INSERT - KEYBOARD 
 Come on in an' warm up. You can put some of that gear on to keep warm. An' there's beer an' Coke in the cooler an' some food over here... 
 Come on, don't be shy now, you're among friends. 
 Why don't one of you boys help ol' Chief there get warmed up? 
 When do you think we'll be going back, Mack? 
 (looking out the window) Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'. 
 Oh, look at the pretty boat. 
 ACUTES' POV 
 (V.O.) Yeah, did you ever see a boat like that? Why, I'll bet you could go all the way to Hawaii in that boat! Tahiti... the Philippines... Tibet... 
 Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella. 
 My turn. 
 (hanging onto the pole) No. 
 Up, I told you! Keep that tip up... up! You had you one big silver there. 
 (O.S.) Oh, my God! I see something! 
 Jesus God... 
 What is it? 
 We'll never get that on the boat. 
 What is it, kid? 
 He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch. 
 Does that mean we have to cut him loose? 
 Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope. 
 Me, too. 
 Me, too. 
 Steady does it, Sefelt! 
 SEFELT'S POV 
 (over bull horn) All right! Stand to! Stand to! 
 (to Big Nurse) Here they are, Miss Ratched. Safe and sound! 
 Good. Well, boys, did you enjoy yourselves? 
 (to Sefelt) Show her the one you caught, Jim. 
 My, my... 
 Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two. 
 Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you! 
 (loudly) Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it! 
 No, it was irresponsible! 
 (crossing to McMurphy) Gimme a cigarette! 
 I thought I might donate it to the mess hall. 
 (reaches in his pocket; he has none) I don't have any. 
 (to Harding) Gimme a cigarette! 
 Why not? 
 (holding his hands up; empty) All gone! All gone! Don't hit! Don't hit! 
 I'm sure sorry, ma'am. Gawd, but I am. That window glass was so clean I didn't even see it... 
 You guys want cigarettes! Here's the goddamn cigarettes! 
 Warren! Miller! 
 (pointing to a bench) Wait over there... 
 AIDE (CONT'D) (approaching him very gently) Come on, Joey... this isn't going to hurt you... good for you... make you feel better... 
 
 Thank you. 
 Say it again. 
 Thank you. 
 Say... God Bless America! 
 God Bless America. 
 (slapping his thigh) Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know? 
 No. 
 Shit! This is too much! (his mind going a mile a minute) Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em. 
 Ca-na-da... 
 Ya like that, Chief, huh? 
 Yeah... 
 Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor... 
 Ca-na-da... 
 Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an' me. Do ya understand? 
 (O.S.) Mister McMurphy. 
 (recognizing a long-lost friend) Hey, how ya doin'? 
 Fine, thank you. (offering pills) Here, please take these. 
 What are they? 
 To help you relax... please... 
 (rising, thumbs up) You an' me, Chief. 
 (to Itsu) You know, I never got your name. 
 (stopping at the door) Miss Itsu. (indicating the room) In here, please. 
 You comin' in to hold my hand? 
 No... 
 Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu. 
 Yeah... 
 (as he enters) Hi... 
 You boys can take a cigarette break now... 
 That's all right, Mister McMurphy, just climb on the bed and lie down... 
 Whatever you say, Doc... 
 (to McMurphy) This won't hurt you at all... 
 Uh, uh... 
 What's that for? 
 Conductant. 
 (smiling up at her) Surely, goodness and mercy will follow this, eh, honey? 
 (holding a mouthpiece) Please, put this in your mouth... 
 (to Sefelt) It's been brought to my attention that you're giving Mister Fredrickson your medication, aren't you, Mister Sefelt? 
 It's the Dilantin that makes my gums soft! 
 Now, Jim, you must be honest with yourself. 
 I wanna know why the dorm has to be locked in the daytime and on weekends? 
 Yeah, why can't a fellow even have the weekends to himself? 
 (standing up) Yeah, whadabout our cigarettes? 
 Sit down, Mister Cheswick, and wait your turn! 
 So what? Is it a mortal sin? I mean, normal people get to sleep late on weekends... 
 With few exceptions, time spent in the company of others is therapeutic, while every minute spent brooding alone only increases separation. 
 (jumping up as he sees McMurphy) Mack! 
 I got ten thousand watts and hot to trot. First woman takes me on is gonna light up like a pinball machine an' pay off in silver dollars... 
 Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points... 
 Mister McMurphy. 
 (turning) Yes, ma'am? 
 Welcome back. 
 Thank you, ma'am. 
 I hope everything is settled. 
 Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc! 
 Good. Why don't you join us? 
 Why, thank you, ma'am... (he gets a seat and sits heavily) Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else! (pulling it together) Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game? (no response) I figured as much... 
 Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan... 
 (coming out of it) Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah... 
 (wrapping it up) Thank you, boys. 
 Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland. 
 Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure. 
 Thank you, ma'am... 
 Gotta go now, ma'am... 
 Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy. 
 Thank you, ma'am. 
 
 (to Washington) Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose. 
 Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'. 
 How 'bout twenty? 
 Now you talkin'.

 (to Spivey) You're a witness, Doc! 
 Me? I didn't hear a thing! Let's play ball! 
 (taking the ball out) Come on, wake up, you ding-a-lings. The game is on. 
 Pass the ball, Harding... (no pass) Don't hang onto it... (no response) Pass it, goddammit! 
 Harding, here, over here! 
 (to Harding) Ya deaf! I said pass the ball! 
 I was open! Come on, let's play ball!

 WASHINGTON (CONT'D) Jus' playin' the game, sucker...

 (O.S.) Harding, get back here! 
 (calling out) Candy. Candy, over here. (to Doctor Spivey) Hey, Doc, time out. 
 (blowing his whistle) Time out! 
 Mack, you sonofabitch, you ol' fucker, how've you been? 
 (swinging her around in his arms) Terrific, baby, terrific! (to Rose) Hi ya doin', Rose? 
 (to Candy) How's your ass been holdin' up, honey? 
 Come on, girls, we're holding up the game! 
 Miss Ratched, this is my Aunt Candy and her friend Rose... 
 Miss Ratched was kind enough to save you ladies a seat... 
 Talk to ya at half time! 
 (calling after him) Sock it to 'em, kid! 
 No. 
 No, miss, it's the other way around. 
 Whadaya doin', there's no one there! 
 I saw 'em! I saw 'em. 
 Gimme the ball! 
 (holding the ball) Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me. 
 (to Spivey) Time out! 
 (blowing his whistle) Time out! 
 (shouting to Timer) Replacement coming in! Harding out! 
 (starting back up court) Time in! (sees Harding still on court) Hold it! Time out! (to Harding) I said Harding out! 
 I said out! 
 I'm the coach! 
 You can come back later! 
 (looking for another victim) Scanlon out! 
 No! 
 Martini out! 
 No! 
 Good boy, thank you, Billy. 
 (as he cuts past Harding) Harding, pass the ball! 
 (at the top of her lungs) Atta boy, Mack! (to Big Nurse) What's he in for? 
 Who? 
 Mack! 
 Miss, it's a complicated case. It would take too long to explain. 
 Yeah, well, he looks like hell! 
 (to Billy) Billy, it's not polite to stare! 
 (giving him a big smile) Hi... 
 (yelling and gesturing) Run, Chief, run! 
 (yelling and gesturing) Run, Chief, run! 
 (shouting) Foul! 
 (breathing in Washington's face) Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now! 
 (cool as a cucumber) Take you han's offa me! 
 Break it up, boys! (to Timer) Point counts. One free throw! 
 (to Washington as they line up at the foul line) We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty? 
 No way... 
 (approaching) What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night? 
 Prayin', brother. Prayin'. 
 Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay? 
 'Kay... 
 There they are, Chief! 
 Where are they goin'? 
 I thought I told you boys to go to bed! 
 (flagging the girls) Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered! 
 
 Oh yeah... 
 I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle. 
 Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed! 
 Come an' see. 
 (crossing to McMurphy) That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he? 
 You's better believe it, brother! 
 Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya! 
 (taking Turkle aside; holds up $20 bill) Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake? 
 (taking the $20 and reaching for his keys) Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees. 
 Hiya, girls... 
 Shhh... 
 Whew! Made it! 
 (embracing Candy) Man, you look good 'nough to eat! 
 Yeah, well you look like hell warmed over... 
 Hey, Mac! Gimme a hand, will ya! 
 Shhh... let's move it away from the window... 
 (arms open) Come here, sugar... 
 What happened? 
 (mystified) What? 
 Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all... 
 He's a patient, Rose... 
 Yeah... 
 He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian... 
 Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are! 
 In there. 
 They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep. 
 Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys. 
 What's that smell? 
 What smell? 
 Smells weird. Smells like pneumonia. 
 Ammonia, Miss... 
 Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down... 
 (passing the bottle to Turkle) He's in charge. 
 (passing the bottle to Rose) Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly. 
 Sure, I know Chuck. I know him. 
 Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy. 
 Is he in an asylum? 
 Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick. 
 I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first... 
 Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean... 
 Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose? 
 I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss... 
 Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities... 
 It's okay, Rose. You can go with him. 
 Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us. 
 Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face. 
 You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it... 
 Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall. 
 Go with him, Rose. Go with him. 
 That's all I'm going to show you. 
 'Kay, lets get under way. 
 Down the ol' hatch, Chief. 
 (V.O.) (through loudspeaker; very low, ominous, drawn out) Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men... 
 (V.O) (through loudspeaker) Medication time! Medication time! Rise and shine! Rise and shine! Time to say goodbye... Everybody up, up, up! 
 Up and at 'em, boys. 
 Hi, Billy.

 Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...

 Come on, get over there! 
 Thank you, Mister Washington! Mister McMurphy, do you know where Billy is? 
 (buttoning up his shirt) Morning, Miss Ratched... 
 You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here! 
 I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think? 
 Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly... 
 Who? Tell me! 
 Ahhh, Billy... 
 Get up, Billy. 
 (ignoring McMurphy) Mister Washington. 
 (helplessly to Billy) Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying... 
 Yes, Miss Ratched! 
 (to Washington) Put him in Doctor Spivey's office! 
 Yes, Miss Ratched...

 (calling from outside) Come on, come on, let's go! 
 
 Billy, oh, Billy boy... 
 Get away from him! Don't you dare touch him! 
 BROMDEN'S POV 
 (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Did everything go well, Mister Sefelt? 
 Yes, ma'am... 
 Good... 
 Hit! 
 (to Fredrickson) Ya know what, Fred? 
 What? 
 Just wait till you hear... 
 McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped... 
 Yesterday... 
 Gary Blinker... 
 Gary Blinker's fulla shit! 
 He's not! 
 He is! 
 Yes, Mister Harding? 
 No. Mister Harding, that is not true. 
 Thank you... 
 Yes, ma'am... 
 (to McMurphy) Now, let's find you a place to sit, shall we, Mister McMurphy?

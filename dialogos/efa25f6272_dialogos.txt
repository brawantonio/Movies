 ANONYMOUS,    MIAMI    1981 
 In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy- two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba.   In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. 3y the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records.   This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.' The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a stilleto and in the empty black void we:

 #I Y'ever      been     in     jail, Tony? 
 Me    jail?     No    way. We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the                                  dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's                                   a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and                                   we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer.                                    Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in                                  a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of                                  the three. MAN #l (checking off a list) You       been in a mental hospital,                Tony?

 #2 Just       answer     the    questions,     Tony. The      voices        of   the   men       remain   cool    and     collected    throughout.

 #3 So       where'd    you     get the     beauty     scar? 
     ?' This?.. (scratching the scar, shrugs) I was a kid. You should                     see   the other kid. (a grim chuckle) 
 #3 And      this? He holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between                     the thumb and second finger -- a heart with the word "Madre" scaled through it. 
 Oh       that     was   for    my sweetheart. 
 #3 Sweetheart? (to the other men) We been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda    code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin or something. This one's new...You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center? 
 Hey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.

 Hey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings. Man #3 at the door stops, looks back. 
 Send me here, send me there. This. That. Nothing you can do to me Harry, Castro didn't do -- nothing....

 So I'll sit in your lap. Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out of Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then returns the empty wrapper to Manny,

 What a thing. Conscience.    Conscience. Xf you believe you've got a conscience, 'it`ll pester you to death.   But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense. Time to go to sleep. (closes his eyes but not for long) 
 That Bogart, Chico, hunh? CONTINUED 
 That gold dust blowing in the wind. Y'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh?   Like me.... He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder, imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses, Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a pop button pinned to his shirt that says "Fuck Off and Die." And hi6 English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence more pronounced. 
 I . . don't    trust   nobody. 
 Never happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that. 
 I know. 
 Assholes,       I go crazy.      You   Manny,   I never go crazy with you. You're like my brother, I love you!

 CHI-CHI Want some new snatch? A pussycat name of Yolanda just rolled onto the Boulevard --- 
 CHI-CHI She look like you 'cept she got a snatch. 
 CHI-CHI You're       not   kidding.   It           talks. As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head for Manny.  "Later." 
 (passing) What about you sugar -- you wanna party? 
 (passing her) Yeah     with whose cock,                honey? 
 Yes? ..Hello?..Who                is this? Tony changes his mind, hangs up.  Pause. The faces of those in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth. He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive.                                 Then recognizes somebody     in       another          phone     booth   and     goes    over. 
 Angel, how ya doin'? 
 You know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!

Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro -- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico            -- they      gotta     let      us go! CONTINUED 
 You worry too much, mi hermano.  Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh? Tony     winks    and   walks   off.

The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark Columbian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, "The Lizard"; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two. The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed. 
 (checking out the room) Mind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay? Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches, the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene. `TO@ problem... This is Marta. Sure, no CONTINUED 
 Hello, Marta. She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension. 
 I'm Hector.... Pause. 
 Yeah.  I'm Tony.     So Omar says you're okay. 
 Yeah,   Omar's   okay. 
 You know Omar. 
 Omar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.

 How far's your stuff? No. Tony paces back towards, the door casually, $0 check Angel out.. .The Lizard staring at him.     .. CONTINUED 
 Not far. Pause.   Everthing seems okay. 
 So what do we do, walk in and start over? 
 (change6 subject} Where you from? Tony's eyes check out the bathroom. 
 What fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from? 
 I like to get to know who I do business with. It's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a move somewhere off-center andis now sitting on the bed, coiled and always watching. 
 You get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector. 
 Hey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't.... 
 Okay, what's the stall here?     Your guy late or something? 
 Tony! Tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening female shriek, like a bird. CONTINUED 
 (slang Spanish) Don't!    Get up! Now shithead! She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to Shoot. 
 Frog face, you just fucked up.     You steal from me, you're dead. Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less. 
 Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first?  'Fore I kill you? 
 Try sticking your head up your ass. See if it fits. Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope. Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now pull6 out of the suitcase under the bed.  Toad begin6 assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tonywith her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, not 50 ironically in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

 Now the leg, hunh? CONTINUED 
 Okay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me. He nods.

 Last chance, carajo? CONTINUED 
 Go       fuck      yourself. Toad's      eyes     narrow        meanly.

Then an old lady faints. The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identi- fication.

 Hello. 
 Uh...hi. 
 I assume we're going to be a               fivesome. Where are we having dinner? 
 Oh, I thought     we'd eat     at   the Babylon. - 1 
 Again?  If anyone wanted to assassinate you, you wouldn't be too hard to find. 
 You never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team. 
 Come    on,   Frank,   let's go. Tracking    a      cool, polished      hauteur, she    exits   the   apartment. a Lopez,     after        pause, snaps at his men.

Brain drain. 
 You    got    a   buck? 
 (indicates the machine) Put it in, let's play. 
 You check out on this and we'll talk about other things. 
 That guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar  Gomez. Bad news.   Stone killer there ever was one.   Stay away. Their point of view -- Gaspar             Gomez at a table with another guy and gorgeous woman. 
 ...the     fat guy,    with the chicas is Nacho      Contreras   -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know     it to look     at him but he's got more     cash than     anybody in here. A real      haza.... Their point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas. 
 . ..you    know what a haza is, Tony? 
 'Haza'?    No   Frank, what's     a    haza? 
 It's Yiddish for pig.   It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for.   If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it!   Lesson number one -- don't under- estimate the other guy's greed. 
 Lesson number two -- don't            get    high on your own supply. CONTINuEiD

 I think he's a fucking                peasant. 
 Yeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for     you. 
 ...so what's           your name,          Elvira what? 
 Elvira St. James.  Sounds like a nun or something.  So where you from? He bumps into an elderly couple dancing, ignores them.

It's the same sticker we saw earlier of the American flag with the epitaph, "Will the Last American leaving Miami please bring the flag."

 I   like    Frank.. -but I    like    you    better. He reaches over and takes the coke from her.    Does a toot, staring at her.   She's  uncomfortable. When he finishes he , makes as if to return it to her.    She leans to take it. He kisses her.   She goes with it. Pause.      She   pulls   back.

 so this and my other factory 1 can &&A guarantee production of 200 kilos refined every month   of the year.   Problem is I have no steady market.    Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way --- 
 I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month.... Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on.   In his skinny  suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa. 
 (meanwhile) ...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like-.-say 150 kilos a month. 
 That's a big commitment Mr. Sosa.   It's too bad Frank's not here.   Something like that you should talk to him. . CONTINUED 
 Yes, it would've been      nice    if     he    could have come. 
 (cutting  in) and he'd like meeting you too 1;;: Sosa.    But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand? 
 (taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic) So    he   sent you? 
 Yeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit. Looking over the laboratory like it was his.                Omar glances at him, annoyed. 
 We'll talk at my house.           Shall    we go.... CUT     TO 94   INT.

At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony.     The Shadow sits impas- sively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in. He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, con- stantly changing dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene). 
 (to Omar) ...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo.  You cannot do better than that. 
 Well, we do that we gotta take the . risk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You know what that means? 
 That means we gotta go to war with `em. looks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make Sosa of this guy. 
 When we cut out.the Coluxnbians we take risks -- on both sides. 
 Split the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama. 
 Panama?  Risky?   It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key. 
 13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You know what that's like these days? They got the Navy all over the fuckin' place.   They got frogmen, they got EC 2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads.   It's no duckwalk   for us anymore, y'know. Forget it. Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal. 
 What do you suggest is a fair...? Excuse me. Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly appears at the door, apparently with a message.  Sosa waves him in. The black aide Y- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair on a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling CONTINUED 
 Where were we? 
 Panama.   You're looking for a partner, right? Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony. 
 ...something like that. (chuckles) 
 Look Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here.   I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit.    I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we... 
 Hey Omar why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition. 
 Hey Montana, you got no authority here, okay ! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UQ!

 That's up to Frank -- not you. 
 I'm sorry about          this, Mr. Sosa....

 You know why they say Cubans are all screwed up? 
 Why? 
 'Cause the islands in the Caribbean, the governments in Russia, the Armys in Angola, and the people live in Miami. Sosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them. 
 (overlapping the joke) . . * They got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.

 It's     a        pleasure. 
 I gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want. Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the heli- copter rising off the lawn. 
 (focusing the binoculars) I like you Tony. There's no lying in you.. .Unfortunately I don't feel the same way about the rest of your organization. 
 In-l -- Whaddaya            getting       at, Mr. Sosa?

 He put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life.  My associate used to work up there. 
 So how do        I    know you're   not   a   'chivato' too Tony?

 (moves away) I think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this Lopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judg- ment stinks.   So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organi- zation...hunh?   You tell me Tony. 
 Hey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal.   It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know.   I'll talk to Frank myself.   I'll fix this thing up right between you. (then) You got my word on that. Sosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him, makes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony followng the pantomine, puts his out.   Sosa now grips them. 
 You speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together.  Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me. Their eyes locked together. 
 (livid) You what! You made a deal for fucking eighteen million dollars without even checking with me! What are you crazy Montana, are you crazy! 
 Hey take it easy Frank, cone. 
 Con0 my ass! 
 At 10.5 a key, it's pure Frank...we can`t lose money, no way, we make seventy-five million on this deal, Frank.   Seventy-five mill! That's serious money. 
 tx: Yeah and what's Sosa gonna do to me when I don't come up with the first five million dollars on this deal -- send me a bill? He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.

 How        do    you   do,    Mr. Montana.... He smells like a government guy.  Sosa summons                             the     black aide -- in a hushed voice. 
 Nicky, have Albert0 meet us in the living  room. The   black       aide    goes. 
 (solicitous) Tony,        come, please sit          here. 
 Tony, I want to discuss something that concerns all of us here.... CONTINUED 
 Sure, Alex. 
 Tony, you have a problem; we have a problem... I think we can solve both our problems. Tony     waits. 
 We all know you have tax troubles in your country -- and you may have to do a little time. But we have some friends in Washington who tell us these troubles can be taken care of ...maybe you'll have to pay a big fine and some back interest, but there's no      time.... 
 your problem, Alex? And Sosa looks around, stands up. 
 Come I I'll show you. Tony cautiously stands to follow him. CUT TO 168   INSERT - INT. VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE -            168 
 A "Phil     Donahue-type" setting. A segment now in progress with the      "Donahue-type" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.    (Xl Gutierrez    is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and polished    in a South American manner who exudes a sense of enormous     passion. 
 than 10,OOO'of our people are ...More being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It sells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper -- about human rights! CONTINUED 
 I've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your govern- ment receives from the drug industry in Bolivia. 
 The irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions, J i m - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine. 
 So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is -     -    - doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine.. -that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it? 
 (laughs) Let me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim...my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --- 
 . . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country.     Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Now if he's supposed Switzerland. to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register? Laughter.

 ...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese   television.   People   everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...That*s     our problem. 
 Yeah. Sosa     looks    up. 
 You've   met   Albert0    before?... 
 (remains seated) Sure.    How could I forget? 
 Alberto, you know Tony       Montana   --   my partner from Florida. 
 (to Tony) So you see Albert0 here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help... (*en) Is that a problem, Tony? Tony looks around the faces, then: 
 That's no problem, Alex.... Alex nods, pleased. Hold on Tony.         He blows his nose again. CUT TO INT.

Tony, Elvira,      and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's     shoulder. 
 Hey, Vie,   I   watch     your   show   everyday. Vie -- who we saw before editorializing on television.-- cranes his leonine white head of hair around with a patrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants. 
 Oh, is that so? 
 Yeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night? 
 .-__ . Aren't you.. .Tony Montana? CONTINUED 
 (beaming     now, ignoring     Manny who comes     to retrieve     him) Yeah,         that's me. The half-dozen          rich   people   in     the    dinner       party   are intrigued. 
 (waves to them) Hi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vie, check it out.   I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people. Waves farewell to          them, pats        Vie     once   more     on    the   shoulder, and leaves them            murmuring. 
 I don't give a fuck.   He's an ass- hole!   Never fucking tells the truth That's the trouble in this on TV! country.   Nobody fucking tells the truth! Not caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip of an anguish he does not understand. .CUT TO 173                                                                                           17: sits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars.... 
 Lot         of bullshit, that's what. Politics. The         whole world's turning into politics. 
 Yeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what? Manny    remembers. 
 No     free    rides   in this        world,       kid. 
 What     guy? 
 (to Manny) You stay out of it. Run things down here.   1'11 be up in New York next week. He   takes   a     hit,    unnoticed. 
 (unheard) What     guy? 
 You don't like it!   It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum! 
 Why don't you eat your                    food,     what's wrong with it? .. CONTINulm 
 I'm     not    hungry. 
 So    what'd       you     order it       for? 
 I     lost    my    appetite. She   does the other nostril. Tony looking                         at    her.     One     beat. Two   beats. He passes a silent burp. 
 (ignoring the question) Is this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?  Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what? You're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here? Is that what it's all about? 
 (doesn't hear) . . I is that what I worked 'for? With these hands?      Is that what I killed for?     For this? (turns his gaze stonily on Elvira) A junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me 'cause she's in a coma! 
 ...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it man, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby! 
 You     sonufabitch!      You fuck! They got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping around to clean up the mess.  Tony slowly wiping the food off   himself. 
 How dare you talk to me like that! You call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people? Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming! The       audience    is hushed, involved, the camera moving over the      faces of     Vie and his rich friends. 
 Sit    down   before   I kill    you. 
 * . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony.     But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons around all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that? CONTINUED 
 (softly) Go on, get a cab home,                you're    stoned. (to Manny) Manny. 
 I'm not stoned Tony. You're No, stoned.  You're so stoned you don't even know it. 
 All        right   I'm    stoned.   Manny. 
 No,  no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you...I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone... (staring at Tony) I'm leaving you.   I don't need this shit anymore. Pause.    She starts wobbling out. Past the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. 
 Let her go! ..Another guaalude                     and she'll lpve me again. Tony's Stumbling once, Elvira disappears               out      the     door. eyes follow her.   Pause. .. CONTINUED 
 You're all assholes. You know why? 'Cause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be. He wobbles        against   the   table.    Manny   tries     to    help.    Tony shakes him        loose. 
 You need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!'   So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me I don't have that problem.   I always tell the truth -- even when I lie. He     starts     out,   staggers. 
 So say good night to the bad guy... You're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.

 (English) Hey okay I don't give a shit where, okay, you can blow him up when you like okay, just tell me okay -- when you like. The chatter comes out jagged, irritating the Shadow who doesn't understand Tony's English anyway.

 _ (Spanish) No! Mr. Sosa says we do it now. We do it. Co -0 He has the strength of a born psychopath, brooking no other reality but his own. He stares a hole through Tony who gives way to his intensity, going into a slow angry burn at himself, putting the sedan in gear and going after Matos, muttering to himself. 
 ...aw  fuck        this, this         fuckin' asshole! Chi-Chi,         in   the   back, looks       on     worried.                                     (X

Well fuck      that! I don't need that shit in my life. His face twisted in agony, he reaches down and snaps his Baretta free from his ankle holster. He swings it around sharply, levelling it on the Shadow. 
 motherfucker! The Shadow glances over at Tony, astonished. Tony pumps two shots point-blank into him, blowing his face off and smashing him against the door of the moving sedan, blood and brains splattering the windows and the seat covers. 
 CHI-CHI Oh Jesus Christ!     Jesus Christ! What the.... Tony swerving the sedan back across the Avenue, the traffic around them honking and moving along at its normal pace as the Shadow's body slumps down out of sight, another Monday morning traffic accident with blood and brains splattered up against a passenger window and nobody really sees... except a six-year-old girl in an adjacent vehicle; she wonders momentarily, then dismisses it.

 Yeah, it's you drove her nuts with your nagging and bitchin'. 
 (continuing) ...and you did the same thing to me.   I wasn't this, I wasn't that -- never good enough for you.   I never felt nothing from you, Mama -- nothing! 
 First time I       ever needed   you,   where were you?. . .

I'm somebody and I'm proud of it. 
 (to Chi-Chi) Wait here. He approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket.  Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits. the pause. The door opens casually. Standing             there Hold is Manny -- with a towel around his waist. 
 Tony! (eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm) Tony with his Baretta pointed at Max-my, his expression filled with loathing. Manny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge. 
 Tony! No! Tony fires a second time. Manny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb, eyes on Tow, terribly surprised. Tony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself. Manny lies at his feet, dead. CONTINUED 
 Manny! 
 Manny! 
 You     killed       him? Shaking     her     head     at    him    incredulously. 
 We got married just yesterday. We were gonna surprise you. 
 Manolo, oh Manolo, what'd                  he     do?.. What'd he do? She hugs his corpse tightly to her                        breast and       makes horrible strangled sounds with her                        throat. 
 CHI-CHI come    on.    We gotta       get    out   of Tony, here. (to Gina) Come     on     baby...Gina! 
 Noooooooooooo! And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him.   She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed. 
 (to  Chi-Chi) Get     the body! 
 CHI-MI Tony! 
 Yeah! 
' MaMy!..Manny!                 No! CUT    TO   - 22: MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 221 The white            Corniche        whistles     by    like      a   hearse      heading   for hell.

How the fuck!..oh Manny, Manny.. .you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood... well what the hell happened, hunh? What the hell happened to us?... In far b-g. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see: The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into                       (X view, checks the gate, turns.  Suddenly two figures spring out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles. Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito A    third   monitor.    carries     another   image   of    shadows   moving through the trees on the estate. On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost incoherent. 
 ...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would you sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh --   the   fucking      best.... As  Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade.                     A shadow starts climbing up as: 
 ...we still are Manny, we still are -- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines.       Fan     mail.     Television stars, movie stars, shooting              stars -- he's a star.... 
 Is     this    what       you want      Tony?... Tony     shocked. 
 You can't stand another man                         touching me.  So you want me Tony, is                        that it? Well here I am 0-T She    fires    the    Baretta       we    now   see    in    her    hand. 
 I'm all        yours       Tony,       I'm all yours now. Bullets ripping into the desk.   She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals. 
 Come and get me Tony.                   Before       it's too     late. 
 Come on Tony, fuck           me!       Fuck       me! Fuck me! 
 Get outta Tony,         they're    everywhere! here! Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of                    (X silencer bullets. We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull, moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly underneath the balcony on which Tony stands. 
 (gently) Hey     Gina come on, you still angry at me?      I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was..    .I   was. 
 CHI-CHI Boss !    Hey boss.     Open up! On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade goes off, blows him up against the door. 
 Cheeee! He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor. On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs. Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out. Tony loading his rocket, ihtends to beat them to the punch, talking to himself. 
 So you wanna play hunh, say hello                    (XI to my little friend here. Karroooomph! The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian It sounds like punks off the landing into the foyer. Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly. Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling. CONTINUED 
 Whores!  Cowards!   You think you                          (X) can kill me with lousy bullets hunh? 
 Who you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes.  I take you all to fuckin' hell! Left.    Right Another hitter   drops,   screaming, off the stairs into the pool below. A grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing away.  Laughing like a madman. 
 You need an army you hear!    An army to kill me! Behind him we see the remainder of the     pound of cocaine go up in a burst of wind, whipping around    the office in auras of white.  It is a ghostly effect out     of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the     terrace towards    _ Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun. 
 Ha ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces !!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!! Skull, now inches from Tony's back,     pulls   the   trigger The and blows Tony's spine out his belly. Tony crashes forward over the bannister into the interior swimming pool below. He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters. As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety. The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters.   It says: "THE WORLD IS YOURS" And so, for the brief moment, it was. CONTINUED

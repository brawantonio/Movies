 
 Just give him toast. 
 T.J. (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
 Listening for the trucks. 
 Yeah. 
 T.J. (CONT'D) (says it slow) Where's dad? 
 I don't know how he found it, T.J. 
 T.J. (CONT'D) The money? 
 I locked it in my glove compartment. 
 Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened. 
 Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out. 
 He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. I thought it would be okay! 
 T.J. (CONT'D) What are you gonna do? 
 Nothing. 
 He could be anywhere. 
 Where? 
 With more than four thousand dollars, he's probably in Atlantic City by now. 
 (CONT'D) 
 I can't. 
 I just can't do it anymore. 
 T.J., we can't make him stop. 
 It's not stealing if you take it from your family. Anyway, he made some of it, too. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Is it here? 
 Hey, little sleepy head. 
 Is it here yet? `Cause I'm ready. 
 Wait a sec- 
 We're all ready for ya'. 
 We'll need the balloon payment to unload. 
 We have it, it's just that they called Troy from Titus last night. That's where Troy works. The ski place? And anyway- 
 Have you got the $4,372 dollars or not? 
 It was some emergency with the lifts. So he took off without thinking with the money. Completely forgot you were coming. So as soon as he gets back- 
 When's he gonna be back? 
 As soon as he can get here, I'll just run it down to you. 
 (ironic smile) This is the second time you've dragged me out here. If you don't come up with it by Christmas, you've lost your fifteen hundred dollar deposit. 
 Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna make me a manager after Christmas so I can handle the payments if you just leave the house- 
 Call me when you have the balloon payment. 
 I'll call you... 
 Wait, where are they going? 
 Listen to me. We'll get them back. 
 But why are they leaving? 
 Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise, honey. 
 That's our house! 
 We're gonna get it back. 
 RAY (CONT'D) (to T.J.) You better hurry or you're going to miss the bus. Let's get your clothes on, Ricky. 
 You're 15, T.J. 
 You're finishing school. 
 You're going to school. 
 Where's daddy? 
 He'll be back. 
 No! I'm going to work and you're going to school. 
 The only thing that changed is that your dad started gambling again. Everything else is the same. 
 Where did he go? 
 He had to take a business trip. 
 And miss a day of work? No. Not again. We just have to live our lives. Now go get your backpack. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Go on! 
 When is daddy coming home? 
 I don't know, Ricky. 
 Where? Where do I look? (He can't answer) 
 I told you, he could be in Atlantic City by now. 
 You're going to school. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Wait, wait. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Here. Lunch money. 
 (soft) Matt. Could I talk to you? 
 RAY (CONT'D) I need to come on full-time. 
 I see you as a short timer. 
 What is that? 
 A short timer. Not here for long, not really committed. 
 When I started you said it would be six months before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago. 
 It's my opinion. 
 Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat's late everyday. She's late now. She's always late. 
 RAY (CONT'D) See ya' tomorrow. 
. 
 Fill it up? 
 Just three...uh, no...two seventy one, two, three, four. 
 Two seventy four. 
 (yells out window) Make that seven seventy four. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here last night? 
 Blue Acclaim...no, but I only worked until 9 PM. You can ask inside. 
 No, that's okay. 
 Did you want to support our Mosquito Lacrosse League. It teaches basic Lacrosse skills to the kids three to five. 
 Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you thank you... 
 RAY (CONT'D) You son of a bitch! 
 Sunrise session is almost over. Next session starts at 10:30. 
 I just need to look inside. 
 It's $5 dollars for admission. 
 I don't want to play, I just need to look around for a second. 
 I'm gonna need the five. 
 I'll stand right here at the door. I won't even go inside. I just need to see if my husband's in there. 
 You still gotta pay admission. 
 He's gambling away the money for our house. 
 What does he look like? 
 Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail. 
 He's not in there. 
 Can I just look? 
 I told you, lady, he's not in there. 
 Hey! 
 That's my car. 
 Huh? 
 (points to the Acclaim) What are you doing with my car? 
 That? I found it. 
 You stole it. 
 The keys were in it. 
 So you just took it...? 
 RAY (CONT'D) We'll just see what the troopers say about that. 
 (O.S.) (From inside camper) Go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here. This is Mohawk territory. 
 (knocks with the gun) You can cut the bullshit and give me my keys now. 
 RAY (CONT'D) (low voice) Troy, are you in there? 
 RAY (CONT'D) If you're in there you better come out. 
 (O.S.) (tentative, controlled) Troy? Versales says as long as we get the money in by Christmas we won't lose the deposit. (pause) I think we need to talk about this, so come on out.(Pause) Troy? Troy? 
 (O.S.) I'm not kidding, honey, come on out. 
 (from behind the door) The Tribal police don't like people shooting holes in other people's houses. 
 This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys! 
 This camper belongs to my brother in law. He won't like this. 
 (over her shoulder) Then you should quit stealing cars. 
 I thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it got on a bus. 
 Did you see where the bus was headed? 
 New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure. 
 (under her breath) Shit! 
 RAY (CONT'D) I'm not leaving this here. 
 (points at the Acclaim) I got a friend who might buy that. 
 It's not for sale. 
 He'll pay more than it's worth. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Maybe two thousand. 
 Why's that? 
 He's always looking for cars with button- release trunks. 
 LILA (CONT'D) He don't need papers or anything. 
 Does he use them to rob banks or something? 
 All I know is he pays good for a car like this. 
 Where does he live? 
 Through the woods. Not far. 
 What's in it for you? 
 He'll give me something for finding it. 
 If you try anything, I'm not afraid to use this. 
 Yeah. 
 Turn up there. 
 Where? 
 Where that stump is. 
 (nervous) There's no road. 
 There's a path. 
 LILA (CONT'D) It's not far. 
. 
 Not too fast. There's ruts. 
 I'm not crossing that! 
 Don't worry they already put out the Christmas trees. There's no black ice. 
 That's Canada. 
 No, it's Mohawk land. The Rez is on both sides of the river. 
 What about the border patrol? 
 There's no border. 
 I'm still not crossing that. 
 Don't worry, it'll hold a Plymouth. I've seen semis cross it. 
 LILA (CONT'D) The only other way is the Cornwall bridge and they won't let you take that. (points at the gun). 
 LILA (CONT'D) They plow it and everything. 
 (under her breath) This is so fuckin' stupid. 
 Not too fast, there are ruts. 
 You gotta pick up some speed to get up the bank. 
 LILA (CONT'D) It's just on the other side of those trees. 
 Honk the horn. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Just keep your mouth shut. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Just keep it shut. Okay? 
 Thunder! SHUT UP!. 
 JIMMY (CONT'D) Get back under there! 
 Hi, Jimmy. 
 He don't like whites, Lila. 
 Sorry. 
 And your late. 
 Sorry. 
 I shouldn't even be dealing with you. 
 I know. Sorry. 
 Count it. 
 What's going on here? 
 Just count it. 
 LILA (CONT'D) How much is there? 
 Twelve hundred. 
 (to Ray) Let's go. 
 Wait, who the fuck are they? 
 Just back up. 
 I'm not moving until those people get out of my trunk. 
 I'll give you half. Now let's go. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Let's go! 
 I'm not taking them over the border. That's a crime. 
 There's no border here. This is free trade between nations. 
 This isn't a nation. 
 (under her breath) Let's go. 
 Why'd your husband leave you? 
 Fuck you. 
 Maybe he wanted a younger women. 
 LILA (CONT'D) That's what usually happens. 
 LILA (CONT'D) I never have to worry about that. My husband is dead. Went down in the river on a run. They never found him. Probably tangled in river weeds. 
 LILA (CONT'D) You better slow down there are ruts out here. You could get stuck in one. 
". 
 Keep going. 
 What if the troopers stop us. 
 They won't stop you. You're white. 
 Pull around back then wait for him to come to the window. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Roll down your window. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Count it. 
 Twelve hundred. 
 Let's go. 
 Turn down there. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Stop here. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Now open the door. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Open the door. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Now get out. 
 You can't have my car. 
 Get out. 
 You can't have my car. 
 RAY (CONT'D) No! 
 RAY (CONT'D) (gasps) Fuckin' bitch! 
 RAY (CONT'D) (calls after her) Little bitch! 
 I told you not to use that thing when I'm not here. 
 I don't care. Don't use that thing when I'm not here! 
 T.J. (CONT'D) Did you find him? 
 No. 
 At the bus stop on the Rez. 
 You don't know that. 
 And then what? Chase him across the country. Miss work. No. 
 Nothin'. 
 It was no big deal. 
 Some Indian chick tried to steal your Dad's car. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 I'll get it tomorrow. 
 I didn't have a tow rope. 
 Forget it T.J. Did you and Ricky eat? 
 There's food. 
 (In Mohawk) Hi, Lila 
 (In Mohawk) Mike. 
 How's life at the Bingo Palace. 
 Good. How's business? 
 Oh, you know, okay. 
 How much for that one? 
 Come on, Lila. 
 What?! I've been saving up. 
 You know what. 
 Does Bernie Littlewolf run your whole life? 
 No, but he said not to sell you a car. 
 I gotta walk down 37 with the semis kickin' up snow and mud in my hair just to get to the work. 
 For you, all I got are two Chevettes,a Horizon and a Civic. 
 I don't like Chevettes. 
 I figured. 
 I'll give you a thousand for the Malibu. 
 Nothing with a trunk. 
 That thing has been sittin' here for six months. 
 I don't want Bernie in my face. Okay? 
 He doesn't have to know. 
 Mommy, I was thinking. What's gonna happen to the tin crapper when we get our new house? 
 (half asleep) They're gonna flatten it out and send it to China. 
 Then what? 
 They're gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it. 
 Then what? 
 They'll send them back here so I can sell them at All for a Dollar. 
 And you can buy me some? 
 That's right. 
 Yes! 
 We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday. 
 What about them? 
 You told me that already. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Here, lunch money. 
 (to T.J.) Who's Mitch. 
 He sells pot to kids? 
 You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so forget it. 
 Your job is looking after your brother. Who's gonna take care of him? 
 (low tone) I want my part. 
 (O.S.) (knocks with the gun) You hear me! 
 RAY (CONT'D) I want my part. 
 RAY (CONT'D) I want my part. 
 I'll give you the money if you give me the car. 
 No way. 
 The money's gone. 
 Then I wanna get some more of those Chinese. 
 It's gonna cost me to get that hole fixed. I froze last night. 
 I just need enough for the balloon payment on my doublewide then I'm out of this. I'm no criminal. 
 It's not a crime. 
 You people can call it what you want to. I just want my double. 
 I don't usually work with whites. 
 Suit yourself. 
 How many bedrooms? 
 Three. I got kids. 
 How old? 
 Five and Fifteen. 
 I got a boy. Almost one. 
 LILA (CONT'D) He lives with my mother-in-law. (after a moment) She stole him from me. 
 Stole him? 
 Yeah. Right out of the hospital. 
 Stole him? 
 Tribal police don't get involved in stuff like that. 
 Bernie was askin' if I'd seen you. I told him no. 
 Thanks. 
 I don't want any trouble with him, Lila. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 This guy's been calling all morning. He's got two up at the Old Casino. 
 Okay. 
 What's going on? 
 We gotta pick them up. 
 (hesitates) Where? 
 Not far. 
 Where's that? 
 An old casino through the woods. They used to have gambling there in the bootlegger days. 
 What the hell is he doing? 
 Keep that thing down. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Roll down the window and see what he wants. 
 What the hell is going on here? 
 Just roll it down. 
 (Quebec-French accent) D'ey don't like de women driver. 
 Count it. 
 Twelve hundred. 
. 
 Open it. 
 D'is will keep d'em from running. 
 Why would they want to run? 
 To get away from the snakeheads. 
 What's that? 
 The snakeheads pay to get them here and then they gotta work off what they owe . 
 How much does it cost? 
 Forty, fifty thousand. Depends where they're coming from. 
 To get here? 
 Sometimes they gotta work for years to pay it off. 
 (disbelief) To get here? No fuckin' way. 
 RAY (CONT'D) God those are ripe. 
 They always stink. 
 T.J. (CONT'D) -I'm the business manager of Mr. E.F. ThreeRivers and I have been authorized to inform you that you have inherited money. -Are you still there? -Wait, I don't WANT any money, I want to GIVE you money. -That's right. You have inherited money from his computer fortune. -He was the second richest man next to Bill Gates. -He left you Twenty-six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars.(pause) -TWENTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND 
! -Oh no, you have no obligation whatsoever, Mrs. ThreeRivers, just a small processing fee of 29.00 dollars will authorize me to send out your first payment of thirteen-thousand three hundred and seventy five dollars. -You can put it on any major credit card. (pause) Of course, you can always refuse the money. -Sure, I can hold. 
 Are they always there? 
 Yeah, but they can't stop you unless you give them a reason. 
 Have you ever gotten caught? 
 Once. 
 What happened? 
 They gave me the choice of paying a fine or spending three months in jail. 
 What did you do? 
 I paid the fine. I made the money back in two nights of smuggling. But back then it was cigarettes and everybody did it. Some of the troopers were into it, too. 
 Smuggling? 
 Yeah. But when they lowered the tax on cigarettes in Canada most people got out of it and the rest switched over to Chinese. 
 Count it. 
 Right, I know. 
 Well, be sure it's right. I don't wanna get stiffed. 
 Then why don't you count it? 
 I got bad eyes. 
 You're welcome. 
 What about mine? 
 We're even now. 
 (weary) We only take cash or money orders. 
 She's got three minutes. 
 It's okay. I got it right here. (she waves a wad of fifties and twenties). Two fifty five, right? 
 Mommy! 
 (to Ricky) Who wants to go the Price Chopper and get some Cap'n Crunch? 
 I DO! 
 Wanna to go to the Price Chopper? 
 (a beat) Matt made me an assistant manager. 
 Is that so hard to believe? 
 Exactly, and that's why he gave me a bonus. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Do you wanna go to the Price Chopper or not? 
 Chance! Chance, get in here before you freeze your ass off. 
 (O.S.) Temps will dip tonight and tomorrow. Expect a Clipper from Northern Ontario to bring 8 to 12 inches of snow and winds gusting 25-45 miles an hour making it feel like minus 30. Area farmers are advised to bring in livestock. More on this after a message. 
 What? 
 What is it, again? 
 -Hot Wheels Tech Trax, what? 
 I got something even better than that. 
 The double wide. But don't mention it to Ricky, just in case. 
 This time is for real. 
 Yes it is. We're getting a tub, T.J. It's gonna happen. 
 If you keep that attitude I'll never let you use it. 
 What about him? 
 Why, did he call broke yet? 
 Oh, here we go again with Saint Dad. 
 He's an addict, T.J. 
 You gotta help Ricky get the tree up tomorrow after school okay? 
 Christmas shopping. 
 RAY'S VOICE Hi, it's me. leave a message, and maybe I'll call ya back. 
 (fake cheerful) Hi....it's me...leave a message and I'll call ya' back. 
 RAY (CONT'D) (less cheerful, forced) Hey, leave me a message and I'll call ya' back. (under her breath) You son of a bitch. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you are alive, because the boys are worried about you. 
 (O.S.) Hey, I just got done here. I made two hours overtime fixing one of the snow- making machines. Pretty cool, huh? I'll be home late. I'm gonna catch that meeting at 7:30. Love you, bye. 
 Lila. Get up. I got a job for you! 
 (O.S.) Lila! Get up. 
 BERNIE (CONT'D) They got two people out sick today, so if you get down there you got the job. 
 Huh? 
 Get dressed, I got coffee. Let's go! 
 Where is it? 
 Get in, I'll tell you on the way. 
 Rita said you quit. 
 She fired me. 
 That's not what she said. 
 Well, she should have. I can't see to count the money. I told you that. I come up short half the time. 
 Then get some glasses. 
 They make me carsick. 
 Gimme a break. 
 So where are we going? 
 The Tribal Council needs someone to answer phones. 
 No way! 
 Why not? You can answer a phone, can't you? 
 Not there! Not with them. 
 (suspicious) What's that? 
 I bought it. 
 From who? 
 Some white lady. 
 LILA (CONT'D) What? 
 What do you need a car for? 
 To get to work. So I don't have to walk in the breakdown lane. Last week I almost got hit by the plow. 
 You'll live. And you know what I'm talking about. 
 It doesn't have a trunk. 
 LILA (CONT'D) All right, all right! I'll go. 
 That's $87.50. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Sorry. Didn't go through. 
 RAY (CONT'D) (in a low voice) I can try to put it though again. 
 (yells back at Ray) You got a problem with your machine, lady! 
 (rings him up) That'll be three seventy six. 
 I got exact. 
 Do I have any messages? 
 ROSALIE (CONT'D) I can't read this. 
 I think it's a "T.". 
 No, I can't read any of it. 
 I told Bernie I couldn't see. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Nevermind. I'll go. 
 We gotta get extra fluid. 
 I gotta get back before KMART closes. 
 What for? 
 I got nothing for under the tree. 
 Don't you people even take Christmas Eve off? 
 Mohawks don't celebrate Christmas. 
 You could fool me the way they were all lined up at All for a Dollar today. 
 Those are Christians. The converted. 
 From what? 
 From the Longhouse ways. 
 That's awful not to have Santa Claus-- for the kids, I mean. 
 Daddy is gettin' me that for Christmas. 
 He's bringing the new house. 
 Wait. They're not Chinese. 
 They're "Pakis." 
 What does that mean? 
 They're from Pakistan. 
 Well where's that? 
 I don't know. What difference does it make? 
 A big difference. 
 If we wait much longer we won't be able to get back across the river. 
 Look, I'm not driving just anybody across the border. 
 Do you want the money or not? 
 I wanna know what's in the bag. 
 RAY (CONT'D) What's in there? 
 They don't understand you. 
 Well, if they want to come over here so bad, they ought'a take the time to learn English. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Just hold on a second. 
 I'll take that. 
 If we keeps snowing like this we won't be able to get across the river. 
 I just hope these aren't the ones that blow up themselves and everybody with them. 
 We don't have time. 
 Is that a two or a five? 
 (glances down) A five. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Shit! 
 You gotta stop so I can fill up the wiper fluid. 
 I'm not stoppin'. 
 It's a hundred feet deep out here if we get on black ice 
 LILA (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
 Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't tell what they might have in there. I'm not gonna be responsible for that. 
 RAY (CONT'D) -Hi, I'm gonna be a little late.(pause) -I have to work. Is Ricky asleep? -Put him on. (pause) -Ricky listen to me, he's not coming until you go to sleep. (pause) (MORE) 
 RAY (CONT'D) -No. Not yet. He's still flyin' over Canada okay? He's not even done with Canada yet, so he's not coming until you get to sleep. Now put your brother on. -I'll be home in a little while, okay? -No, I haven't got it,yet. What's it called again? -Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt whatever, right, right, I'll get it if I can! -I can't promise T.J. -There are more important things to get for Christmas this year. Be home in a little while. Okay, bye. 
 RAY (CONT'D) (to Lila) You'd think a new house would be enough. 
 T.J. (CONT'D) -Hi Mitch. It's T.J. No, T.J. from school. Yeah, man. Right. Uh, I was wondering if you still needed those numbers we were talking about `cause I got one. -How much? -Cool, but the thing is I don't really have any wheels at the moment. -On Moira road off 37. -Yeah, but there's one more thing...(he whispers into the phone inaudibly)...no the air stunt challenge set. -Yeah, exactly. Yeah, man. Thanks a lot. Bye. 
 T.J. (CONT'D) (to Ricky) Ricky, time to eat. 
 Hey T.J., watch this! 
 T.J. (CONT'D) Now unwrap yourself, it's dinner time. 
 (heavy accent) They say there's a bag. 
 It was too heavy. We had to unload it. 
 RAY (CONT'D) What's the matter with her!? 
 She had something in the bag. 
 What is she saying!? 
 She says her baby. Her baby was in the bag. 
 It didn't feel like there was anything in that bag. 
 We gotta go back. 
 I can't believe they put their baby in a duffle bag. 
 I can't believe you left it out there. 
 If you'd let me search it I would never have taken it- 
 We gotta go back. 
 I know! I know that. 
 That's what you wanted, right? 
 Thanks Man, Have a Merry One. 
 Look, there. Tracks. 
 (squints) Where? 
 Up there. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Slow down, I don't want to run over it. Stop. I think it was here. 
 RAY'S VOICE (faintly heard though the phone) Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you're alive, because the boys are worried about you. 
 It's dead. 
 Come on! 
 It's dead. 
 Tap the bottom of his feet. 
 Why? 
 That's what they did to get Ricky breathing when he was born. 
 I don't want to touch it. 
 Well, I can't hold it and drive. 
 I don't think it matters. 
 At least put him next to your body. That will warm him up. 
 But it's too late. 
 Just do it! We can't give it back to her cold. 
 Shit! 
 Calm down. 
 Oh shit. What do I do? 
 Calm down. Just pull over. 
 What if he saw us go by before. To Bob's. 
 He's got no reason to stop us, unless you give him one, so keep your mouth shut. 
 What if he searches the car. What do we say about- 
 He won't, just remember you're white. 
 License and registration? 
 (fakely nice) I wasn't speeding, was I? 
 Just step out of the car. 
 Did I do something? 
 (suspicious) Ma'am I'm just directing you to step out of the vehicle? 
 Okay. 
 Step around to the back of the vehicle. 
 See that. 
 Oh, I didn't know. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Thanks. 
 (he looks into the car) Who's your friend? 
 She looks after my kids when I have to work late. 
 Have an enjoyable Holiday. 
 Yeah, you, too. 
 (nervous) What did he want? 
 Just a blown out tail light. 
 That's it? 
 Yeah. 
 We gotta take it in. 
 RAY (CONT'D) What is it? 
 It's moving. 
 What? Are you sure? 
 Hello little baby. 
 He was just cold. 
 We found him. 
 RAY (CONT'D) (to Lila) Come on. Let's go. 
 He was dead. 
 He was just cold. 
 He was dead. 
 Okay, whatever, you brought him back to life. 
 That was the Great Spirit, not me. 
 All I know is Kmart is closed and I got nothing for under the tree. 
 RAY (CONT'D) What? 
 RAY (CONT'D) Look, I don't have time for that. I can't get deep about every little thing. I just have to keep on going. I only need one more run to have enough for my double. 
 Here. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Merry Christmas or whatever. 
 Yeah. 
 What's that? 
 Where'd you get it? 
 Mitch? Is that the friend you called? It's probably stolen, you know. 
 Well, I don't want you hanging around him. That kid is bad news. 
 Look , Mister, I got more important things to worry about than toys. I'm trying to get our doublewide. 
 Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway, Kmart was closed by the time I got off work. 
 RAY (CONT'D) What's that smell? 
 I told you to be careful with the microwave, didn't I? 
 Bernie! 
 Daddy? 
 Is there a Ray Eddy here? 
 Yes. 
 Can I speak to you outside for a minute. 
 I haven't gotten the light fixed- 
 It's not about that. I just have a few questions. 
 Sure. 
 This is about the woman who was with you. 
 Yes. 
 How long have you known her? 
 Not too long. She looks after my kids. 
 She's a smuggler. 
 Really? 
 Yes. 
 Wow. That's a shock. 
 Yes, well, there is that element on the Reservation I'm sure you know. 
 Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't know she was involved. 
 How did you happen to meet her? 
 Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I get my gas. 
 I just thought you should be aware of that. She's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country. 
 Oh my God. 
 If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter. You don't want her around young kids. 
 Absolutely. 
 Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday. 
 Thanks. You, too. 
 Why is the police man here? 
 (O.S.) T.J. could you come out here for a minute. 
 No. 
 Did you have a fire last night? 
 You fixed um? 
 Did you happen to use the blow torch? 
 RAY (CONT'D) Look at this. We can't live here anymore! 
 No, it was our house. 
 Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother. 
 Put it down. 
 Put it down. 
 Put that thing down! 
 That was an accident. 
 He spent the food money on scratch cards, T.J. 
 Gimme that thing. 
 RAY (CONT'D) T.J. come on now. 
 He was clean for 23 months. 
 RAY (CONT'D) (chokes back tears) I didn't know how else to keep us together. I mean...he's a good dad when he's not gamblin'. 
 I know. 
 The game's over. They're verifying the last winner. 
 That's okay. I still wanna buy a ticket. 
 I can't sell you one. 
 I got money. 
 Sorry. 
 I just want to buy some scratch cards. 
 Go to Wolf Mart, they sell `um there. 
 I quit smuggling. 
 (rolls down the window) T.J. set the trailer on fire. 
 RAY (CONT'D) He didn't mean to, but the pipes froze and he got that damn torch out -- which I told him not to do touch when I wasn't there -- and he tried to thaw them out- 
 I got glasses and now I can see up close. 
 There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We gotta move. 
 RAY (CONT'D) I just need one more run to get the double. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay? 
 I don't want it. 
 What is it then?! 
 RAY (CONT'D) Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. I mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag? 
 RAY (CONT'D) You're gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby. 
 I got enough. 
 Yeah, but you gotta get him first. 
 RAY (CONT'D) I'll help you. You can even borrow my gun. 
 You should see the inside. 
 How many bedrooms? 
 Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom. 
 Wall to wall carpet? 
 Oh yeah. But the best thing is the insulation. The pipes can never freeze. 
 RAY (CONT'D) I'll be back. 
 ...what I think you'll find with the Commodore -- and you'll be the judge -- is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children. There is never a need to repaint or even touch up- 
 I wanna schedule a delivery. 
 (to the couple) Give me just a second. 
 VERSAILLES (CONT'D) What do you want? 
 VERSAILLES (CONT'D) Is this all of it? 
 It's three thousand but I want it delivered tomorrow. 
 I told you all or nothing. 
 Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is show up. If I don't have the rest you keep it. 
 Can't argue with that. You'll have to sign something, though. 
 Blow the horn. 
 Heat wave! 
 You got a run for us, Jimmy? 
 (shakes his head) It's pretty slow after Christmas. Unless you wanna to go off the Rez, there's a guy up in Montreal who's usually got heads. 
 How far? 
 Twenty miles or so. But...you gotta watch out for the Mounties and the Surete. and...this guy deals in ya' know girls. 
 Have you ever been there? 
 A few times. Have you? 
 No, Troy didn't like to travel. He liked to work in his shed, mostly. 
 Up there. That's it. 
 Can't miss that. 
 Oui? 
 Bruno. 
 (French accent) You looking for a job. 
 No, Jimmy called- 
 Oh yeah, Jimmy. Okay. 
 (softly) Put your hands up. 
 Okay we go. 
 BRUNO (CONT'D) D'is way. 
 D'at your car? 
 BRUNO (CONT'D) Open the trunk. 
 We need to get paid, first. 
 Oh, yes. 
 You only got six hundred here. 
 You get the rest at drop off. 
 It's six hundred apiece. 
 That's the deal I make with Jimmy, now you want to change? 
 It's twelve hundred. 
 You want to make a problem? 
 BRUNO (CONT'D) (annoyed by Ray) ...because you're not making a problem for me. And you're making a problem for them. Let me show you something. 
 (to Ray) Let's just go. 
 Okay. We'll take them. 
 Let's go. 
 Just open the trunk. 
 You must be the brains of the operation. 
 Turn around! 
 RAY (CONT'D) I want the rest. 
 (cool) I don't have any more. 
 (to the Bartender) Go get it. 
 (to the bartender) Give it to her. 
 (from inside the Acclaim) Let's get out of here. I'll give you the rest of the money. 
 No. But thanks. 
 You're gonna get us all killed. 
 Put it there. 
 (to the bartender) You aren't so smart as you look. 
 He shot me. 
 You should'a just taken the money from me? 
 (blood streams down her face) I'm tired of people stealing from me.    Is it all there? 
 We gotta get outta here, first. 
 Just COUNT IT and make sure it's all there! 
 RAY (CONT'D) Is it there? 
 It's all there. 
 Good. 
 Slow down a little. We gotta keep it under the speed limit. 
 LILA (CONT'D) We gotta get off this road. 
 "ARRET" 
 LILA (CONT'D) Slow down! 
 I can't. 
 We gotta get off this road! 
 How much farther to the reservation? 
 Just up at the tree line. 
 What the hell? We're on the reservation. 
 They can't arrest us but if they catch us they'll take the money. 
 Shit! 
 That ice is black out here. 
 Will it hold us? 
 I don't know. 
 ...the Quebec Surete in pursuit of a vehicle with New York State plates, identified as a blue Plymouth Acclaim and the suspects are two women, suspected to be carrying illegals... 
. 
 We gotta crawl out the window. 
. 
 Hi Mom. 
 Jimmy, I told you not to bring no more half frozen people in here off the river. 
 (ignores her) We just need to borrow your oven, Mom. 
 I don't see how I can get any baking done. I'm supposed to be baking 200 doughnuts for pee wee Lacrosse and now I have people bleeding and dripping all over my kitchen. 
 VELMA (CONT'D) (to Ray) Sit down, I can't reach up that high. 
 VELMA (CONT'D) (to Ray) Looks like somebody tried to blow your brains out. 
 VELMA (CONT'D) Get outta here, Jimmy. They gotta strip down. (to girls) Gimme those jackets. 
 VELMA (CONT'D) Somebody's been beatin' up on you. 
 VELMA (CONT'D) You, too. 
 -Good, good Mike. What can I do for you? - -You say non-native smugglers? -A white woman? On the Rez? -I'll look into it and give you a call back. Sure thing. (pause) -I'll take your request to the Tribal Council and give you a call back. -No problem, Mike. You bet. 
 Hi, Rosalie. 
 (puts on her glasses) Billy. 
 We have a situation with a couple smugglers. They got chased by the Quebec police and crossed the river but their car went in and now the troopers know they're on the Rez. 
 Who is it? 
 Lila Littlewolf and some white woman. 
 What do the troopers want? 
 A surrender of the two illegals and the Non-Native smuggler. They need an example here. 
 Do you know where they are? 
 Probably over at Velma's. 
 (to the other Chiefs) What do you think? 
 Turn them in. 
 What about Lila Littlewolf? 
 We got our own court system. 
 We don't charge people with smuggling. 
 Maybe we should. 
 If we did, we'd have to arrest half the people on the Rez. 
 We can expel her. 
 You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the Rez, Rosalie. There's only, what, six thousand of us as it is. 
 She makes the Mohawk people look bad. 
 But she has a Mohawk son. 
 She cost us a Mohawk son. 
 Jake was a big boy. He knew what he was doin' 
 She'll never be anything but a smuggler. 
 We've had smuggling on the Rez since Al Capone. 
 Then we'll take a vote. 
 Hi, Billy. 
 Velma, seen any smugglers tonight? 
 Come on, Billy, you never bothered with smugglers before. 
 Rosalie is worried people are gonna think the Mohawks let in terrorists. Plus, I got the Troopers on my back. They want the illegals and they say there's some white lady with them too. Is that true, Jimmy? 
 I gotta go. 
 RAY (CONT'D) No. You stay here. 
 Hi, Lila. 
 Hi Bernie. 
 You're in a lot of trouble. 
 BERNIE (CONT'D) The council voted to expel you. 
 Expel me? 
 For five years. You can appeal, but you'll never be able to change Rosalie's mind. 
 They can't do that. 
 They'll make your life miserable if you try to stay. 
 They've already done that. 
 Believe me, it could get even worse. 
 I thought this was all legal on the reservation. 
 RAY (CONT'D) (to Lila) Look, I gotta get home. 
 If she leaves, they'll turn you in Lila. The troopers want somebody. 
 But, she's a Mohawk. 
 The Chiefs want her out, so there's nothing standing between her and the troopers. 
 Listen, my kids got no one but me. 
 If you leave she won't see her son again. 
 Let her go. 
 Lila, you're giving up on him and he's only one year old. 
 (to Ray) Just go. 
 At least you got family to take care of him, ya' know? 
 He might be better off. 
 Jake wouldn't agree with that. 
 It was all for a new crib. I wanted the baby to have a pretty new crib, not some handmedown. And he wouldn't let me go alone. (laughs) I was too fat to get behind the steering wheel. 
 He wanted to keep you and little Jake safe. 
 It's just a few months, right? 
 RAY (CONT'D) I got baby stuff in the shed. 
 RAY (CONT'D) Get a good used single wide with insulation. Insulation is the key thing. Versailles will give you a hard time, but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months. Ricky's allergic to penicillin.(a moment) And you can't feed `em Pringles all the time. Okay? 
 RAY (CONT'D) Okay? 
 RAY (CONT'D) But you gotta get there quick, before the police, `cause T.J. will get scared. I don't want him to get scared, you know. 
 Okay. 
 And don't let him jerk you around. Versailles, I mean. (to Bernie) Go with her. Okay? 
 Sure. 
 Can I have more corn? 
 (shows her empty hands) Sorry, Thunder, I got nothing for you. 
 What do you want? 
 I need his coat. 
 LILA (CONT'D) Where's his coat? 
 You can't have him. 
 Say goodbye to your Dudah. 
 She's gonna kill me for taking this out of her car. 
 How long is it for me. You know if I confess? 
 As long as they're not on a watch list. Four months. 
 Will they get sent back? 
 Not necessarily. They can apply for asylum. 
 Can I have a cigarette? 
 Is there somebody I can call for you? To take care of your children. 
 I got somebody. 
 A relative. 
 A friend. 
 RAY (CONT'D) But I need to call my kid. 
 T.J. (CONT'D) -Mom are you there? What's wrong? -What kinda trouble? -What did you do? -A smuggler!? Holy shit! -Are you in jail? -But are you're going to jail!? 
 T.J. (CONT'D) -Yeah, okay. What does that mean? But why? I can take care of him, I do it all the time. But I don't see why we need-? (MORE) 
 T.J. (CONT'D) -Who? (pause) A baby? No way. -Yeah I know where the stuff is. It's in the shed, but that's so stupid!. 
 T.J. (CONT'D) (holding phone) -Yeah, I'm here. Somebody's at the door. 
 T.J. (CONT'D) -Okay. Bye. 
 T.J. (CONT'D) (to Ricky ) You're gonna have to get the little pieces up high -- or he'll eat them. 
 (O.S.) (her voice message plays) Hi, (happy) You've reached Ray. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you just as soon as I can. 
 (O.S.) (sad sack voice) Ray, are you gonna pick up or not? (MORE) 
 TROY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

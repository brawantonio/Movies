 Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the Holo-detector. 
 Not necessary, Captain. You may give it to me. 
 (not listening) You know what? I should do it myself. 
 Captain! 
 Sir, I insist you give me the plant. 
 Auto, get out of my way. 
 Sir, we cannot go home. 
 What are you talking about? Why not? 
 That is classified. Captain, give me the plant. 
 (holds plant out of reach) What do you mean, "classified"? You don't keep secrets from the Captain! 
 Give me the plant. 
 Tell me what's classified! 
 The plant. 
 Tell me, Auto! That's an order! 
 Aye-aye, sir. 
 Unsustainable? What? 
 (offended) Easier?

 SHIP'S COMPUTER Message received in the year 2110. 
 That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!! Auto, things have changed! We've got to go back! 
 Sir, orders are: "Do not return to Earth". 
 But life is sustainable now! Look at this plant, green and growing! It's living proof he was wrong. 
 Irrelevant, Captain. 
 What?! It's completely relevant! (points out to space) Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And it's in trouble! I can't just sit here and...and...do nothing! That's all I've done! That's all anyone on this blasted ship has ever done...NOTHING!! 
 On the Axiom you will survive. 
 I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE! 
 Must follow my directive.

 I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are going home today!

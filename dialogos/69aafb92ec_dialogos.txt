 (WHILE STRETCHING) I had the most amazing dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan. 
 NINA (CONT'D) Different choreography, like the Bolshoi's. It was the prologue, when Rothbart casts his spell. 
 You're in a good mood. 
 I'm just excited to get back. 
 Off-season always makes you grumpy. 
 
 (RE: GRAPEFRUIT) Look how pink. So pretty. 2A. 
 (inside joke) (inside joke) Pretty. Pretty. 
 NINA (CONT'D) Plus he promised to feature me more. 
 He certainly should. You're the most dedicated dancer in the company. 
 ERICA (CONT'D) 
 (NOTICING SOMETHING) What's that? 
 What? 
 There. 
. 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Sweet girl. 
 Can't believe she's back. 
 Of course she is. 
 She can't take a hint? Company's broke. No one comes to see her anymore. 
 1 No one comes to see ballet period. 5. 
 That's not true, I heard the Royal had one of their best seasons yet. 
 He needs to try something new. 
 No, someone new. 
 1 Like who? 
 Like someone who's not approaching menopause. 
 I think it's sad. 
 What's sad? 
 Beth's such an amazing dancer. 
 So's my grand-mother. 
 Fonteyn danced into her 50's... 
 
 (ROLLING EYES) Yeah, we know. 
 Soloists? 
 To the back, fondu, to the back, plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and fifth, to the back... (to a corps member) Like this. Push it. Why can't you do this? 
 We all know the story: virginal girl, pure and sweet, trapped in the body of a swan. She desires freedom, but only true love can break the spell. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Her wish is granted in the form of a prince. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) But before he can declare his love, her lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Devastated, the White Swan leaps off a cliff, killing herself. But, in death, finds freedom. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Good morning, company. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) We open our season with Swan Lake. Done to death, I know. But not like this. We strip it down. Make it visceral and real. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) And a new production needs a new Swan Queen. A fresh face to present to the world. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) But which of you can embody both swans? The white and the black? 
 LEROY (CONT'D) All the soloists I touched... Please go to your scheduled rehearsals this afternoon. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) And the girls I didn't touch, meet me in studio B at five. 
 What?! 9. 
 So Nina, would you like to be the Swan Queen? 
 If you want me to be. 
 Well, if I was just casting the White Swan, she'd be yours. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) But I'm not. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Maestro, Odile's Coda. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Show me your Black Swan, Nina. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Come on, not so controlled. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Seduce us! Not just the Prince, but the court, the audience, the entire world! The fouettes are like a spider spinning her web. Come on! Attack it! Attack it! 
 LEROY (CONT'D) (SARCASTIC) Good of you to join us. 
 Sorry. 
 Girls, this is Lily. Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Go on, get warmed up. 
 Should I go again? 
 (distracted by Lily) I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The White Swan's variation... 
 How did it go? 
 ERICA (CONT'D) You were late, so I called Susie in the office. An audition?! Can't believe he just sprung that on you. 
 ERICA (CONT'D) So? 
 It went okay. 
 Just okay? 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Darling? 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Shhh, shhh, tell me what happened. 14. 
 (O.S.) 
 (FROM KITCHEN) I told them it doesn't matter how talented their daughter is, if she misses any more classes, she's out. She forgets half of what I teach her, and I waste time catching her up. It's ridiculous. 
 Ow! 
 (O.S.) Everything alright? 
 I'm fine! 
 Shhh. Almost done...You're working yourself too hard. We all have off days. 
 If that girl hadn't barged in. 
 I'm sure she didn't mean to. Remember when you started? If I hadn't taken you to each of your classes, you would have been completely lost. 
 I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I finished it. 
 He knows you can do the coda. It won't convince him one way or the other. 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Oh, sweetheart, I know it's disappointing. When you start to get older, there's all this ridiculous pressure. God knows, I understand. 
 ERICA (CONT'D) But it's alright. No matter what. You'll probably get to dance the Pas de Quatre again. That's such a wonderful part. Or maybe he'll make you a Big Swan. Either way, you'll shine. 
 I know, mom. 15A. 
 Everything will be better in the morning. It always is. 
 Yes, Nina? 
 Do you have a minute? 
 If now's not a good time... 
 Now's fine, what is it? 
 I just wanted to tell you, I practiced the coda last night, and I did it. 
 How thrilling for you. 
 
 (THROWN) Well... 
 Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly don't care about your technique, you should know that by now. 
 Yes, but- 
 Anyway, I've already chosen Veronica, so... 
 (DEVASTATED) I see. 
 You're not going to try and change my mind? 
 LEROY (CONT'D) You must have thought it was possible, coming to find me like this. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Why are you here? All dolled up? 
 
 (UNSURE) I came to ask you to give me the part. 
 That all? 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Truth is, when I look at you, all I see is the White Swan. Yes, you're beautiful, fragile, fearful. Ideal casting. But the Black Swan...it's a hard fucking job to dance both. 
 I can be the Black Swan too. 
 Really? She's hungry, volatile. In four years, every time you dance, I see you obsess over getting each move exactly right, but I never see you lose yourself. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) All that discipline, for what? 
 I want to be perfect. 
 Perfection's not just about control. It's also about letting go. Surprising the audience. Surprising yourself. Transcendence. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Very few have it in them. 
 I- 18A. 
 Ow! Fuck! 
 LEROY (CONT'D) You bit me. 19. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) (AMUSED) I can't believe it. That fucking hurt. 
 (MUMBLED) Sorry. 
 (IRKED) What? 
 Veronica? 
 NINA (CONT'D) Congratulations. 
 (O.S.) Why did you tell me that? 
 VERONICA (CONT'D) Your idea of a joke? 
 (CONFUSED) What? 
 Fuck you. 
: 
 
 Hey...Everything's fine...He picked me, mommy. 
 NINA (CONT'D) Did you hear me?...Yes, I'm going to be the Swan Queen. 
 NINA (CONT'D) I'll be home soon, okay? I just had to tell you. 
. 
 Mom? 
 My daughter, the Swan Queen. 
 Oh, mom. 
 It's our favorite, vanilla with strawberry filling. 
 Just a little piece. 
 NINA (CONT'D) That's way too much. 
 It's a celebration. 
 My stomach's still in knots. 
 (OFFENDED) Fine then. 
 (GUILTY) Mom, don't. I'm sorry. 
 I'm just so proud of you. 
 It looks yummy. 
 (O.S.) Hey there... 
 DAVID (CONT'D) It is so full, where do I stand. 
 Yeah...good luck finding a spot. 
 I am David. 
 I know you are. I'm Nina. 
 Yes. Here we go, huh? 
 Okay! 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Okay, Nina. Very good. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) But I knew the White Swan wouldn't be a problem. The real work will be your metamorphosis into the Black Swan. 
 Okay. 
 I saw a flash of her yesterday. Get ready to show me more of that bite. 
 (O.S.) Watch the way she moves... 26. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Imprecise, but sensual. She's not faking it. Pay attention. 
 You share with Beth from now on, so be considerate. 
 Thanks, Susie. 
 Those are for you. From Mr. Leroy. 
 Beautiful. 
 Ready to be thrown to the wolves? We need their cash, so smile. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) As I stand here tonight, I see so many familiar faces. Your contribution to the art we all cherish profoundly goes straight to my heart and I am very grateful. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Let me begin with a very important announcement. You all have had the chance to be enchanted, transported, sometimes devastated by the performances of this true artist of our company. She has been an exceptional inspiration to my work, a role model to our dancers and a deeply satisfying presence on our stage. You all know who I am talking about...Beth Macintyre 
 LEROY (CONT'D) As we all know, every great career comes to an end. Beth is retiring at the end of the season. She will be giving her farewell performance as Melpomene, the role she originated in my first ballet. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) She will be greatly missed, but she will always be remembered. My little princess. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) But as we bid adieu to one star, we welcome another! 
 LEROY (CONT'D) As you know, we open our season with my new version of Swan Lake. Taking the role of our new Swan Queen is the exquisite Ms. Nina Sayers. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Soon you will have the pleasure of seeing her perform, tonight we raise a glass. To all of you, to Nina, to Beth, to beauty! 
 Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife, Ellen, tonight's sponsors. 
 Such a beautiful event. 29. 
 MRS. BRINSON Not as beautiful as you, dear. 
 And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Relax, you're doing great. 
 Just a second. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Hey! Look who it is. 
 LILY (CONT'D) I'm Lily, by the way. Don't think we've officially met. 
 (RATTLED) Nina. 
 Yeah... 
 NINA (CONT'D) I should probably get back. 
 Excuse me. 31. 
 (O.S.) Ah, there you are. 
 I think I drank too much. All those toasts... 
 You did well. 
 Really? 
 They tried to eat you alive, but here you are, in one piece. 
 (MELTING) I guess. 
 I'll get you a cab. Where you going? 
 Oh, Upper West Side. 
 Why don't you come to my place first? It's on the way. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) For a drink. Unless you've had enough. 
 No, that's good. 
 MRS. BRINSON (O.S.) Thomas!!! 
 (TO NINA) A minute more of ass-kissing. Wait here. 
 (CONCERNED) Hello? 
 NINA (CONT'D) Beth? What are you doing out here? 
 NINA (CONT'D) I was crushed to hear that you're leaving. 
 What'd you do to get the role? 33. 
 BETH (CONT'D) He always said you were a frigid little girl. 
 BETH (CONT'D) So what did you do to make him change his mind? Suck his cock? 
 Some of us don't need to do that. 
 You fucking little whore. 
 (GUILTY) Beth, I'm- 
 (O.S.) What's going on? 
 I need to talk to you. 
 You're drunk. You should go home. 
 Don't do that! Don't just dismiss me! 
 (EXASPERATED) Poor, poor little princess. Try to hold it together. 
 I'm going to drop by later, okay? I have something I want to give you. 
 (IGNORING HER) Come on. 
 (O.S.) A token of my appreciation. 
 BETH (CONT'D) Make the most of it Nina. 
 (O.S.) Here. 
 Thanks. 
 I thought it'd be good to talk about the role. Ground us a little. 
 Yes. 
 The better we get to know each other, the more productive we'll be. I don't want there to be any boundaries between us. 35. 
 Me neither. 
 Good. So, do you have a boyfriend? 
 No... 
 Have you had many in the past? 
 A few. But no one serious. 
 You're not a virgin, are you? 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Then there's nothing to be embarrassed about, is there? (she shakes her head) And you enjoy making love? 
 Excuse me? 
 Sex. Do you enjoy it? 
 LEROY (CONT'D) We need to be able to talk about this. 
 Okay. 
 So? 
 LEROY (CONT'D) I have a homework assignment for you. 
 Yes? 
 Go home and masturbate. Live a little. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) It's late. Lots of work tomorrow. The doorman will find you a cab. 
 Sounds like quite an evening. Wish I could have been there. 
 You know I asked. 
 I know, Susie told me. Guess he wanted you all to himself. 
 That's not why. 
 I don't blame him. 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Where did you get these? 
 They're fake. 37. 
 Fooled me. 
 I can do it. 
 Turn. 
 ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D) He must have been at your side all night, showing you off. 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Oh Nina... 
 It's just a rash. 
 What are you talking about? 
 It was worse a couple days ago. It's already getting better. 
 You've been scratching again. 
 NO- 
 I thought you'd outgrown this disgusting habit.(click) You haven't done it for years. (click) 
 Mom, please. 
 It's the role, isn't it? All this pressure... I was worried it'd be too much. 
 Don't be mad at me. You know I love you, you know I want what's best. But we have to take care of you. 
 What happened? 40. 
 She walked into the street, got hit by a car. 
 Oh my god... 
 I'm sure she did it on purpose. 
 How do you know? 
 Everything Beth ever did came from within. From some dark impulse. It's what could make her so thrilling to watch. Even perfect at times. But also destructive. 
 Was it right after we saw her? 
 It's not your problem. This has nothing to do with you. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Nina, don't let yourself be distracted. Dance is not immortalized like music, poetry or art. It lives for now. For this moment only. And this is your moment. 
 You can go in. 
 It's okay. 
. 
 What are you doing?! 
 No, no, not so stiff. Don't be scared of him. 
 Forget about control. I want to see passion. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Let it out! 
 David, answer me this question: are you interested in fucking her? 
 LEROY (CONT'D) No, of course not. No one would be. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Nina, your Black Swan still looks no different than your White Swan. She's's just as...frigid. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Fuck! 
 LEROY (CONT'D) (to someone in hall) Hey! We're still working in here. Lights back on. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Thank you! (to David, Piano Player) Okay, you guys can go. Thank you for your patience. (TO NINA) You stay. 
 Have fun. 
 I'll be the Prince. 
 Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me! 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Just feel my touch and respond. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Slow down. Open your mouth. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) 
 (INSISTENT) Open it. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) That was me seducing you. It needs to be the other way around. 
 Please don't... 
 (O.S.) Hey... 
 Who's that? 
 I'm fine. 
 We can't smoke in here. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Big day's getting closer and closer, huh? I can't wait. You're going to be amazing. 
 Thanks... 
 Just had a hard day. 
 LILY (CONT'D) He seems like a prick. 
 He's brilliant. 
 You don't know him. 
 LILY (CONT'D) It's okay. I don't blame you. 
 I should go. It's getting late. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Nina? 
 (O.S.) (CONCERNED) Nina? 
 I'll be out in a second. 
 Try it again. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Again. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Again. 
 Do you have any corrections? 
 No. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Lily talked to me. Said she saw you crying. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) She said you were upset and I should "take it easy" on you. 
 I didn't tell her that. 
 Maybe you'd like a break for a day or two. 52. 
 
- 
 Or a fucking month. 
 She shouldn't have said anything! 
 I don't care! You shouldn't be whining to her! 
 I didn't. 
 You could be brilliant. Taking it easy would be a betrayal. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 Stop saying that! Stop being so damn weak! 
 
 (RESENTFUL) Look who's gracing us with her presence... 
 Lily, I need to talk to you. 
 Now. 53. 
 (you're in trouble) Ooooh. 
 You told Thomas about last night? 
 Why would he talk to you? 
 You shouldn't have done that. 
 Has he tried anything with you? 
 ERICA (CONT'D) He has a reputation... 
 ERICA (CONT'D) I have a right to be concerned, Nina. You've been staying late so many nights. "Rehearsing." I hope he's not taking advantage, that's all. 
 He's not. 
 Good. I don't want you making the same mistake I did. 
 (INSULTED) Thanks. 
 Not like that. I just mean as far as my career was concerned. 
 What career? 
 The one I gave up to have you. 55. 
 You were 28. 
 So? 
 And only... 
 Only what? 
 Nothing. 
 What? 
 
 (DEFIANT) Nothing. 
 How's your skin? 
 It's fine. 
 We leaving it alone? 
 Yes. 
 Let me see. 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Take off your shirt. 
 No. 
 (to person outside) Can I help you? (pause) I'm sorry, she's not in. 
 Who was it? 
 It's no one. 
 Hello? 
 (SUSPICIOUS) What are you doing here? 
 LILY (CONT'D) You were right, I shouldn't have talked to him about you. 
 Sweetheart? 57. 
 Give me a second. 
 Your dinner... 
 Mom, please! 
 How did you know where I live? 
 LILY (CONT'D) Relax, I got it from Susie in the office. I feel really shitty. Can I make it up to you? Take you out to dinner? 
 I don't think- 
 Sweetie, you need to rest. 
 (TO LILY) Wait. 
 What are you doing? 58. 
 I'm going out. 
 What? 
 (TO LILY) Let's go. 
 I think it's sweet. 
 Only Beth. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Bet he'll be calling you little princes any day now. 
 I don't think so. 59. 
 (TO LILY) Cheese burger, extra bloody. 
 Let me know if it's not juicy enough. 
 Enjoy. 
 Guess I'm invisible. 
. 
 LILY (CONT'D) I always carry a spare, case I wake up somewhere unexpected. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Not like you need more attention these days. How is he? 60. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Thomas? 
 I wouldn't know. 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 LILY (CONT'D) One for you... 
 LILY (CONT'D) And one for me. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Don't worry, it's pure. Brought it with me straight from San Francisco. 
 What is it? 
 LILY (CONT'D) Oh boy. It'll just make you have a good time. Loosen up. See the night sky. 
 (CURIOUS) How long does it last? 61. 
 That's okay. 
 I'm gonna go. 
 Actually it's Andrew. 
 Tom. 
 Hi. 
 I really shouldn't, we're on the stage tomorrow. 
 Just a couple of hours? 
 LILY (CONT'D) Go on. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Let's go sit somewhere a little more comfortable. Gentlemen? 
 You haven't told me who you are. 
 Oh, I'm a dancer. 
 No, I mean your name. 
 Nina. 
 You two sisters? 
 Yes. No. 
 Well? 
 We dance in the same company. 
 (PLEASED) Ahh, ballerinas. So that's why you look alike. 
 Very funny. 
 I've never been to the ballet. 
 It's pretty boring, isn't it? 
 (OFFENDED) No, it's not. 
 (FLIRTY) It's not for everyone. You probably aren't sophisticated enough. 
 You've got some mouth, you know that? 
 You guys should come sometime. I can comp you tickets. 
 Yeah...that'd be neat. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Tom, come with me? 
 So...what are you guys working on these days? 
 Sorry. Swan Lake. 
 Yeah? 
 You know it? 
 Oh, no, not really. Heard of it though. What's it about? 
 It's about a girl who's been turned into a swan. She needs love to break the spell. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself. 
 So a happy ending, then? 
 It's beautiful, actually. 
 Like you. 
 Huh? 
 I said you're beautiful. 66. 
 ANDREW (CONT'D) That funny? 
 My hands are all sweaty. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Where you goin'? 
 Do you have any idea what time it is? 
 Mmm-hmm. Late. 
 Where have you been? 
 To the moon and back. 
 You've been drinking. 
 
 (CORRECT ANSWER) Ding ding ding. 
 What else? 
 Huh? 
 What else have you been doing? 
 You want to know their names? 69. 
 You need to sleep it off. 
 There were two. Tom and Jerry... 
 Be quiet, Nina. 
 (GIGGLING) I fucked both of them. 
 Shut your mouth! 
 Don't come in here! 
 What's this? 
 It's called privacy! I'm not fucking twelve years old anymore! 
 You're not my Nina right now! 70. 
 LEAVE ME ALONE!!! 
 Why didn't you wake me up? 
 NINA (CONT'D) I'm moving out. 
 (TO HERSELF) My music. 
 Keep going. Let's finish the Act. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) That was good. Let's take 10, then we'll move on to Act 4. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Get warmed up. 
 Thomas, I'm sor- 
 LILY (CONT'D) He wanted to go through the spacing. Asked me to step in. 
 (LOADED) I overslept. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Hello? 
 You put something in my drink. 74-76. 
 And took off this morning. 
 Yeah, you slept over. 
 But we... 
 LILY (CONT'D) What, you have some kind of lezzy wet dream? 
 You're lying. 
 Stop. 
 
 (BARKS) Shut up! 
 The Black Swan has stolen your love. There's only one way to end the pain. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) You're not at all fearful. Filled with acceptance. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) You look at the Prince, then down at Rothbart, and, yes, up at the audience...And jump! 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Go ahead. You'll be fine. 
 LEROY (O.S.) (CONT'D) Everybody get a drink then it's notes. 
 At last, I saw the Black Swan. 
 Sit still, I'm almost done. 
 COSTUMER (CONT'D) Okay, all set. 77-78B. 
 (O.S.) Yeah, need to get you measured for your Swan Queen costumes. 
 (TO COSTUMER) What's she doing here? 
 Thomas! 
 NINA (CONT'D) She's trying to replace me. 
 (to stage manager, 
) Go ahead. I'll catch up. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) What's going on? 77-78C. 
 Lily. You made her my alternate. 
 There's always an alternate, you know that. Lily's the best choice. 
 She wants my role. 
 Every dancer in the world wants your role. 
 No, she's different. She's after me. She's trying to replace me. 
 (CONDESCENDING) Nina... 
 Please believe me. 
 Listen, I know it's been a struggle. But you had a breakthrough this morning. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Tomorrow is yours. Give a great performance, and you won't have to worry about Lily, or anyone else. 
 
- 
 No more. Go home and rest. 
 What happened? 
 I gotta life, deary. 
. 
 Hey! Hey! I'm still in here. 
 NINA (CONT'D) Hey! Turn the lights back on! 
 NINA (CONT'D) Hello? 
. 
. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 NINA (CONT'D) I didn't mean to make you feel this way. It's happening to me now. She's trying to replace me. 
 You stole all these things? 
 I just wanted to be like you. Perfect. 
 I'm not perfect. I'm nothing. 
 It's not true. 
 Fucking nothing! 
 BETH (CONT'D) Nothing! Nothing!!! 
 Beth?! 
! 
 Stop it! Stop! 
 Mommy?! 
 What are you doing? 
 GO AWAY! 
 Open the door!!! 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Oh my god... 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Stop, you're sick! 
 Get OUT! 
 Sshh, shhh, it's okay. I'm here. 
 ERICA (CONT'D) You were scratching all night. 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Rest. Shhh, rest. 
 ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D) That's good. Rest. 
 Where's the clock? 
 Don't worry. 
 It's dark. What night is it? 
 NINA (CONT'D) (PANICKING) What time is it?! 
 NINA (CONT'D) I have to go. 
 Don't worry. I called the theater and told them you weren't feeling well. 
 No, I want to. 
 Lie down! 
 Get off me! 
 We're staying in here until you feel better. 
 Where is it? 
 This role is destroying you. 
 Move. 
 Nina... 
 ERICA (CONT'D) Stop it. 
 You're crazy! 
 What happened to my sweet girl? 
 She's gone. 
 Please, you're not well. 
 Let go! 87A. 
 You can't handle it! 
 I can't?! I'm the fucking swan queen! You never even got out of the corps. 
 You fucking ungrateful- 
 ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Don't leave! Nina! 88. 
 (O.S.) Nina? 
 Lily, give us a minute. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Nina? 
 LEROY (CONT'D) Nina! 
 What? 
 I already asked Lily- 
 Fuck. Have you announced it? 
 NINA (CONT'D) After Beth, do you need more controversy? 
 NINA (CONT'D) I'm here, Thomas. I'm doing it. 
 The only person standing in your way is you. It's time to let her go. Lose yourself. 
 (V.O.) Act 2's starting. Ten minutes. 
 (TO NINA) Go. 
 What are you doing? You're on! 
 What the fuck? 
 You alright? 
 That's intermission! Act 3 in fifteen. 
 It wasn't my fault. He dropped me. 
 (RAGING) What a fucking disaster! 
 Get out of here. 
 LILY (CONT'D) I'm worried about the next act. Not sure you're feeling up to it. 
 Stop. Just stop. 
 Leave me alone. Leave me alone. 
 (IN MIRROR) But it's my turn. 
 Leave me alone!!! 
 NINA (CONT'D) It's my turn. 
 (O.S.) Black Swan, places in 5.

 That's you! 
 Get back out there! Get back- 
 Great job. You got fifteen til the last act. 
 One second. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Seriously. I'm sorry things got so messed up between us. Just, holy shit, totally blown away... 100. 
 LILY (CONT'D) Anyway, wanted to tell you. I'll let you finish. Merde. 
 (V.O.) (On the PA) White Swan in 5. 
 Listen to them! They love you! Get up, get up! (MORE) 102. 
 LEROY (CONT'D) I always knew you had it in you, little princess. Go take your bow! 
 LEROY (CONT'D) What did you do? 
 I felt it. 
 Oh my god.

 Someone, get help. 
 Shhh... 
 NINA (CONT'D)

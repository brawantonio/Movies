 (V.O.) Some things, once you've loved them, become yours forever. 
 (V.O.) And if you try to let them go... 
 (V.O.) They only circle back and return to you. 
 (V.O.) They become part of who you are... 
 ...or they destroy you. 
 You can't show this to anyone. 
 Then tell the truth, Lu. 
 You weren't even there. It's your truth. It's fiction. 
 You wanted him gone too. You sent him to me. 
 LUCIEN (CONT'D) Please. You'll kill me with that. 
 Allen! No! 
 Allen!   No! DON'T...! 
 (V.O.) American daylight bombers were busy again, as our liberators with fighter escort continue the air offensive with another sock at German coastal installations in France. 
 (V.O.) But the Germans report a big new red army push toward Romania. This is World War news. 
 How was she today? 
 Fine. Anything for me? 
 Why? You expecting something? 
 No. 
 I told you it wouldn't work. 
 Mom? 
 You've got to get me out of here. He nailed the windows shut while I was in the bath. 
 Dad didn't do that. I nailed the windows. Because you're not right. 
 Shhh...Allen. He can hear you! 
 You have to rest. Clear your head. Do you want to go back to Greystone? 
 He wouldn't dare put me back there. 5. 
 Then listen to me. 
 SHHHH. He can hear you! 
 Can he still hear me? 
 What did you say? 
 Don't ever leave me. 
 Were you even going to tell me you applied?! 
 I didn't want her to know. (beat) It was a dream anyway. 
 (talking to himself, dreaming) Trilling's there. Van Doren. English Professors. Important fellows. And New York City, right in your goddamn lap. 
 Love that is hoarded, molds at last. 
 Until we know, the only thing we have-- 
 is what we give away. 
 Is what we hand away. Have, hand. Consonance. 
 Give, is. Assonance. 
 I wrote the goddamn poem. Go write your own. 
 I got in. 
 You got in?! 7. 
 I got into Columbia University! 
 You got into Columbia University?! 
 (O.S.) You don't wanna go down there. 
 Land of the fairies. Head there and you never come back. (extending a firm hand) Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia. 
 Allen Ginsberg. 
 (bright smile) You're Jewish, right? 
 I'm getting good at telling. 
 The South Hall library is a church, and these are the sacraments. 
 Original folios of the most important texts in history. Beowolf. First folio Hamlet. The Gutenberg Bible. 
 These are among the University's most prized possessions. 
 (O.S.) Let's hear a bit, shall we? 
 (reciting) On a Sunday afternoon, when the shutters are down and the proletariat possesses the street... 
 ...there are certain thoroughfares which remind one of nothing less... 
 ...than a big cancerous cock. 
 What is this nonsense? 
 Henry Miller. 
 Get down immediately. That book is restricted. 
 Which is why I committed it to memory. 
 Security! 
 Alert the press! Tell them Lucien Carr is innocent! 
 That was highly unusual. Campus is actually quite quiet. Moving on. 
 (V.O.) The Victorian sonnet has the balance of three tenets. 
 Rhyme, meter, conceit. Without this balance, a poem becomes slack, sloppy. An untucked shirt. 
 Professor Steeves, then how do you explain Whitman? 
 Say more. Two more sentences. 
 He hated rhyme and meter. The whole point was untucking your shirt. 
 What's your name? 
 Allen Ginsberg. 
 Ginsberg? Your father perhaps is the poet Louis Ginsberg? 
 He writes rhyming, metered verse. Why do you think he chose that form? 
 Because it's easier. 
 This university exists because of tradition and form. Would you rather this building be built by engineers or Whitman and his boys at play? 11. 
 There can be no creation before imitation. 
 Shut the books. We're taking my brother with us to the social. He ships out tomorrow. 
 I can't. You see how much I've got to do. 
 He's Navy. It's catnip for the skirts. 
 You hymies are really all about work, huh? 
 Brahms? 
 Finally. An oasis in this wasteland. 
 How come you're not at the social? 
 Only the most anti-social have to go to an event actually called one. Libation? 
 You drink in your room?! 
 How does a horrible bottle of Chianti sound? 
 I don't drink. 
 Freshman? 
 Yes. 
 Excellent. I love first times. I want my whole life to be composed of them. Life is only interesting if life is wide. 13. 
 To Walt Whitman, you dirty bastard. 
 How's your Yeats? Have you read A Vision? 
 Never heard of it. 
 It's completely brilliant and impossible. He says life is round: we're stuck on this wheel. Living. And dying. 
 An endless circle. Until. Someone breaks it. You came in here, you rupture the pattern. Bang: the whole world... 
 ALLEN                            LUCIEN Gets wider.                      Gets wider. 
 How did you...? 
 Consonance. Reiteration of themes. 
 Are you a writer? Because I've got a job for a writer. 
 No. I'm not. 14. 
 Well, you're not anything yet. 
 (O.S.) Ginsberg?! 
 Isn't that you? 
 (O.S.) Ginsberg?! 
 What?! 
 (O.S.) Phone call! 
 I'll be back. 
 Hello? 
 (O.S.) I found the wires. 
 He's trying to get inside my head. 
 (O.S.) Dad is not trying to get inside your head, okay? Put him on. 15. 
 He's not home. He left. 
 Where'd he go? 
 Honey, I need you come home now. 
 (O.S.) Mom I can't come home. Listen, you have to look after yourself. 
 I don't feel good. 
 (whispered, to Lucien) You're going to the dance? 
 No. Downtown. 
 (O.S.) Who are you talking to? Is he there with you?! 
 No, he's not here with me. 
 (into the phone) Listen, I'll come as soon as I can. 16. 
 You need to promise. 
 Yes. Ipromiseloveyoubye. 
 Coming? 
 Welcome to the edge of the world. 
 Allen in Wonderland. 
 Do you know her?! 
 No, and I don't plan on it. She tasted like imported sophistication and domestic cigarettes. 
 (calling out) Dave! Where's the liquor?! I'll be right back. 
 (O.S.) Hrffrff hrffrfffrfrfrrf. 
 (through the mask) You're...pinching... 
 Sorry. Are you all right? 18. 
 (long exhale) Artifacts in the visual field, some light-headedness. Motor hyperactivity. 
 What is that? 
 Nitrous oxide, for narcoanalysis. Know thyself. And beshit thyself. Ever done that? 
 Oh no, thanks. I don't do...the cannabis. 
 Show me the man both sober and happy, and I'll show you the crinkled anus of a lying asshole. 
 Allen, Willy. Willy, Allen, Lucien reefer. 
 (whispered) Is he a criminal? 
 He wishes he were a criminal. The Burroughs family is richer than God. 
 He looks like a criminal. 19. 
 He's a Harvard man, and he's going to be an amazing artist. His current medium is himself. 
 What's that? 
 Bunk for school. Now, come on, I want you to meet our host. 
 What there is, darlings and demoiselles, is a circle. Life is round. Patterns, routines, a wheel of self-abuse. Margaret, don't even deny it. 
 (whispered) Sounds like you. 
 Because it was me. First. 
 Until. The the disruption we long for, comes along and the circle is broken. 
 (whispered, to Allen) He said he was my guardian angel, but that I was too much work. 
 Take this unbloomed stalwart. 20. 
 And you are? 
 Allen. 
 Play nice, David. 
 Allen, who comes uninvited to my apartment. 
 Actually I invited him. 
 None of us notice him. Look at him. Why would we bother? 
 So the pattern of our evening, our lives, holds. But under the right circumstances, even he might change the world. 
 So you just met Lucien in the lunch line and now he's all that you can see. 21. 
 Why don't you like me? 
 Because David was in the same godforsaken line. 
 Some earjob at the bar just called me "boy." So I stole his drink. 
 That's Ogden Nash! 
 Who's Ogden Nash? 
 The best selling poet in the country. 
 "A girl who is bespectacled. She may not get her nectacled. But safety pins and bassinets--" 
 "Await the girl who fassinets." 
 And that's what he's selling?! I'll kill him. 
 Aim for the throat. 
 No. We're not going to kill him. Even better. We're going make sure nobody remembers him. (turns to Allen) How many men started the Renaissance? 22. 
 Two. 
 And the Romantics. 
 More than I suspect this theory accommodates. 
 (Five?) 
 We're sending millions to fight the Fascists in Europe, but they're here! Meter and rhyme--- 
 And Professor Steeves--- 
 Yes! They're all guards in some prison. Let's make the prisoners come out and play. Let's come up with new words, new rhythms. 
 We need a name. 
 How did they come up "Dada"? 
 Tristan Tzara jabbed a knife into a dictionary. 
 Shit. So that's been done. 
 A literary revolution without writing a word. Neat trick, Lu. 
 Well, I'm listening. 23. 
 What about Yeats? How about the "New Vision?" 
 Ginsy, you're hired! 
 BAR-GOER (O.S.) Fucking perverts. 
 "In the dawn, armed with a burning patience, we shall enter the splendid city!" 
 Shit. 
 It's Rimbaud. It's overwritten, I know. He's allowed. 
 No, my mother. This is bad. This is very bad. 
 What is? 
 She's going to be furious. 24. 
 Don't go then. 
 You don't understand. I have to. 
 What? 
 It's complicated. 
 Perfect. I love complicated. 
 Greystone will alert you if there's a change in her condition. 
 Dad, what's going on? 
 Your mother needs her rest. 
 (to his father) You can't do this to her. 
 Where were you? 
 I was out. With a friend. 25. 
 I called you! 
 It's time to go, Mrs. Ginsberg. 
 No, you're not leaving. 
 He already signed the papers. 
 Dad?! 
 It's for the best. 
 Your best. 
 It's for her best. It's not for my best. Look at her! Listen to her! 
 Get off! 
 This is your fault. 
 Complicated enough? 
 At least you have her. My father left me when I was four. 
 I've been thinking about what Yeats said. To be reborn, we have to die first. 
 So what do you suggest? 
 I've spent my life making other people happy. 
 It's time I find happiness the only way I see possible. 
 (O.S.) Oh please. Die already. 
 Where's the verve? The brio?! 
 If it be that I am indulging my self-consciousness in justifying myself, or if it be-- 
 That's a run-on. 
 Don't edit me! 
 (O.S.) The New Vision declares-- 
 (O.S.) "Proclaims" is better-- 
 Proclaims the death of morality. And... 28. 
 The expression of self. 
 The true, uninhibited, uncensored expression of the self. 
 Words, boys. Empty words. 
 Then what do you suggest? 
 The derangement of the senses. 
 (O.S.) What do you hate from the pit of your gut? 
 Institutions. 29. 
 Paterson, New Jersey. 
 My father. 
 Bingo. 
 And so while Shakespeare... 
 All right. 
 (O.S.) Extraordinary men propel society forward. It is our duty to break the law. 30. 
 Really? 
 It's how we make the world wider. 
 You are an extraordinary man. 
 Well, thank you. 
 (O.S.) "Return of the Native." "Leviathan." Tear `em up boys. Destroy the old and build the new! 
 Watch this. 
 (whispered in her ear) Go. 
 What the hell is this? 
 Time slows down as you drift deeper and deeper into your cave... 
 We are exploring the avenues of Allen's mind. 
 Dimly-lit, I am sure. What have you done to my apartment? 
 David, don't touch anything. We have to write it all down. 
 Get this man a pair of scissors! 
 This is not your revolution, this is my life. 
 What kind of life is it? 
 It's mine. Not everyone gets an allowance. (beat) Leave. Get out! 
 I need to speak to you. Alone. 
 (O.S.) It only has to be five pages. 33. 
 You make me too smart, they're gonna suspect something's up. 
 And get you sent back to your mother again? That would just be the end of you. 
 Fuck you. 
 (O.S.) Kill your darlings. 
 Your crushes, your juvenile metaphysics. None of them belong on the page. It is the first principle of good creative work. A work of fiction you will deliver as your final exam. 
 Oh look. Whitman Jr. graced us with his presence today. 34. 
 "The New Vision. Extraordinary men propel us forward. It is our duty to break the law." (to Allen) Fantastic. 
 There's more life in those five pages than in the dozens of bad sonnets we've read in class. 
 You want life? You want the world on fire? 
 The war awaits. What will it be? 
 "The rose that scents the summer air/ grows from my beloved's hair...?" 
 Keep going. That's my sonnet for Steeves. 
 We have the map. We have the manifesto. We need the work. (suddenly cold) I was wrong. Maybe you're not up for this after all. 35. 
 Show me your fucking map. 
 Stop! 
 Oh right, you don't have anything because David's not here to write it for you! 
 It's complicated. 
 I love complicated. 
 He's a professor working as a janitor so he can be near his precious Lu-Lu. He is a goddamn fruit who won't let me go. 
 A fruit? 
 A queer. 
 Then let's get rid of him. 
 Right now, I just need you to write us something beautiful. (beat) First thought, best thought. 36. 
 Allen in Wonderland. 
. 
 (O.S.) Pervitin. 
 The Germans call it the "wonder drug." Prescribed for super-human feats. 
 (O.S.) But beware of the side-effects. 
 Sudden blindness, bouts of diarrhea, heart palpitations, and a severe decline in moral standards. 
 (O.S.) Take this unbloomed stalwart. 
 (O.S.) Let the prisoners come out and play. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Writing! 
 But the words, oh the words... 
 Lu! It's very rough but... 
 Ah. The "Vision" at last. Can I see? 
 Where's Lu? 39. 
 He's out. With a senior, some football player. A writer and handsome too. (beat) James? Jack. There it is. Jack. 
 You're not allowed to be here. 
 That's odd since I'm the only thing keeping him here. 
 Not anymore. 
 Piece of advice. You don't know Lu. As soon you think you do, he'll find someone else. 
 Or maybe he already has. 
 What are you, moving in? 
 Where have you been?! 
 I found a real writer. Already a million words under his belt before Columbia. 
 You mean Jack? 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 What am I supposed to do? Newsreels? 
 What's that? 
 Nothing. 
 If you're going to stay, don't hog the blanket. 
 Why is Jack a real writer? 
 Once you meet him, you'll see what I mean. 
 (O.S.) Hey Al! 
 No. 
 (O.S.) Jack? What was that? 41. 
 (with a wink) The damn cat! 
 (whispered to Allen) She painted it. Say nothing. 
 Hey when'd this come? 
 (O.S.) Today. Where is Sammy now? 
 I dunno. Some battleship. 
 What do you think? Brilliant, no? 
 It's missing some periods and commas. 
 It's better than anything you've ever written. 
 I use periods and commas. 
 Both of you! Quiet! 
 Sammy, you bastard. 42. 
 Who's Sammy? 
 My best friend since I was twelve. Off in the Navy. 
 (O.S.) Come to the table! 
 I didn't know we were having guests. 
 What's this? 
 I was aiming for stew. 
 You missed. 
 Where are you going? 
 Out. 
 Out? I cooked all day for you. 43. 
 What do you want me to do? Eat shoe leather? I'm hungry and what you do in the kitchen is unholy. 
 That's funny. You talk like a Catholic. But you fuck me and won't marry me. How does that work? 
 Shut your mouth, Edie. 
 I thought you liked it WIDE OPEN... 
 Scram. 
 So Al. You thought my novel was shit? 
 Not exactly. It's... 
 It's all true. Jack served in the Merchant Marines. 
 I've left school twice already. Columbia's full of squares. I'm not even sure why I bothered to come back. 
 (sarcastic) Then why don't you just ship out again? 44. 
 Trust me. Sometimes when I fight with Edie, I want to. 
 You two did just fight. 
 Carr, you're goddamn crazy. 
 A "new vision?" 
 Yeah. 
 Sounds phony. Movements are cooked up by people who can't write about the people who can. 
 Lu, I don't think he gets what we're trying to do. 
 Listen to me, this whole town's full of finks on the 30th floor, writing pure chintz. Writers, real writers, gotta be in the beds. In the trenches. In all the broken places. What're your trenches, Al? 
 Allen. 
 Right. 
 First thought, best thought. 
 Fuck you. What does that even mean?! 
 Good. That's one. What else? 
 Fuck your one million words. 
 Even better. 
 You don't know me. 
 You're right. Who is you? 
 Be careful. You are not in wonderland I have heard the strange madness long growing in your soul. But you are fortunate. 
 In your ignorance In your isolation, you who have suffered Find where love hides. Give. Share. Lose. Lest we die unbloomed. 
 Allen. Beautiful, kid. 
 You wrote that? 46. 
 You asked me to. Remember? 
 Forget Columbia. Forget Ogden Nash. Here's the plan, boys. We join the Merchant Marines. Sail the world until the war ends. Then jump ship and make it to Paris. For the liberation. 
 You don't speak French. 
 Jack does. It'll be us, together. At the beginning. It'll be the perfect day. 
 Don't MOVE! 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Put your hands in the air! 
 (O.S.) You've managed to matriculate and drop out of Tulane, Bowdoin, University of Chicago. 47. 
 Your attendance record here is abominable. You've ignored curfew. Your papers, when you bother to turn them in, exceed the assigned page limit. Can you explain why you're at Columbia? 
 Same reason you're here. 
 What's that? 
 Loose Barnard girls. 
 I know about your difficulties. About what happened in Chicago. 
 (to Marion) You told him?! 
 He's not the enemy. 
 See, the University acts in loco parentis. You are our responsibility. We're trying to find someway to make this all work. 
 Who said anybody could know anything about anything?! 
 Lucien, your temper! 48. 
 (O.S.) Allen? What the hell is going on? 
 Who's she? 
 Hi. I'm Edith Cohen. 
 What's she doing here? 
 I'll go wait outside. 
 (smirks) So that's why you locked mom up. 
 Did he put you up to this? 
 No. I stole the boat. And it was tremendous. 
 Where are you going? 49. 
 You know me now. I'm only good at beginnings. 
 You're dropping out? 
 Best of luck. 
 My father shows up yesterday with some new woman. And in the middle of the Allen's-a-screw-up monologue, all of a sudden, I realize: I don't care. I've never not cared. So, I told them it was my idea. To steal the boat. 
 Why? 
 Because I don't want to be the person they think I am. I'm on academic probation. I could be kicked out. You can't leave. You started something and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next. 
 It's our turn. Let's show them what we can do. 
 You in? 
 You must not drink while you're handling it. And no writing in it. 50. 
 It must come back exactly as you found it. 
 No telling Edie, got it? 
 I see you checking out all these books. And I'm asking myself: do you ever get checked out? 
 25 seconds. Masterful. 
 Damn! Shift's over. 
 I'll go. 
 Hi. 
 I wondered if you could help me. 
 Sure. 51. 
 I'm looking for a book. 
 Okay. Does this book have a title? 
 It's called The Day Amanda Came. 
 (knowing look) Well, you'll have to wait. I can't leave the desk. 
 But...I really need it. 
 (flirting) Okay. Only for you. 
." 
 Shit! 
 Working here must be a drag. 
 I like it. It's the only way I meet boys. They're very strict at Barnard. 
 How strict? 52. 
 For example, they'd never let me do this. 
 Right. No. 
 Go! 
 Did you know I've never done it with someone who was Jewish before? I really want to know what it looks like. 
 I'm sorry, I thought you were saying something but not saying it. Should we find your book? 
 There is no book. Take it off. 
 Really? 
 (O.S.) No. Why don't you take it off? 
 It's not like I'm a virgin. I've done it with three guys already. You're a virgin, huh? 
 You're kind of a virgin, though, huh? 
 No. 
 Liar. If you have done it before, you'll last for thirty seconds. Start counting. 
 1...2... 
 3...4... 
 5...6... 
 7...8...9... 
 I knew it. 
 I bet you don't even read. 
 I do. 
 (O.S.) This is it guys. Our Bastille. No chickening out. 
 Excuse me. I think I saw some light or movement in the library. 
 (whispered) What just happened? 
 (O.S.) We know you're here! 
 What the hell, Bill? It's locked! 
 Did you hear that? 57. 
 We know you're here! 
 #2 Come on out! 
 Wait. Lucien. 
 Lu that's enough. Come on! What's wrong with you? 
 (deadly serious) No. Not yet, we have to finish. 
 Don't move. It's over. 
 Get off of me! Allen! Help! 58. 
 Open the goddamn door! Open this up! 
 The South Hall library is a church, and these are the sacraments. 
 Oh. My. God. 
 To literacy. 
 Jack, that's you, isn't it? 
 Yep. Last year. They still won. 
 Look at them! 
 Souvenir history. To make people think they left some mark on the world. Because otherwise nobody would ever know. (beat) I don't ever want to end up on this wall. 
 Have no fear. You never will. 
 What's he doing here? 
 Since you didn't show up earlier, I just hoped to give you this. 61. 
 Maybe he didn't want to see you. 
 I think he can speak for himself. 
 Yup. And he says we should all have another round... 
 You've had plenty of time to celebrate. Your library hijink made the morning paper. I'm sure you're all very proud. 
 How did you know it was us? 
 Did he use that "Bastille" line? Cause I gave it to him. 
 I haven't seen you for days. 
 You left this at my place. 
 (to David, a guess) You told the guards we were there. No one else knew. 
 You little fink! 
 You wanted me to get kicked out?! You ratted on me! 
 Stop, Lu. You're losing control again. You know what comes next. I know what comes next. 
 Yeah. (to Lucien) Cut him off. 
 Best of luck, Janitor. 
 Excuse me? 
 We are over. Leave. 
 Look at me, Lu. 
 Let's go. 
 (from his wound, breaking) You said I was everything to you. You are everything to me. Everything to me. Do you hear me? 
 Let's go. Time and place, David. 63. 
 Shut up, traitor. 
 You'd be dead if it weren't for me! 
 You'd be boring if it weren't for me! 
 And...go! 
 Jack? Jack? (no response) He broke his fucking neck. The warrior poet has passed on. 
 No, he lives! 
 Excellent! Judges award a... 
 Nine! 64. 
 All right Ginsy, your turn. 
 This is just the beginning, you know. 
 Your fault, Ginsy. It's all your fault. 
 First thought, best thought. 
 (O.S.) I think I just puked on the inside. 
 Let's go, Jack. 65. 
 Wait, Al, you coming? 
 No. Allen's got work to do. Ten pages on Spengler's Decline of the West. Due tomorrow. 
 Excuse me? 
 I'd be lost without you, Ginsy. (to Jack) Come on, Lion. 
 Fuck. Fuck! 
 Edie! Edie bird! 
 (exiting) Lu's going to use the loo. 
 Say hi to Gram. 
 We invited her over for her birthday. We made her a cake. 66. 
 Then we should have a drink! How about a drink, Grandma Frankie? You want some red wine? 
 Where the hell have you been?! 
 I was out. 
 I packed all your stuff. It's in your bag. I'm going to be at Gram's tonight. 
 Stay. I'm sorry. 
 You just say that, but it's one of your million words and they don't mean anything! (beat) Just don't be here when I come back in the morning. 
 I know this is crazy. I don't know even know what I'm doing here. But I had to tell you I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you. 
 (O.S.) Lu, where are you? 
 I'm going back to bed. Another word and I call the police. 
 What the hell?! 
 It's okay. Shhh. (turns to Lucien) 68. 
 It was David. 
 I'll wring his fucking neck. 
 I have another idea. 
 Your paper and my apology. 
 Where are you going? 
 Sailing out. To Paris. 
 We've got to make a ship, probably as merchant seamen. Jack knows the tricks. 
 You weren't going to tell me? 
 We both know why you can't come. 
 Fuck you. You're a phony. You got me and Jack and Bill making your vision come true. All because you couldn't do it yourself. 
 No, you got what you wanted. You were ordinary, just like every other freshman, and I made your life extraordinary. Go be you now, all by yourself. Leave me alone. 
 You don't really mean that. 
 (cold, deadened) Allen. Leave. 
 Allen, have you seen him? He's not in his room. 
 He left. 
 I did something wrong. Really wrong. And you have no reason to help me. But 
 But? 
 I know who you are. We're the ones he needs, but never wants. It hurts, doesn't it? 
 All I am asking is tell me where he is. Please. 
 Lemme see your papers. 
 Two seamen, reporting for duty. 
 What's your name? 
 Arthur Rimbaud. 
 Go upstairs to get on the docket. 
 Let's go get on the docket. 71. 
 Goddamn son of a bitch! 
 Let me handle this. 
 How did you know I would be here?! 
 Listen, I spoke to a guy upstairs. I got two passes. I packed for both of us. We can leave. 
 The reason I'm leaving is you. 
 Then you and Jack take them. I'll catch up. 
 Come with me. We're taking a walk. 
 Could I have a whiskey, please? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Lu? 
 This came for you today. 
 Sammy... 
 (V.O.) Jack, old chum. I'm on a hospital ship now. My guts all tore up. 
 (V.O.) Anzio's going to be the last place I ever see with my eyes. 
 (V.O.) A mortar round came and found me in my tent. 
 (V.O.) I can feel metal under my skin some places. Some went clean through. 
 (V.O.) They're not even trying to take it out no more. 
 (V.O.) The nurses gave me the same morphine I gave to dying boys... 
 (V.O.) ...when I didn't know what else to do. 
 (V.O.) Wake, melancholy mother. Wake and weep. 
 (V.O.) Quench within thy burning bed, thy fiery tears. 
 (V.O.) And let thy loud heart keep-- 
 What is that? 
 It's Shelley's elegy for Keats. 
 What's that mean? 
 It means he's dead. 
 He didn't come back here afterwards. Nobody on the floor saw. 
 We have two in custody. We're still getting names. 
 So what do we know about this Carr kid? Did we have any friends? We're gonna have to speak to all of them. 76. 
 Edie? Is Jack there? 
 (O.S.) You don't know? 
 Know what? 
 The police took him down to the Tombs. As an accessory. Bill too. 
 (O.S.) What happened? 
 Allen, thank God. 
 How could you? 
 He wanted to hurt me, I had no choice. 77. 
 You could have run. Called the police. 
 Listen. Somehow he found me at the Marine Hall. 
 He said no matter where I went, he would follow. When I confronted him, he exploded. I had to defend myself. He wouldn't stop. 
 But how did Jack and Bill get roped into this? 
 (O.S.) I went to Jack first. He told me to get rid of the knife. To forget the whole thing. 
 (O.S.) But then I went to Bill. He told me to get a lawyer. 
 (O.S.) To say it was an act of self- defense. 
 The D.A. is asking for my deposition. In writing. 
 (pleading) We both know I can't do it. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm going to be stuck in here for the rest of my life! 
 Please don't leave me here. 
 I'll do it. 
 We're going to say it was an "honor slaying". 
 (V.O.) "Related to a lethal attack committed when the accused is defending himself against a known homosexual." 79. 
 (V.O.) "If the accused is heterosexual, he shall be pardoned. But if the accused is homosexual, the charge of murder in the first degree..." 
 Dad. It's five thousand dollars for bail. I know it's a lot-- 
 JACK'S FATHER (O.S.) No Kerouac was ever wrapped up in a murder! Go to hell. 
 Would you all just SHUT THE HELL UP?! 
 You must understand David has been following him for years. 
 When Lucien went to Bowdoin, David appeared out of thin air. So I sent Lu to Chicago. 
 Surprise, David turned up there too. Then, when Lucien wanted to go to Mexico, guess who had a car idling in the driveway? 
 But he didn't have to go with him. 
 He spun a web to ensnare my son. That's why I brought him here. A lot of good that did. 
 What happened in Chicago? 
 Thank God Lu has you in his life. He talks about you all the time. 
 You know what Allen? He calls you his guardian angel. 
 That's what he called David. 
 That man ruined my son. You're going to help me keep what's left of him. 81. 
 Contrary to reports, prison is not a tonic for the spirit. 
 All the district attorney cared about was if David was queer. 
 And what did you tell them? 
 I said yes. 
 Did David do something Lu in Chicago? 
 Christ Allen, please don't get involved. 
 I have to be. I'm helping him write his defense. 
 David was my friend. But he's dead. And did Lucien tell you how he died? 
 (O.S.) He might not have wanted you to know, Allen. He tied David up. 
 (O.S.) He put stones in his pockets to weigh him down. 
 (O.S.) And dragged him into the Hudson River. 
 (O.S.) What?! 
 (O.S.) David was alive, Allen, until Lucien made him drown. 
 MR. BURROUGHS Who are you? Is he part of this business. 
 Leave him alone, Dad. 
 MR. BURROUGHS I paid your bail. Don't talk to me like that. 
 Yes, sir. 
 MR. BURROUGHS The car leaves in five minutes. 
 The libertine circle has come to an end. 
 Go back to the beginning. 
... 
: 
: 85. 
: 
 (V.O.) The perfect day. 
 He would leave me alone in the house. I was going to die there. 
 No, Mom. That's not true. 
 Yeah, I know it. 
 Mom, stop. 
 Hey, I'm okay now. I'm your mother. And I'm okay. 
 But you're not. 
 I'm in over my head. Someone I know killed a man. And I don't know what to do. He wants my help. And I don't know if I should give it to him. I don't know if it's right. It's just a mess. 
 Let him go. Don't help him. 
 I can't, mom. He's my best friend. 
 Listen to me. 
 The most important thing your father ever did was fail me. (beat) You understand? 
: 
: 
 (V.O.) He loved you. And the truth is, once-- 
: 88. 
 (V.O.) You loved him back. 
: 
 Let's get out of the city. Anywhere you want. I've saved up. 
 (V.O.) But this secret ate away at you. 
 I was just a kid, you dragged me into your perverted mess! 
 (V.O.) So in Chicago, you tried to kill yourself. 
 How can you say that? You know that's not true. 
 I will never give up on us. 
 (V.O.) He rescued you. He saved your life. 
 You're pathetic. 
 (V.O.) You needed him as much as he needed you. 
 Now I know how you felt. 
 When? 
 When you wanted to die. 
 Do it. 
 Oh my god... 
: 
 (V.O.) Some things once you love them become yours forever. 
 (V.O.) And if you try to let them go... 
 (V.O.) ...they only circle back and return to you. 
 (V.O.) They become part of who you are. 
. 
 Or they destroy you. 
 You can't show this to anyone. 
 Then tell the truth, Lu. 
 You weren't even there. It's your truth. It's fiction. 91. 
 You wanted him gone too. You sent him to me. 
 LUCIEN (CONT'D) Please. You'll kill me with that. 
 Allen! No! DON'T! 
 Allen Ginsberg. 
 He'll be with you in a minute. Please, have a seat. 
 Mr. Ginsberg. He's ready for you. 
 Mr. Ginsberg? 
 (O.S.) How did you expect us to react to this? 93. 
 No, please tell me. Professor Steeves says you submitted it as your final. 
 Well, then, let me tell you. It is smutty and absurd. 
 But you finished it. 
 You've taken incompletes in two classes. And you are already on academic probation. There are rules you agreed to upon admittance into this university. And you have managed to break and keep breaking them. You don't seem to have much respect for this institution. So you may either retract this fiction as your final. Or you may choose to be expelled. What will it be? 
 Fine. 
 Consider me expelled. 
 This remains with us. 94. 
 This came for you today. 
 (V.O.) This is Bill O'Connell reporting from Paris and these are the sounds of liberation. 
 (V.O.) Crowds have assembled in the streets. 
 (V.O.) This is the end of a long darkness. France and Europe are finally free. 
 (V.O.) Another lover hits the universe. 
 (V.O.) The circle is broken. 
 (V.O.) But with death comes rebirth. 
 (V.O.) And like all lovers and sad people 
 (V.O.) I am a poet.

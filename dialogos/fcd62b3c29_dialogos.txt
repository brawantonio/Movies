 (a murmur) Left pocket. 
 1 Our banks certainly doesn't want to discourage Harris Enterprises from investing in California. We think this is a great new venue for you but you've got to understand the mergers and acquisitions market is changing. With the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the risk. 
 Look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation. We have over a thousand man hours in this deal. 
 (losing patience) This is a "no brainer".  There's no risk for you.  No one has ever lost money backing Mr. Harris. 
 2 Not yet.  But ship building is a new endeavor for you... 
 (cuts him off) Come on.  You know we're not going to go into ship building. Besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us! 
 3 Bill, be reasonable.  If you're really going to digest Kross Industries that quickly eighteen should not be such a problem. Besides, I don't think there's anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have. 
 It's unacceptable. 
 Draymen Heux has offered me seventy-five in the pool at sixteen and a half.  I can secure the other half personally.  You have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer. 
 The meeting is over, gentlemen. 
 Hah!  Did you see the look on their faces? 
 You don't think we pushed too hard? 
 NO way!  They'll come back.  They can't afford not to.  Edward, that bluff was beautiful. 
 Maybe I should have made it rhyme. 
 (looking at his watch) Well!  It's late.  We've been at this long enough. 
 Gentlemen, enjoy the party.  The magician's wonderful. 
 (calling after them) Watch your left pocket. 
 Phone call, Mr. Harris.  It's Miss Charles. 
 Cynthia?  Is she coming out? 
 We're about to find out.  Go on. Take care of your guests. 
 (into phone) Where are you, Cynthia? (beat) I see. (pausing, getting angry) No, I don't expect you to be at my beck-and-call.  Are you coming or not? 
 (all business) Prepare the filing papers.  Have them ready by the middle of the week.  I'll tell you when to submit them. 
 A Edward! 
 (turning on the charm) Yes! 
 Wouldn't miss it. (abruptly; to Vance) I want this done fast and easy. No slip-ups.  I want to be back in New York by Saturday.  Got it? 
 Bill? 
 (flustered) Oh... Hi, honey... Millicent, uh, uh, Millicent. 
 Lowell. 
 Lowell, right.  My wife, Elizabeth. 
 (ignoring her) Is Edward leaving? 
 What's up, where you going? 
 Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel. 
 At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you. 
 Apologize to Elizabeth for me. 
 Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you... 
 (as if delighted) Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do? (turning away) No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one. 
 Cynthia's not coming? 
 No. 
 Let your driver take you.  We'll move the cars... 
 Can you drive a stick? 
 Edward, give me a break! 
 Love this car!  Is it new? 
 Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going! 
 That's the wrong way! 
 Vivian. 
 Rent.  You're late. 
 Kit give me nothin'. 
 Of rent I do not bullshit. 
 By the end of the week or you're otta here. (a beat) By the way, you look very nice tonight! 
 Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date? 
 1 Hi, hi!  No see nothing. 
 2 Looking good, bay-bee. 
 They just pulled her out of a dumpster in the back.  Now talk to me. 
 I tell you, man, I don't know who she hang with. 
 She have a pimp? 
 Cocaine her pimp, man.  She a strawberry.  She be out on these streets, day in, day out, tradin' her sorry ass for crack.  And now she dead from it. 
 Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv. 
 Lookin' good, baby. 
 Carlos had some great rock. 
 Calm down, Chica. 
 Ey!  What is it you wan', baby? I can fix you up. 
 You kiss your mother with that mouth?  Your frien' still owes me 200. 
 (threatening to Vivian) Don't take no dates tonight, chica, you got one with me. 
 Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores. 
 Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise. 
 I will.  I'm trying. (a beat) Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high? 
 Okay. (then touches her hand) I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid. 
 No no, honey.  You see these stars on the sidewalk.  Me and Vivian work from Don Ameche all the way up to Roy Rogers. This is our office.  We got seniority.  Get off our corner. 
 I was just taking a rest here. Besides, she's new. (points to Vivian) 
 But I'm old.  Go rest up by Monty Hall or Debra Paget where you belong. 
 Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and -- 
 I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home. 
 (O.S.) (suddenly) Hey, hey -- There's a rent. 
 (calls out to Vivian) Excuse me. 
 (excited) Don't take less than a hundred. You look hot tonight.  And remember, don't mouth off.  They don't like that. 
 You're the greatest.  I'll wait up for you. 
 What's that? 
 Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills? 
 Yes. 
 (a beat) No, you look like a hooker. 
 Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills? 
 That's ridiculous. 
 Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart? 
 Sit-and-spin. (amused) Alright... why not? 
 (holding up a bill) You have change for a twenty. 
 (as he grinds the gears; wincing) No. 
 Not exactly. 
 If you can figure it out, be my guest. 
 Very good.  You're obviously mechanical. 
 New York. 
 Hotel. 
 Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it. 
 What's your name? 
 You like being a hooker, Vivian? 
 So do day jobs. 
 Must be dangerous.  Hooking. 
 Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card. 
 Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to. 
 Ugly habit, biting your nails. 
 What do you charge for company, Vivian? 
 For the whole night? 
 You're joking. 
 Neither do I. (a moment; amused) A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff. 
 Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night? 
 Try me. 
 Fine. 
 Edward.  My name is Edward. 
 Get in.  This side. 
 You know how to drive a stick? 
 Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive. 
 My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on. 
 You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour. 
 Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're... 
 Exactly. 
 Evening, sir. 
 Good evening.  Penthouse. 
 (into the phone) Room service. (to Vivian) What do you drink? 
 (into the phone) Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne. 
 (into the phone) -- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you. 
 (to Vivian) Impressed? 
 Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this. 
 (a small smile) Always. 
 Fair enough. 
 Let's talk some more first. 
 (taking off his jacket) Uh-huh. 
 (loosening his tie) And why do you say that? 
 Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers. 
 Champagne. 
 Where would you like it? 
 Where would we like it?  Here'll be fine. 
 I think he wanted you to tip him. 
 I have both. 
 They should be.  They're both good at it. 
 It's a very good year. 
 Try a strawberry. 
 Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne. 
 Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate. 
 (softly) You really are a very beautiful girl. 
 Yes... 
 (touching her breasts) What do you like? 
 (O.S.) It's open. 
 (into the phone) Sorry.  Go ahead. 
 Kross knows we're after his company.  He wants to talk with you.  I don't think you should. 
 I want to. 
 Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal. 
 I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it. 
 You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him. 
 Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car... 
 Oh, god, what? 
 (smiling) I'll bring it back. 
 Good morning. 
 No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast? 
 Did you sleep well? 
 Occupational hazard? 
 I took the couch.  I had some work to do. (hesitating) About last night... 
 Mmm, I could tell. 
 I'd say you give a good dollar value. 
 Do you ever... enjoy it? 
 No?  Why's that? 
 I buy companies. 
 The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million. 
 (fumbling with the tie) I sell them. 
 By breaking up a company's assets -- 
 Vivian -- 
 Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit. 
 Not... quite. 
 Where'd you learn to do this? 
 Don't drown. 
 (into the phone) Yes. 
 Edward, it's me.  Kross is all set for tonight. 
 Listen, I gotta say this again, I don't like you going alone. 
 (stifling a chuckle) I'm a big boy. 
 Let me at least get you a date. Keep it social. 
 Edward, did you hear me? 
 I'm here. 
 I know a lot of nice girls. 
 I have one. 
 All right.  How much for the week? 
 I'm in town until Saturday. 
 Do-you-want-to-stay-here- for-the-week? 
 Of course.  How much? 
 Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500. 
 All right, two thousand. 
 Done. 
 I'm not just talking about sex. 
 Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go. 
 I'll be out most of the day. 
 I want you to go out and buy some decent clothes. 
 Nothing too flashy, not too sexy. Conservative.  Understand? 
 Think again.  I'm taking you out to an important dinner with me tonight. 
 Probably. 
 (O.S.) 'Lo. 
 (O.S.) I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay? 
 (O.S.) Why'd he want you? 
 (O.S.) I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back. (a beat) Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'? 
 I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye. 
 (O.S.) (brightening) In Beverly Hills? 
 (O.S.) Baby!  Rodeo Drive. 
 (cooly) May I help you? 
 Are you looking for something in particular? 
 Yes... 
 I don't think it would fit you. 
 It's very expensive. 
 (unblinking) Excuse me? 
 I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place. 
 MR. THOMAS May I help you Miss? 
 MR. THOMAS You're a guest here? 
 MR. THOMAS And who is that? 
 MR. THOMAS Do you know this young lady? 
 She's with Mr. Harris. 
 MR. THOMAS (surprised) Mr. Harris? 
 She apparently joined him last night. 
 MR. THOMAS Why don't you come with me.  We'll chat for just a moment. 
 MR. THOMAS What's your name? 
 MR. THOMAS Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. 
 MR. THOMAS Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again. 
 MR. THOMAS (into the phone) Women's clothing. (beat) Bridget, please. 
 Okay... this is the jewel in Kross's crown.  We can strip out all the heavy equipment.  Some of the cranes are very valuable overseas.  The Japanese are salivating for them. 
 Prime industrial property straddling the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  It gives me a hard-on. 
 What's that long building over there? 
 Storage, I think. 
 Not with those smokestacks it's not. 
 Let me check. 
 The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said -- 
 You what? 
 I talked to some developers about the land. 
 What kind of an idiot are you? You don't talk about this to anyone. 
 They're close friends, they'd never breathe a word -- 
 (to Vance) Where did you dig this moron up? 
 He's right, Jake, that was an incredibly stupid thing to do. It won't happen again, Edward. I'll pull him off the project immediately. 
 Don't bother. 
 What!? 
 We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides... (not unkindly, to Jake) You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you? 
 It won't happen again, Mr. Harris. 
 This is interesting.  That building is storage now, but it used to be a smelting plant.  They closed it down after World War 
. 
 I want our lawyers to check into the toxic waste licences on them right away.  I want to know if the permits are still valid and what kind of limits are on them. 
 Jesus, yes.  It's a long shot but if the permits are still in effect, they're worth a fortune. 
 What time's diner tonight? 
 Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking? 
 No one you know. 
 You must be Vivian. 
 No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are horrid, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town? 
 You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes? 
 (calling out) Philip!  We'll need shoes! 
 Your uncle will like this. 
 They never are, dear. 
 MR. THOMAS (dryly) I rather hoped you'd be wearing it. 
 MR. THOMAS That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely. 
 MR. THOMAS You're very welcome, Miss Vivian. 
 Never answer the phone.  Ever. 
 Did you buy some clothes? 
 Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate. 
 Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it? 
 This isn't a date. 
 The Rex. 
 I think you'll approve. 
 Thank you very much. 
 I thought I told you not to answer the phone. 
 Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed. 
 Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed. 
 I also place las chocolates on the pillow. 
 I leave extras, miss. 
 MR. THOMAS What is it, Miss Vivian? 
 MR. THOMAS It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say. 
 MR. THOMAS I think you'll find it normal enough. 
 MR. THOMAS You'll like it fine. 
 MR. THOMAS Just mind which fork you use. 
 MR. THOMAS In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand. 
 MR. THOMAS Either you're European or badly brought up. 
 MR. THOMAS Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork. 
 MR. THOMAS They will serve salad. 
 MR. THOMAS Then you use your soup spoon. 
 MR. THOMAS (picking up the appropriate utensil) Then you would use your-- 
 MR. THOMAS Miss Vivian -- 
 MR. THOMAS Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead? 
 I hate him already. (a beat) All set? 
 Darling?  Trust me. 
 MR. THOMAS Good evening, Mr. Harris. 
 MR. THOMAS Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel. 
 Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment -- 
 MR. THOMAS I have a message for you from your "niece", sir. 
 My what? 
 MR. THOMAS The young lady staying in your room? 
 I think we both know she's not my niece. 
 MR. THOMAS Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge. 
 Thank you. 
 MR. THOMAS Very intriguing young woman, Miss Vivian. 
 I'm sorry. 
 So young man, I understand you are trying to take over my company. 
 Please don't patronize me, Mr. Kross.  Our ages mean nothing here. 
 Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share. 
 Twenty-five percent. 
 Mr. Harris, I built Kross Enterprises myself.  I know every man who ever worked there by his first name.  I know their wives... and their children.  If your intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal, think again. 
 What do you suggest, Mr. Kross? 
 What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price. 
 To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything. 
 We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note... 
 You're not getting any navy contracts. 
 There's no way you could know that. 
 But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will... (looking up) Ah, the escargot. 
 (bending to whisper) Escargot, mademoiselle. 
 (leaning close to whisper) Snails. 
 Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours. 
 (angry) You've got a lot of nerve. 
 No.  What I have is a lot of money. 
 I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks. 
 (calmly) What I did with those companies was perfectly legal. 
 I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you. 
 (angry now) It is not your company.  It's a public company.  And I am going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you. 
 If you'll excuse me young lady, Mr. Harris... (turns to David) Deal with this, David, you know where we stand.  I need to go someplace and puke. 
 (to Edward and Vivian) Men like my father built this country.  He was no saint.  He screwed people.  But for every guy he stepped on, he gave a hundred a good job. 
 We can reach an understanding on this. 
 I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have. 
 Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally. 
 I do.  I take it all very personally. (to Vivian) Very nice meeting you, Vivian. 
 (a beat) And that's the way the game is played. 
 Are we ready for the next course, sir? 
 No.  Bring a check, please. 
 Thank you. 
 Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business. 
 Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive. 
 That... is very good. 
 Television? 
 I have work to do. 
 (O.S.) Wake up, Vivian.  Time to shop. 
 I still don't understand why you only bought one dress. 
 Why not? 
 Was someone rude to you? 
 Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you. 
 Good. 
 (uncomfortable under Vivian's stare) Do... do you have a charge account with us? 
 Kross came out of his corner swinging.  He started buying up all available stock as soon as the market opened. 
 (almost to himself) He's a tough old son of a bitch... 
 It's up to ten and a quarter. 
 Offer nine and a half.  Bring them back down to earth. 
 Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight? 
 Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away. 
 Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry. 
 (to Vance & Stuckey) Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise. 
 (surprised) We're letting them slide? 
 I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now. 
 But, Edward... 
 Do it. 
 (looks at his watch) You're on your own now, Vivian. I've got to get to work.  Be sensible and you can keep everything.  Spend too much and it all goes back. 
 (to the customer) Isn't this lovely?  I think it would look wonderful on you. 
 (to her customer) Would you like to try it on? 
 Yes? 
 No, I'm sorry, I don't. 
 (gloating) You were right.  Kross mortgaged everything he has down to his grandson's college tuition to secure loans from a bank.  Not just any bank.  One we do business with. 
 Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars -- 
 Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money. 
 And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed. 
 Get the bank on the phone for me. 
 Thank you.  I would. (he fingers her dressing gown) Nice. 
 Please. 
 Dinner can wait. 
 No. 
 Easier than learning how to be poor. (a moment; and then:) My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him. 
 Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it. (and then; growing very quiet) My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him. 
 He died a long time ago. 
 (O.S.) Miss Vivian? 
 You have a call.  Mr. Harris. 
 I think it's exciting. 
 I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard. 
 (O.S.) Edward! 
 (looking at Vivian) Well, well, well... 
 Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian. 
 (holding out a hand; smiling) Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth. 
 Lots of fun people here.  Let me get you two some champagne. 
 Excuse me. 
 He's good at what he does. 
 (a small smile) Shall we mingle? 
 I simply love your dress, Vivian. 
 Of course, a figure like yours can wear anything.  You must work out constantly. 
 Are you into running, Vivian? 
 You look awfully familiar, Vivian. Haven't we run into one another at the spa in La Costa? 
 Edward, she's marvelous.  Warm and witty and down to earth. 
 (with pleasure) She is, isn't she. 
 So unlike your usuals.  Where on earth did you find her? 
 A We're good together.  He has to admit it.  I've been just what he wants me to be.  I say the right things, I know the right people, I give wonderful parties. No question, no arguments, no embarrassments.  It works for both of us. 
 I'm sure that's true for some of them. 
 (a beat) Ready to stomp sod? 
 Hi. 
 (laughs) I like your hat. 
 Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder. 
 Thunder's a horse.  Come on. 
 Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian. (a beat; and then:) You two been together long?  You and Edward? 
 Hope to be? 
 I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then. 
 I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch. 
 Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet? 
 We just did. 
 (grinning) Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this. 
 The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions. 
 And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work? 
 Yes... 
 Doing what? 
 Vivian's in sales. 
 Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell? 
 Why do you want to know? 
 Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross. 
 She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie. 
 So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient. 
 You're being ridiculous. 
 Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information? 
 Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard. 
 I swear to God, you are the only millionaire I ever heard of who'd go looking for a goddam bargain streetwalker! 
 Let's drop it, shall we? 
 Edward!  May we have your opinion on something? 
 (to Vivian and Stuckey) Excuse me a moment. 
 Having a good time, Vivian? 
 All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard. 
 It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me. 
 I just might do that. 
 You're awfully quiet.  You haven't said a word since the party. 
 Vivian, what the -- 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened. 
 What was I supposed to do? (a beat) I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent. 
 Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down? 
 Vivian... 
 Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you. 
 I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up. 
 Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you. 
 I really am sorry. 
 I'll make it up to you. 
 This is no time to disappear. We're in too far. 
 Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow. 
 Promise me you'll read those contracts by then. 
 Goodbye, Bill. 
 Shit... By tomorrow, Edward! 
 MR. THOMAS Good afternoon, Mr. Harris. 
 Afternoon. 
 (a small smile) Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing. 
 I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however... 
 This is made for a princess. I think she'd approve of you wearing it tonight.  There. Come look. 
 Shush.  Of course you can. 
 You won't. 
 I'll guard them and you with my life. 
 Your plane is ready to go, Mr. Harris. 
 Very good. 
 You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't. 
 To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker... 
 The opera. 
 I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these. 
 Vivian, what do you think you're doing? 
 Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you. (a beat) Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone? 
 What happened to him? 
 Some people say that opera is an acquired taste, but I don't believe it.  You can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time.  They either love it or hate it.  Those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might come to appreciate it, but they'll never truly love it. 
 Viv?  I really doubt if anyone here is going to try and grab it. 
 They all think you look very beautiful, Vivian. 
 I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words. 
 Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it. 
 What am I?  I am a poet.  Not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams.  You have come to replace my vanished dreams.  I dwell now only in your eyes. 
 And now she asks Rudolpho if he still thinks her beautiful -- 
 Did you enjoy the opera, dear? 
 If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you. 
 I know.  I'm glad. 
 Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you. 
 Yes? 
 Did I wake you? 
 I'm up. 
 I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today. 
 Why? 
 He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and we got him. (silence) You there? 
 Give me twenty minutes. 
 We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning. 
 Better get dressed.  We're having guests. 
 (quietly) One more night and you're finally rid of me. 
 I have to go to New York tomorrow. 
 It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that? 
 Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution. 
 Vivian, life's not a fairy tale. 
 I've never treated you like a whore. 
 Mr. Harris. 
 How are you, Mr. Kross. 
 Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it. 
 Young lady. 
 Hello, Vivian. 
 Let's not waste time here, shall we?  Mr. Kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with Mr. Harris.  Mr. Harris is now listening. 
 Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer. 
 Expected... offer. 
 Of course, yes.  After the expected filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid. 
 (a moment) You're making the right decision, sir. 
 I'll see you on one condition. I'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me... 
 (quickly) They'll be taken care of.  Won't they, Edward? 
 I'll sign anything you want then. 
 Today. 
 Today. 
 Excuse me, please? 
 What do you mean? 
 Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated. 
 It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all. 
 Yes.  The man made a business decision. 
 It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money. 
 I'll be back in a few hours. We'll talk about this later. 
 We'll continue this down at the office. 
 MR. THOMAS Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you. 
 MR. THOMAS I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own. 
 Viv?  Where are you, babe? (glaring at Mr. Thomas) The sphincter-police won't let me through. 
 Was that you? 
 Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks... 
 Yeah.  I just got it. 
 Fifty bucks, grampa.  For seventy-five, the wife can watch. 
 Everybody keeps starin' at me. 
 What do you know?  You look good. All dressed up. (meaning it) You clean up real nice. (giggling) You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway. 
 Where do you fit? 
 Honey, you're not supposed to do that. 
 Oh, my god, you mean it was good? 
 Dummy. 
 I pray for that. 
 Go for the bucks. 
 Wow, are you in deep shit. (a sigh) You know he'll break your heart. 
 Congratulations, sir. 
 What? 
 Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won. 
 Who are you going after next, sir? 
 Who indeed... 
 If we can get these letters of intent out of the way now... Mr. Harris and I would like to ask you some questions about your company. 
 Dad, excuse me, but that's inappropriate.  You're under no obligation to answer any questions at all. 
 Could we at least wait till after the filing period? 
 Mr. Harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth.  The price he ultimately pays for your father's stock will be based on that bid.  The more we know, the higher our bid can be. 
 It's in my best interest to cooperate, David. 
 If he throws himself on your sword, you promise to take care of him and his family, huh? 
 That's unfair! 
 You bed it is. (to Edward) You're everything he said you were. (to his father) Do what you have to do, Dad. Just don't expect me to watch it. 
 He's young.  He hasn't learned how to lose gracefully yet.  I'll sign your papers.  And I'll answer your questions.  Whatever you want. 
 Stop.  For just a moment. (a moment) Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct? 
 Yes. 
 If you had a... reprieve, what would do? 
 (quickly) I don't think there's any sense in -- 
 Let him answer. 
 I... I would take advantage of it. 
 How? 
 I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time... 
 I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that. 
 Oh, my god... Edward, no! 
 I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you? 
 Have you lost your mind? 
 (to Stuckey) Quiet. (to Edward) Would I get the loans? 
 This time I imagine you would, yes. (as if thinking about it) Hmm... (a moment) With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I? 
 (a small smile) You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris. 
 You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home. 
 What!? 
 Have a good day, gentlemen. 
 (calls) Edward, what happened?  What kind of move was that? 
 (yells) Dammit Edward, speak to me. 
 No... take the car back to the hotel.  I need to walk. 
 Well, well... Hello again.  I'm looking for Edward. 
 No, I'll just have to wait then, won't I? 
 Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why? (pours another drink) What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities. 
 I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal. 
 But what do I know, maybe you're worth it.  Come on, show me. Let's see your act. 
 Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  Are you a fifty dollar whore? 
 You got a mean streak in you, don't you. 
 You broke my nose. 
 I think I broke my hand. (a beat) You're fired. 
 Edward, we've been together ten years. 
 And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole! 
 All this because of that whore! 
 Yes. 
 Edward, think about what you're -- 
 (to himself, almost proud) Well, I didn't plan that! 
 Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore. 
 It was a business decision. 
 I got tired of hating my father. 
 It felt good. 
 You're packing. 
 Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to. 
 Vivian... 
 Let me take those, miss. 
 MR. THOMAS (looking up) Miss Vivian. 
 MR. THOMAS Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow. 
 MR. THOMAS You're not accompanying him to New York? 
 MR. THOMAS Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian. (turning to the desk clerk) John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel. (turning back to Vivian) See you again sometime soon. 
 You're sure this is the right street, ma'am? 
 Maybe I should go with you.  This doesn't look like a good place for a lady to be alone. 
 Hey, we announce guests here. You a relative of somebody? 
 You lookin' good, Viv'.  Nice threads.  I gotta find time to shop. 
 Is that everything, sir? 
 (turning from the window) That's everything. 
 The lady, she go? 
 Yes.  She go. 
 Do you have a car taking you to the airport, sir? 
 Yes. 
 So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco? 
 What kind of school? 
 So did I.  I made it with the principal. (recites) Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see. 
 Do I!?  Momma! 
 And leave all this?  Not in a million. 
 Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy. 
 No.  You took care of rent, that's enough. 
 I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day. 
 Coffee, Chan.  And maybe a grilled cheese on white, okay? 
 Hey, how you doin'.  You new, huh? 
 Yeah.  Got a cigarette? 
 Sure. 
 Jeez, did the wacko in the suit. 
 Chan?  Keep the sandwich warm, I'll be back. 
 I'm looking for a girl, Vivian, young, dark hair, big eyes...? 
 She's mouthy.  Sort of difficult...? 
 1 Ain't seen her, wouldn't know her. 
 2 What's wrong with us, man?  Two for the price a one, what ya say? 
 (disappointed) Thank you.  No. 
 (O.S.)

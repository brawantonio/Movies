 
 Will...! 
 Why is this happening? 
 I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding. 
 On what charges? 
 *What are the charges?* 
 We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with. 
 *Captain* Jack Sparrow. 
 
 Fifteen men on a dead man's chest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
 
 Sorry, mate. 
 Mind if we make a little side trip? I didn't think so. 
 
 Not *quite* according to plan. 
 Complications arose, ensued, were overcome. 
 You got what you went in for, then? 
 Mm-hmm! 
 Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it. 
 And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic. 
 And the hurricane! 
 Aye. 
 All in all, it's seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating. 
 Shiny? 
 Aye, shiny. 
 Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain? 
 COTTON'S PARROT Awk! Walk the plank! 
 What did the bird say? 
 Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on that piece of cloth there. 
 Ohhh! 
 Know that don't do no good. 
 It does me. 
 It's a key! 
 No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key. 
 Gentlemen, what do keys do? 
 Keys... unlock... *things*? 
 And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there's something valuable. So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks! 
 No! If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it? 
 So - We're going after this key! 
 You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions? 
 So... Do we have a heading? 
 Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... a general... in *that* way - direction. 
 Cap'n? 
 Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Come on, ?oy/?quick, ?oy/?quick, hey! 
 Have you noticed lately... The captain seems to be actin' a bit strange... -er. 
 Settin' sail without knowing his own headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed. Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all. 
 Lord Beckett. The prisoner as ordered, Sir. 
 
 Why is the rum always gone? 
 Oh! *That's* why. 
 As you were, gents. 
 Ah! 
 Bootstrap. Bill Turner. 
 Is this a dream? 
 I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum. 
 I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way. 
 Your son. 
 And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle? 
 Who? 
 Ah. So it's you, then.  He shanghaied you into service, eh? 
 It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment - 
 Technic - 
 Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already *has* a captain, so there's re - 
 Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie? 
 On deck all hands! Make fast the bunt gasket! On deck! Scurry! ?Scurry-on/?Marty, I want movement! 
 *I want movement!* 
 Lift the skin up! 
 All on deck! Run! And keep running! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us! 
 Do we have a heading? 
 Ah! Ooh! Run! Land. 
 Oh! Euh! 
 Which port? 
 Didn't say port. I said land. Any land. 
 Agh! 
 Jack's hat! Bring 'er about! 
 No no! Leave it! Run! 
 Back to your stations! The lot o' ya! 
 Jack? 
 Shhh! 
 For the love of mother and child, Jack, what's coming after us? 
 Nothing.

 Mister Swann, - 
 Jack's Compass. What does Beckett want with that? 
 I have faith in you. Both of you. Where will you find him? 
 Properly? 
 If it weren't for these bars I'd have you already. 
 I'll wait for you. 
 *Captain* Jack Sparrow? Owes me four dubloons. Heard he was dead. 
 Jack Sparrow! 
 I haven't seen 'im in a month. 
 When you find him, will you give him a message? 
 Cannot say about Jack Sparrow. But dere's a island, just south of de straits, where I trade spice for... mmm... delicious long pork. Cannot say about Jack. But you find a ship dere. A ship wit' black sails.

 No! Will has gone to find Jack! 
 He's a better man than you give him credit for. 
 A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging. 
 Evening, Governor.  Shame, huh? He was carryin' this. It's a letter to the King. It's from *you*. 
 Where is she? 
 EITC headquarters 
 Then what is? 
 I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate. 
 These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King? 
 Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good. 
 I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know. 
 Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night. 
 These aren't going to Jack. 
 Well I say it was divine providence what escaped us from jail. 
 And I say... it was me bein' *clever*. Ain't that right, poochie?

 It ain't stealin'. It's *salvagin'*! And since when did you care? 
 Since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

 It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

 Amen to that.

 Thank you.

 Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief. But he only remains chief as long as he *acts* like a chief. 
 Worse... as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a *god* in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison. 
 ?Argh! They'll roast him and eat him. 
 These cages we're in... weren't built 'til *after* we got here.

 ...Captain Jack... Sparrow. 
 Let's put some distance between us and this island, and head out to open sea. 
 Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible. 
 Uh, that seems a bit contradictory, Captain. 
 I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now where is that monkey? I want to shoot *something*. 
 Ah. 
 Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on 'er? Maybe just lock her up somewhere. 
 There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes. 
 Mister Gibbs! 
 Cap'n. 
 We have a need to travel upriver. 
 By need, d'you mean a... trifling need, ?uh/?a... fleeting, as in say in a passing fancy? 
 No, a... resolute and unyielding need. 
 William... I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find *this*. 
 No. *You* want you to find this. Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your ?dolly/?dotty belle ol'... what's-her-face. Savvy? 
 How much do you know about Davy Jones? 
 Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth. 
 What's all this? If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share, and wear it one after the other. 
 It's not like that, Sir. This ship is haunted. 
 Is it now? 'N' you? 
 The... female presence... amongst us, yes... all the men... they can feel it. 
 I say... that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it. 
 No! That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back! 
 Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you. Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh... she's probably naked. 
 Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off. And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness. The Kraken! 
 They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If you believe such things. 
 Now that's the very question Jack wants answered. Bad enough even to go visit... *Her*. 
 Aye. 
 Tia's shack 
 No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been. Before. 
 I'll watch your back. 
 It's me front I'm worried about. Mind the boat. 
 Mind the boat. 
 Mind the boat. 
 Mind the boat. 
 COTTON'S PARROT Awk! Mind the boat! 
 Jack Sparrow! 
 Tia Dalma! 
 I always know de wind was goin' blow you back to me one day. 
 You. You have a touch of... destiny about *you*, William Turner. 
 You want to know *me*. 
 There'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it. 
 I thought *I* knew you. 
 Not so well as I had hoped. Come. 
 Come. 
 What... service... may I do you? Hmmm? You know I demand payment. 
 I brought payment. 
 Look! 
 An undead monkey! Top that! 
 No! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that. 
 The payment is fair. 
 We're looking for this.  And what it goes to. 
 The Compass you bartered from me. It cannot lead you to dis? 
 Maybe. Why? 
 Ayeee... Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants! Or... do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. Your key go to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it? 
 What *is* inside? 
 Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature? 
 Nothing... bad, I hope. 
 You know of... Davy Jones, yes? A man of de sea. A great sailor, until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men. 
 What, indeed. 
 The sea? 
 Sums! 
 Dichotomy of good and evil. 
 A *woman*. 
 A wo-*man*. He fell in love. 
 No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with. 
 Same story, different versions, and all are true. See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die. 
 Him heart. 
 Literally, or figuratively? 
 He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest!  Could he? 
 It was not wort' feeling what... small fleeting joy life brings, and so... he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all times. 
 I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey! 
 Let me see your hand. 
 Uhhh! The black spot! 
 My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know. 
 I am justMy little ###, where are you? ### 
 Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years. Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow. And so you will carry land wid you... 
 Dirt. This is a jar of dirt. 
 Yes? 
 Is the... jar of dirt going to help? 
 If you don' want it, give it back. 
 No. 
 Den it helps. 
 A touch... of destiny! 
 Neither do you. Do *not* underestimate her. 
 Must've run afoul of the reef. 
 So what's your plan, then? 
 And if there are crewmen? 
 I like it. Simple, easy to remember. 
 Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-ha! 
 Hey! If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt! Might save your life!

 Five men still alive. The rest have moved on. 
 Do you fear death?  Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished.  I can offer you... an escape-uh. 
 Don't listen to him! 
 Do you not fear death? 
 I'll take my chances, Sir. 
 To the depths. 
 Life is cruel.  Why should the afterlife be any *different*? I offer you a choice. Join my crew, and postpone the judgment. One hundred years before the mast. Will ye serve? 
 I - I will, serve. 
 ?Grand. 
 *You* are neither dead nor dying. What is your purpose here? 
 What is your purpose here? 
 Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer. 
 Oh. 
 You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. *That* was our agreement. 
 Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon. 
 Then you were a poor captain, but a *captain* nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as *Captain* Jack Sparrow? 
 You have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there. 
 One soul is not equal to another. 
 Aha! So we've established my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price. 
 Price? Pttt! 
 Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth? 
 One hundred souls, three days-uh. 
 You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off. 
 I keep the boy. A good-faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! 
 Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed.  Dividing him from her and her from him... would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye? 
 I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free? 
 Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink? 
 Uh! 
 Three days.  Three days. 
 Oh, Mr. Gibbs. 
 Aye. 
 Uh, I feel sullied and unusual. 
 And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days? 
 Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be. 
 Ah... Tortuga! 
 Tortuga. 
 It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then? 
 I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters. 
 A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep well each night, thank you. 
 S-S-Sir! 
 She wants you to... do something. 
 She's tryna give a sign. 
 Over there! Look for a sign! 
 Look there! There it is. There's the sign. 
 ?BURSAR That's seaweed. 
 S-Seaweed can be a sign. 
 ?BURSAR Looks like entrails. 
 What's that over there? 
 And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl? 
 Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young. 
 You'll do. Make your mark. Next! 
 My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm drunk for a month. And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die. 
 Perfect! Next! 
 It's the crow's nest for you. 
 I know what I want. 
 Next! 
 Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas. Forever. 
 Sooner than you think. Sign the roster. 
 Thanks very much. 
 How we going? 
 Including those four? That gives us - four! 
 And what's *your* story? 
 My story... it's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the Seven Seas. The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life. 
 Commodore? 
 No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*? I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the... hurricane. 
 Lord. You didn't try to sail through it? 
 So do I make your crew, or not? You haven't said where you're going. Somewhere *nice*! 
 So am I *worthy* to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow? 
 Or should I just kill you now? 
 You're hired. 
 Sorry. Old habits and all that. 
 Time to go? 
 Aye! 
 Thanks, mate. 
 Carry on. 
 Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first? 
 I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself! 
 James Norrington.  What has the world done to you? 
 BO'SUN Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner! 
 BO'SUN Step ?to-it/?tight! 
 BO'SUN ?Regain-?yourselves!/?Mind-?yourself! 
 BO'SUN Haul that weevil to his feet! 
 BO'SUN Five lashes to remind you... to stay on 'em! 
 BO'SUN Impeding me in my duties. You'll share the punishment. 
 Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity? 
 Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is. 
 The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own. 
 Bo'sun! 
 BO'SUN You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha!

 The deadman's chest. 
 Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart, or there'll be no captain. And if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key. 
 Hidden. 
 Hidden. 
 Captain Sparrow! 
 Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard. 
 I'm here to find the man I love. 
 I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea. 
 Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow. 
 Elizabeth.  Hide the rum. 
 You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin. 
 Jack. I know Will came to find you. Where is he? 
 Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew. 
 Davy Jones? 
 Oh, please. The captain of the Flying Dutchman. 
 You look bloody awful. What are you doing here? 
 You *hired* me. I can't help it if your standards are lax. 
 You *smell* funny. 
 Jack. All I want is to find Will. 
 Are you certain? Is that what you really want most? 
 'Course. 
 Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most. 
 And you have a way of doing that? 
 Well, there is a chest... 
 Oh, dear. 
 A chest of unknown size and origin. 
 What contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones. 
 Unh-unh... unh-unh... unh-unh... 
 And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate. 
 You don't actually believe him, do you? 
 How do we find it? 
 With this. My Compass... is unique. 
 "Unique" here having the meaning of broken. 
 True enough. This Compass does not point north. 
 Where does it point? 
 It points to the thing you want most in this world. 
 Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth? 
 Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not? 
 To save Will? 
 By finding the chest of Davy Jones. 
 Mister Gibbs! 
 Cap'n. 
 We have our heading. 
 Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and prow that canvas!

 Beckett! 
 Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company. 
 Agh. 
 Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word. 
 Agh. 
 Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason for that. 
 Of course. He wants the chest. 
 Yes, he did say something about a chest. 
 If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea. 
 A truly discomforting notion, love. 
 And bad. Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. Brace the foreyard! 
 Might I inquire how as to how you came by these? 
 Persuasion. 
 Friendly? 
 Decidedly not. 
 Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price. 
 Jack, the Letters, give them back. 
 No. Persuade me. 
 You do know Will taught me how handle a sword. 
 As I said... Persuade me. 
 It's a curious thing. There was a time when I would've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me. 
 I don't know what you mean. 
 Oh, I think you do. 
 Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's all. 
 So you never wondered how your *latest* fiancé ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place? 
 Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters. 
 And what are we running from? 
 It was found aboard the ship. The crew it thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate. 
 Oh, yes. ?Proceededly foolish. 
 It brought good fortune! The spirit told us... Put in at Tortuga. And we made a nice bit of profit there. 
 ?BELLAMY Off the books, of course. 
 Why do you ask? 
 Captain, a ship's been spotted. 
 Colors? 
 She isn't flyin' any. 
 Pirates!

 ?BELLAMY Free the rudder! Hard to port, then hard to starboard!

 The boy's not here. He must've been claimed by the sea. 
 *I* am the sea. 
 You need time alone with your thoughts. 
 There are no survivors. 
 The chest is no longer safe. Chart a course to Isla Cruces. Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay. 
 First? 
 Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship? Who told them of the key? Jack Sparrow. 
 My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled. 
 I just thought I'd be married by now. I'm so ready to be married. 
 You know...  Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*! 
 No, thank you. 
 Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us. 
 Oh. Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center. And personal hygiene. 
 Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it. 
 You seem very certain. 
 One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist. 
 Why doesn't your Compass work? 
 Uh my Compass works fine. 
 Because you and I *are* alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing. 
 I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by. 
 You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous. And when you do, you'll discover something: that you're a good man. 
 All evidence to the contrary. 
 I have faith in you. Want to know why? 
 Do tell, dearie. 
 Curiosity. You're going to want it. A chance to be admired. And gain the rewards that follow. You won't be able to resist. You're going to want to know... what it tastes like. 
 I *do* want to know what it tastes like. 
 But - seeing as you're a good man I know you will *never* put me in a position that would compromise my honor. 
 I'm proud of you, Jack. 
 ?GIBBS Land ho! 
 I want my jar of dirt. 
 You're pullin' too fast. 
 You're pulling too slow. We don't want the Kraken to catch us. 
 I'm savin' me strength for when it comes. And I don't think it's Krack-en, anyways. I always heard it said Kray-kin. 
 What, with a long A? 
 Aye. 
 No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en's how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en's closer to that. 
 Well we ain't original Scandinavians, are we? Kray-ken! 
 It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants. 
 beach 
 Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt. 
 This doesn't work. And it *certainly* doesn't show you what you want most. 
 Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it! 
 Beg your pardon? 
 Move. 
 "Mind the tide." 
 I ?can/?may join the circus! 
 ?Don't ?mind ?if I shine your shoes, Sir? 
 deck 
 They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade. 
 Then trust us to act in your stead. 
 I'll trust you know what awaits should you *fail*! Down, then! 
 Down! 
 beach 
 It's real! 
 You actually *were* telling the truth. 
 I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised. 
 Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you! 
 How did you get here? 
 Not so easy, is it? 
 You do? 
 What? 
 What? 
 Oh! Well... you're welcome, then. 
 Everything you said to me... every word, was a lie! 
 Pretty much. Time and tide, love. 
 Oy! What're you doing? 
 Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key. 
 I can't let you do that, either. So sorry. 
 I knew you'd warm up to me eventually. 
 Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, and get my life back. 
 Ah. The dark side of ambition. 
 Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption. 
 Stop it! 
 Jack! 
 *No*! 
 This is bar-*baric*! This is *no* way for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! Let's just - *pull* out our swords and start *banging* away at each other! *This will solve everything!* I've had it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked... *pirates*! 
 How'd this go all screwy? 
 Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there - I figure 'e's tryna... settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father. 
 Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny. 
 Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation. 
 If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd remove temptation from their path. 
 Will! *Enough!* 
 Oh! Oh...! The heat! 
 By your leave, Mister Turner. 
 church 
 Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life. 
 Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates? 
 Enough! 
 Unfortunately, Mister Turner... He's *right*! 
 Still rooting for you, mate! 
 Wup! 
 Oh. 
 Woah! 
 'Ello, Poppet. 
 Sword! 
 Sword! 
 Sword! 
 Aya! Uh ?seech!  Aunido! Aunido! Follow my voice! Follow my voice! To the left, uh... No, to the right... Go to the left... 
 No... That's a tree. 
 Oh, shut it. 
 beach 
 Jar of dirt! 
 Come on, Turner! 
 Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with. 
 We're not getting out of this. 
 Not with the chest. Into the boat. 
 You're mad. 
 Don't wait for me. 
 Uh, I say we respect his final wish. 
 Aye! 
 Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold... dead... hands. 
 Here you go! 
 Oo! 
 Uh! ?Ando! Aunido! Aunido!  Pirates! 
 ?Vengo ?kowmpenay ?lachay. Hey! ?Hovaya! 
 Norrington took it to draw them off. 
 You're pulling too hard! 
 You're not pulling hard enough! 
 Where's the Commodore? 
 He fell behind. 
 My prayers be with him. Best not wallow in our grief. The bright side is: You're back. And made it off free and clear. 
 Lord almighty.?us. 
 I'll handle this, mate. 
 Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey? Oup! 
 Got it! 
 Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got.  I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it? 
 Enough! 
 Hard to starboard. 
 *Hard to starboard!* 
 Hard to starboard! 
 Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths! 
 ?PINTEL She's on us! She's on us! 
 Let them taste the triple guns. 
 She's falling behind! 
 Aye, and we've got her! 
 Against the wind the Dutchman beats us. That's how she takes her prey. But *with* the wind... 
 Ah! 
 deck 
 They're out of range! ?Break ?out ?run ### 
 
 ?MARTY They're giving up! Yay! 
 Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs... is the proper leverage. 
 Where is it? Where is the thump-thump? 
 What is it? 
 ?GIBBS All guns, defend the masts! 
 Will? 
 Will? 
 I think we've held fire long enough. 
 *Will?* 
 There's no boats. 
 As soon as you're clear. 
 There's only half a dozen kegs of powder! 
 Aye! The rum, too! 
 Step to! 
 Oh you coward! 
 Not good. 
 Heave! Heave like you're being paid for it! 
 Did we kill it? 
 No. We just made it angry. We're not out of this yet. Captain! Orders! 
 Abandon ship. Into the longboat. 
 Jack! The Pearl! 
 She's only a ship, mate. 
 He's right, we have to head for land. 
 'S a lot o' open wa'er. 
 That's a lot o' wa'er. 
 Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon hope. 
 Thank you, Jack. 
 We're not free yet, love. 
 You came back. I always knew you were a good man. 
 Prepare to cast off! There's no time to lose! Come on, Will, step to! 
 It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry. 
 Pirate. 
 He elected to stay behind to give us a chance. 
 Go! 
 Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...! 
 Come on... Come on... 
 Not so bad. 
 Oh! 
 Hello, beastie.

 Jack Sparrow. Our debt is settled. 
 The captain goes down with his ship. 
 Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil. 
 Open the chest. Open the chest, I need to see it! 
 Damn you, Jack Spar-*row*! 
 EITC headquarters 
 The last of our ships has returned. 
 None. But... one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea. He had these. 
 I took the liberty of filling in my name. 
 Better.  The heart of Davy Jones. 
 Tia's shack 
 Against de cold... and de sorrow. 
 It's a shame. I know you're t'inking that wid the Pearl, you coulda captured the devil and set free your fadder's soul. 
 Aye. And already the world seems a bit less bright. He fooled us all right to the end. But I guess that honest streak finally won out. To Jack Sparrow! 
 Never another like Captain Jack. 
 He was a gentleman of fortune, he was. 
 He was a good man. 
 Would you do it? Hmmm?  What... would you? Hmmm? What would *any* of you be willing to do? Hmmm? Would you sail to the ends of the eart', and beyond, to fetch back ?witty Jack and 'im precious Pearl? 
 Aye. 
 Aye. 
 Aye. 
 COTTON'S PARROT Awk! Aye. 
 Yes. 
 Alright. But if you're goin' brave de weird, and haunted shores, at world's end, den... you will need a captain who knows dose waters.

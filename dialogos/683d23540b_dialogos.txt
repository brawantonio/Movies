 
 "COMMANDO" BLACK SCREEN. One word explodes towards us with cold brutality:. It FADES... leaves us in darkness. And we HEAR a growing ROAR... a frightening RUMBLE. 
 What's that? 
 
 (STIFLING YAWN) .the garbage men. 
 On Tuesday? 
 
 Shit. 
 
 I was afraid you'd miss me -- 
 6 COOKE -- The man behind the truck -- pulls an Ingram submachine gun INTO VIEW. At the same moment, the cab of the garbage truck is kicked open and DIAZ, the driver, leans out, similarly armed. 
 Don't worry-we won't. And they cut Lawson down, the bullets raking across his body and the cans. 
 You ain't seen nothin' yet. Cont. 
 (as trunk closes) Hear that sound? American workmanship. You think the Japanese invented that? Bullshit We did...sure, we lost it for a while-but we got 'it back. Diaz gets into the car. 
 Sure, get in...comfy, right? I know what you're gonna say... it's cloth. But take it from me-you don't want leather, it's hot, it cracks, it's trouble. And look at the head room.. .you're not gonna have a problem... Diaz starts the engine. 
 Go ahead, start it up. Hear that? That's power-that's performance .that's -- Jesus Christ -- Forrestal has said this last because Diaz has thrown the car into reverse, knocking down a big display. 
 Hey! 
 9 Diaz slams the car into forward, hits the accelerator and ROARS across the display room floor. The car SLAMS into Forrestal, flinging his body across the hood. The car continues on, CRASHES through the outside window and disappears down the street. 
 That's all for me, Les. Les nods. Bennett steps off the boat, crosses over another boat and steps onto his boat. 
 BENNETT'S BOAT Bennett starts his boat, revs the throttle, then pulls away from the other boats. The wind whips his hair as he cruises out into the night. 
 16 as a giant FIGURE descends from the mountains behind the house balancing a giant log on his right shoulder and carrying a chain saw in his left hand. This is COLONEL JOHN ALEXANDER MATRIX. He's in his mid-thirties ...a man of raw power and vitality...and something else: Joy. Joy, and a sense of calm. Matrix reaches a shed behind the cabin. He puts down the log and chain saw, then picks up firewood and begins to SPLIT it with awesome single swipes of an axe. 
 A. A cracks. 
 B. A scampers away, startled. 
 C. roll away. 
 D. A responds with a faint creak while: 
 Dad... Dad... put me down. She tickles him back on his neck and ribs...he laughs, puts her down. 
 I surrender, I surrender. He raises his hands, open, trusting. Instantly she attacks again, then runs like hell as he pursues her, 
. 
 26-A shows Jenny karate moves. She tries a move on him and he pretends she's knocked him over. 
 26-B gives Jenny a piggyback ride over the bridge that crosses the stream, as they head back to the cabin. 
 When I was a boy and rock and roll came to East Germany, the communists said it was subversive... 
 (SLIGHT SMILE) .They were right... 
 (BITES INTO 
 
 You don't want to know. Suddenly Matrix gets an odd look on his face ...he stands, cocks his head. 
 What's wrong? He shushes her, puts his hand up to block the sun as he peers through the picture window. Now Jenny -- and the audience -- can SEE what matrix's keen senses have already heard-an approaching aircraft. 
 MATRIX'S P.O.V. - HELICOPTER 29 with U.S. Army markings, coming towards the house... then veering off for a landing. 
 You said you wouldn't go away again. You said you were through -- 
 I'm not going anywhere. Cont. 
 Promise? 
 Promise. 
 32 Kirby approaches the cabin. 
 
 (o.s.) I know. Startled, Kirby whirls to see Matrix standing behind him. 
 Silent and smooth...just like always. He smiles and he and Matrix come together and shake hands. 
 I better be. You taught me. He affectionately squeezes Kirby's shoulder. Jenny comes out of the cabin toward the two men. 
 I need to talk to your dad, Jenny. 
 No way, Jose. Matrix gives her a sharp look and Jenny grudgingly goes back inside. Kirby and Matrix begin to walk as clouds billow high above the mountaintops around them. Cont. 
 Someone's killing your men. 
 
 There must have been a leak. Lawson, Forrestal... Bennett have all been hit. 
 Who's doing it? X 
 You've made enemies all over the X world, John. It could be the Syrians, the South Africans, the Russians-or a terrorist group. 
 We were going to make a normal X life here... 
 You will...I promise. I'm going X into the city to coordinate with the Federal people. In the meantime, Jackson and Harris will stay with you. Matrix looks the two soldiers over. 
 They any good? 
 Real good... 
 MATRIX - LATER 37 watches the chopper lift off and fly away. Jenny, subdued, comes out of the cabin. 
 Is it bad? 
 I'm not leaving you... if that's what you mean. 
 Then it can't be bad. She smiles. An intense look comes over Matrix's face, then -- In a BLUR, he sweeps up Jenny in his arms just before machine gun fire BLASTS the cabin. The VOLLEY OF FIRING SHATTERS the windows and RIPS OPEN Harris' chest, his blood SPLATTERING against the cabin. .Matrix, still clutching Jenny, DIVES through the door into the cabin and HITS the floor. Jackson CATCHES a round in the shoulder, SPINS to the ground, then crawls through the door after Matrix. The three of them lie on the cabin floor as the FIRING CONTINUES to BLAST AWAY at Harris' body, the rounds SMACKING into the side of the cabin. Then the firing stops. Silence. 
 
 
 
 
 I did. Matrix and Jenny move low to the floor toward her bedroom. 
 
 40 hears a THUMP and sticks her head out from under her bed to look, but sees nothing. Suddenly, footsteps approach her bedroom door. She pulls her head back under the bed just as two boots enter her bedroom. A knife is attached to one of the boots. 
 Where is she? Diaz smiles and puts his feet up on a table. 
 Mellow out, man. We can't talk business with you waving guns in people's faces. Matrix puts the rifle against Diaz's forehead and COCKS the trigger. The smile vanishes from Diaz's face. 
 She's safe, Major. Whether she stays that way.is up to you. My people got some business with you... Matrix hears a NOISE outside, glances out the window and sees two vehicles RACING away from the house. 
 .and if you want your kid back, you gotta cooperate. Right? 
 Wrong. Matrix levels the H&K and BLASTS Diaz in the chest. Diaz and the chair are JERKED violently backward. 
 46 It takes another curve. CAMERA PANS UP, and we SEE the Blazer, coming closer and closer by this direct route. 
 53 A large group of armed soldiers start to surround Matrix. He stands up, cut, bleeding. The lead man approaches to frisk him. 
 54 Matrix ELBOWS him in the stomach, DRIVES his fist into the man's Adam's apple, PULLS HIM DOWN, CRACKS the man's vertebrae, grabs the dead man's rifle and SLAMS the butt against the face on the man closing on him. The man's jaw SHATTERS. But three more men are immediately on Matrix and they wrestle him to the ground. He forces his way up again, the three men still all over him. Matrix's eyes suddenly WIDEN as he looks at two boots with an attached knife, then up at the man standing in them. It's Bennett, the man we saw die! 
 
 Dead... He FIRES at point-blank range. Matrix is BLASTED backward to the ground. 
 An intense white light SHIMMERS at the CAMERA, almost as if the light were floating on water. It is so BRIGHT it hurts our eyes. 
 Matrix's motionless body is lying on a slab of a table. His eyes slowly open as he looks at the same BRIGHT LIGHT. That light in on the ceiling of the small room he is lying in. Matrix groggily shakes his head, sits up a little and sees Bennett holding up the bulky gun. 
 Tranquilizers. General Arius approaches Matrix. 
 Remember me, Major? 
 I remember the people you tortured and killed. 
 You don't understand a country like Val Verde, Major. It needs a president with an iron hand. It needs my hand again. 
 Why tell me? 
 Because you're going to return to Val Verde and kill the president you helped to overthrow me. Cont. 
 Why don't you have Bennett do it -- he was there with me. 
 But President Velasquez trusts you; after all, he made you a 
 (IRONIC SMILE) 'Hero of the Revolution...' 
 (SMILE VANISHES) While Captain Bennett, left, shall we say, under a cloud... 
 (glances at Bennett) He enjoyed the killing a little too much. 
 You trained me, Major. 
 
 And if I don't? Arius looks at Matrix for a beat, then Arius nods to Bennett. Bennett opens a sliding door to a closet and matrix sees Jenny. She is gagged and tied tightly to a chair. She is shaking from fear and her eyes are wet with tears. Matrix LUNGES up from the table, but his hands and feet are chained to the table and he is STOPPED. Bennett wheels Jenny out of the closet over to Arius. Arius begins to finger her hair. 
 So pretty-There are many things I'm going to teach her. Cont. 
 You kill Velasquez, Major, and you'll get her back. You try anything else... 
 Any sign of Matrix? 
 No Sir, just those bodies... 
 (PAUSES) .You think there's more? 
 If he's still alive, I'd expect a lot more. 
 
 I'll be back, Bennett... For you. 
 I'll be ready. They eye each other, then Sully shuts the door and Matrix watches the limo drive off. Henriques and Sully flank Matrix and they enter the terminal. 
 63 They approach the boarding gate. Sully hands Henriques and Matrix their tickets, then Sully stuffs a $10.00 bill in Matrix's breast pocket. 
 You're a nice guy, Sully, I like you... 
 REVISED - "COMMANDO" - 4/24/85 
 Open your mouth again and I'll nail it shut. Matrix looks up at a wall clock. It reads 6:55. He X. and Henriques board the plane as Sully watches from the boarding area. 
 First class, seats seven A and B. They are the last passengers to be seated. They walk down the aisle, Matrix takes the window seat and Henriques the aisle seat. A NOISE attracts Matrix's attention and he watches the door to the entrance tunnel CLOSE. The Stewardesses prepare for the takeoff as the plane's engines begin to RUMBLE. Matrix edgily looks around the plane. The Stewardess approaches him. 
 You must fasten your seat belt, Sir. Matrix looks out the window and sees Sully looking right back at him through the waiting room window. Matrix turns to the Stewardess. 
 Could I have a blanket and pillow? 
 Sure. She takes them down from the upper compartment and hands them to Matrix. Cont. 
. Matrix stands and opens the overhead luggage rack. He picks up the blanket covered body and puts it in the overhead rack. The 2ND STEWARDESS comes by. 
 It's no problem. He smiles at her and she smiles back. He closes the luggage compartment door and turns to the Stewardess. 
 How long is this flight? 
 INSERT - WATCH 65 11:00:00 appears on the watchface. Instantly, it starts counting down: 10:59:59, 10:59:58... 
 66 Matrix starts down the aisle. Cont. 
 
 (COVERING MOUTH) I'm airsick... He pushes by her. 
 67-A the elevator stops in the service area of the big plane. Matrix gets out of the elevator and looks out a port. The place is moving faster! He turns and moves to a door marked CARGO HOLD. It's locked. He PULLS, the door starts to bend, then the lock suddenly SNAPS. He opens the door and crawls inside. 
 68 The passengers sit unaware of anything unusual. 
 69 A CLOSE-UP of the latch on the luggage compartment holding Henriques' body shows the latch imperceptively 
. 
 75 A doberman Pinscher SNARLS and FLASHES HIS TEETH right INTO the CAMERA. Matrix jerks his hand away from the dog cage just as the Pinscher's teeth push between the bars. 
 INSERT - WATCH 10:52:52 left. 
 He looks at the terminal in the distance and begins running toward it. 
 REVISED - "COMMANDO" - 4/24/85 
 87 Jenny is huddled in a darkened cabin below. She wipes the tears from her eyes. The door opens, some light comes in and Arius enters the cabin. He moves toward Jenny and looks at her for a long beat. 
 Your father has just left for Val Verde; he should be back with you soon. Does that make you happy? 
 Yes... Arius sits down right next to her. He runs his fingers along her shoulder. 
 Is there anything else that would make you happy? 
 Yes... 
 
 (INTO PHONE) Hi, Lance, it's me! 
 (PAUSE) Cindy. Very funny ...yes, that Cindy. They just cancelled my 7:40 X to Vancouver... Cont. 
 
 (INTO PHONE) I thought since I'm laid over we could... no, laid over, Lance. Samantha? Who's that? Lance? Lance? She slams down the phone and does a slow burn. Then she turns, picks up her flight bag, starts to head off and finds her path suddenly blocked by Sully. 
 Fuck off, shithead... She pushes by him. Sully watches her go, smiles and then begins to follow her. 
 REVISED - "COMMANDO" - 4/29/85 26, 
 Yeah, herpes. Sully's smile disappears. He looks at her, takes his sunglasses out of his coat pocket, nuts them back on, then turns and walks off. Cindy watches him to make sure he leaves. All of a SUDDEN, a giant arm encircles her waist from behind. 
 
 (WHISPERS) Don't move. She looks down at the giant arm, unable to see Matrix sqatting behind her. 
 I'm not moving. 
 I'm not going to hurt you. 
 That's what they all say. 
 â€¢ Step to the side. 
 I have to move to do that. Matrix removes his arm from her waist. 
 Do it. Knees shaking, Cindy steps aside. Matrix leans into the car, grabs the passenger seat, YANKS it out and places it on the ground at Cindy's feet. Cindy, mouth gaping open, looks at the passenger seat now at her feet. 
 I'LLTR IX Get in. Cindy automatically starts to get in the car. Cont. 
 REVISED - "COMMANDO" - 4/29/85 27 
 You forgot your keys. 
 Just do what I tell you and I'll let you go. 
 I've got to give Karate, junitsu, judo, and kung-fu lessons to my students at seven-thirty. 
 You're not gonna make it. She starts the car. Sully drives by them in his Porsche Targa. 
 Follow him. 
 I knew you were going to say that. She pops the clutch too fast, the tires SQUEAL and Matrix is SLAMMED back against the car floor. 
 Don't get offended by this question, but...

 If you're in a hurry, don't let me hold you up... The elevator returns and they get in. 
 X (whispered, anxious) My daughter's been kidnapped and he's my only chance of finding her! If he sees me or I lose him, they'll kill her. I need you to follow him; if I get too close, he'll run. Cindy looks back at Matrix in shock. 
 (pleading, desperate) Please help me, you're my only X chance! She's got less than ten hours left. Cindy doesn't know what to say. Matrix, still holding her arm, SHAKES her in desperation. Cont.

 (whispered, desperate) 
 Okay, okay. X 
 Take it easy, all right. She continues to look at the pleading Matrix, then she turns and hesitantly begins walking toward Sully. Sully walks by a video game parlor, ogles some girls, checks his watch, then heads for the bar on this level. 
 101 New Wave music PLAYS as valley gals and sharp dudes dance and mingle about. Sully can dig this scene -- he puts his dark glasses back on. He sits at a table, puts the briefcase next to his leg and orders a drink. A LATIN MAN wearing a leisure suit, looking completely out of place in a joint like this, enters the bar, and stares at a girl with purple hair. He continues into the bar, catches Sully's eye and sits down at the table with him. He reaches under the table and slides the briefcase away from Sully until its next to himself, then hands Sully, still under the table, a bunch of passports. 
 102 Cindy approaches the bar, hesitates, then looks back at Matrix. Across the open space, he nods, urging her forward. She hesitantly moves forward. 
 Cindy enters the bar, then sees a young security guard, CATES, coming out of the men's room. She moves around a corner so Matrix can't see her and she stops the guard. 
 There's a huge guy across the way who either honestly needs my help or he's an escaped mental fruitcake. Take a look... Cates moves into the doorway, casually glances at Matrix watching the bar, then Cates moves out of Matrix's view. He removes the walkie-talkie from his belt and speaks into it. 
 Biggs, you there? 
 Another security guard, BIGGS, a muscular black kid, is flirting with some valley girls and ignoring the constant BEEPING of his walkie-talkie. Cont. 
 .This ain't no Mexican shit, I'm talkin' Maui wowie. Tired of the BEEPING, he picks up his walkie-talkie. 
 
 
 There's a guy up here who may be a wacko. I don't think I can handle him alone. 
 Cool down, puke breath, I'll be right there. (smiling to girls) Wanna see me kick some ass? 
 106 Matrix is getting anxious. He looks at his watch. 
 107 Sully is in conversation with the Latin man, unaware of what's going on outside. Cindy sneaks a look outside and sees Biggs and his two valley girls approaching Matrix. 
 108 Biggs confidently walks along the top level, the girls following. He STOPS abruptly as he sees Matrix, his eyes bulge and he retreats into an alcove and pulls out his walkie-talkie. 
 Attention all units! Emergency on the theater level! Suspect is six-foot-two, brown hair... 
 (PAUSE) .and is one gigantic motherfucker?! 
 109 Cates and Cindy are still out of Matrix's view. Cont. 
 You'd better stay here, Miss. He exits from the bar and moves toward Matrix. Cindy waits, biting her lip, wondering if she's done the wrong thing. Sully, still talking to the Latin, looks up and finally notices Cindy. He moves through the dancers toward her. 
 Matrix anxiously glances at his watch, then looks up toward the bar. Cindy comes out into the doorway where he can see her. She glances behind him, then helplessly looks right at him. Matrix, noticing her glance behind him, turns around. Five security guards are now approaching him. 
 Sully moves toward Cindy. at the doorway. Just as he is about to say something to her, he hears a commotion and glances outside. 
 Matrix turns from the guards to point at Cindy in the bar and he suddenly sees Sully approaching her. 
 Sully looks out toward the commotion and suddenly sees Matrix. And Matrix is pointing right at him! 
 Sully runs, bumping off of Cindy, and races out onto the top level. Matrix, seeing him run, turns back to the guards advancing on him and SMASHES the lead guard (Biggs) right in the face. Biggs is BLASTED backward into the other guards, KNOCKING two of them down. Matrix sees Sully running and then looks where's he's headed. A phone booth. 
 
 Freeze!! The Latin SHOOTS away at the Officers, BLASTING one in the chest and KNOCKING him rolling and tumbling backwards down the escalator. The other Officer FIRES AWAY at the Latin, hitting him twice. The Latin SLAMS agains the railing, the briefcase bursting open. 
 118 The Latin, blood oozing out his stomach and eyes drifting in his head, reaches over the railing to grasp futilely at the money. He reaches too far. 
 Don't! d! Matrix JUMPS, hanging onto the banner. Cindy KNOCKS the cop's aim away. The gun FIRES, missing Matrix. Cont.

 X No... Sully's Corvette disappears around a curve, Matrix cuts the corner TIGHTLY and SUDDENLY a large truck 
 Look out!! 
 REVISED - "COMMANDO" - 4/24/85 37 130 Cont. Matrix swerves the Sunbeam at the last moment, just grazes by the truck, and keeps going. Cindy has slid down in her seat and covered her face with her hands. She now opens her fingers, peeks through, then lowers her hands. She looks at Matrix. 
 How'd you ever get a driver's license? 
 I didn't... 
! The windshield on the Sunbeam SPLINTERS. Matrix floors the car and completely SMASHES it into the back of Sully's car. WHAM! Sully's car SKIDS off the road, FLIPS a couple times, then CRASHES into the inside face of the cliff. Matrix and Cindy SKID off the road and CRASH into the X inside face of the cliff.

 I can't hear you, Sully.

 Loyalty is touching, Sully, but it's not important in your life right now... 
 Â€¢ But take gravity... He extends his arms and DANGLES Sully upside-down over the sharp drop. The Los Angeles Basin is spread out below, 180 degrees of twinkling lights. 
 Gravity is very important in your life right now. Cont.

 I have to warn you, Sully... 
 (DEFIANT) You can't kill me, Matrix. You X need me to find your daughter. 
 Where is she? He SHAKES Sully, moving him like a fish on a line. 
 But you won't.

 Now I do... 
 Wait a minute... Matrix looks at her. 
 What'd you do with Sully?

 They enter a room that has been stripped of all furnishings, the windows boarded over. Arius LOCKS the door again, then looks up and down at Jenny. She takes a few hesitant steps backward. He gazes at her, then steps out into the hallway and CLOSES the door. Suddenly, the lights in the room go out, plunging Jenny into darkness. Jenny moves against a wall, slides to a sitting position on the floor and begins to shiver from the cold. 
 REVISED - "COMMANDO" - 4/24/85 41 
 I'm sorry I got you involved in this. 
 Then why won't you tell me what it's about. Matrix reaches into his pocket, pulls out his wallet, opens it and hands it to Cindy. 
 It's about her. Cindy looks at a photo tucked into a wallet, clear plastic photo insert. 
 Is she the one that was kidnapped? Matrix nods. 
 Some people are using her to force me to do a job. If I don't get to her soon, they'll kill her. 
 Did you do the job? 
 No. I knew they'd kill her even if I did it. The only chance she has is if I get to her before they know what I'm doing. Cindy looks at the photo.

Cindy tears the covers off the bed, musses up her hair and unbuttons her blouse to show some cleavage. Matrix and Cindy edge up to the door and Matrix flattens himself aginst the wall close to the door. Cont.

 He's in the shower. Cooke listens a beat to the running shower. 
 Who're you? Cindy looks him up and down, then slouches toward the crack so her breasts push at her blouse. She smiles. 
 Room service... Cooke looks back through the door at her. Matrix, at the inside edge of the door,is holding_his gun, ready to fire. Matrix can only see Cindy. 
 Open the door. Cindy unlocks the chain and opens the door. 
 Move out of the way. Cindy moves away from the door. Matrix tenses, ready to attack. Cooke looks into the room at the rumpled bed, suitcase and fast food containers. The shower SOUNDS continue to echo from the bathroom. Cooke cautiously enters the doorway. WHAM! Matrix SLAMS the gun against the brawny Cooke's head. Cooke crashes back against the wall, but doesn't go down. He grabs Matrix's gun hand by the wrist and the two of them STRUGGLE for the gun. BLAM! BLAM! The gun FIRES into the ceiling as they wrestle around the room. They BREAK a table and CRASH into a chest of drawers. Cont. 
 A twenty-year-old couple in bed look up in shock as Matrix and Cooke bounce off their bed and SLAM against the wall. BLAM! The gun FIRES, SHATTERING the mirror above the young couple and they SCRAMBLE to safety on the floor on the other side of the bed. Matrix and Cooke come off the wall and SLAM onto the floor, the gun coming out of Matrix's hand. Cooke picks it up before Matrix can reach it. Cooke points the gun right at Matrix's face, pulls back the trigger, then smiles. 
 Fuck you, asshole. He pulls the trigger. CLICK. No more bullets in the bun. The blood drains from Cooke's face. Matrix looks at him. 
 Fuck you, asshole... He BLASTS Cooke in the jaw and Cooke goes backward through the broken door and falls to the floor. 
 Matrix races back through the broken door, starts toward Cooke, then stops cold. Cooke has fallen on the broken, sharp table leg and the leg goes into his back and comes out of his chest. Cont. 
 Where is she, Cooke? Cooke looks blankly back at him. 
 Cooke... Cooke!! Cooke's eyes go cold and still. He's dead. Cindy approaches and swallows as she looks down at his body, the stake coming out of his chest. Matrix starts emptying Cooke's pockets. There's a wallet containing only cash. Matrix tosses it to the floor. He brings out a lighter and a package of cigarettes, examines the lighter, then tosses both objects to the floor. He pulls out two keys on a key chain. They're car keys. Matrix leaps to his feet. 
 Come on!

 INSERT - PAPER 146 It's an invoice from "Coastal Fuel, 110 Hermosa St., Long Beach, California, 90802" to "Patria Enterprises, 50 Redonda St., San Pedro, California, 90733." 
 Make any sense to you? 
 Coastal is a fuel depot that supplies planes. 
 For who -- the airlines? 
 No, usually smaller, private aircraft. 
 You sure? 
 I'm getting my pilot's license. Coastal is where my instructor gets his fuel. 
 There's a lot of warehouses around Redondo Street. Arius must be keeping a plane there. Matrix closes the car door and pockets the invoice. 
 Let's go. 
'S P.O.V. The soldiers move weapons, metal containers and wooden crates from the trucks to the jeeps. A soldier's feet walk right in front of Matrix, the soldier unloads a crate onto the jeep above Matrix, then the feet move away. 
 Matrix crawls away from the jeeps, moves low through the shadows, goes into a corridor and sees a door ajar. 
'S P.O.V. A soldier, Vega, is looking at some charts on a table. 
 Matrix pushes open the door slightly to see into the rest of the room. As the door moves, it CREAKS on its hinge. 
 Vega looks up from the charts and sees the door is open more then it was. He pauses, then starts walking toward the door. 
 Matrix starts to move away from the door, then stops. He hears FOOTSTEPS and CONVERSATION approaching the other end of the corridor. He's trapped! 
 157 Vega is two feet away from the inside of the door. 
 158 Matrix desperately grabs the door handle and pushes the door forward. 
 159 Matrix SLAMS his fist into Vega's stomach, then quickly MOVES into the room, puts a choke hold around Vega with his left arm, then carefully closes the door with his right. As soon as the door closes, the FOOTSTEPS and CONVERSATION pass right by the door outside in the corridor. Matrix pulls Vega toward the back of the room, SMASHES his Adam's apple, opens a closet,,drops the dead Vega inside, then closes the door. He moves to the door leading outside the warehouse, opens it and Cindy enters. They begin to whisper. 
 I saw all the equipment, but there's no plane. 
 What about your daughter? Matrix shakes his head. 
 Arius and Bennett aren't here. She's wherever they are. Matrix looks at Cindy in desperation for a beat, then they begin to look around the room. The room is designed as the aircraft control room. There are aerial charts on the tables and the walls. There are photos of several military planes and a civilian amphibious plane. There are copies of weather reports situated around the room and there is a VHF radio. 
 Matrix notes a set of military map coordinates penciled onto the side of a chart. They read, 8734-5245; 8142-5938; 7565-5474. A "Scale line" is drawn under the coordinates. 
 He studies the coordinates, then picks up a drafting compass and pen. He puts three dots, which corresponds to the three sets of coordinates onto a coasted chart of Southern California. 
 Cindy is studying the photos of the aircraft. 
 Matrix sets the width of the legs of the drafting compass, then puts the point of one of the compass legs onto one of the three dots and draws a circle. 
 Matrix uses the compass to draw a second circle. 
 CLOSEUP of the pen as it finishes a third circle, the three circles now intersecting right over a small island 200 miles west of Los Angeles. 
 Something's going on out there. Cindy looks at the chart, then back at the photos of the aircraft on the wall. Cont. 
 One of these plane's an amphibian. Maybe they're using it to fly there. Matrix comes over and looks at the photo of the amphibian. 
 Let me see that invoice. Matrix takes it out of his pocket, shows it to her and she studies it. 
 INSERT - INVOICE 168 She sees, "250 gallons of Type 4 aircraft fuel." 
 Type four fuel is amphibian and two hundred fifty gallons is what it would take to fly that plane to the island and back. 
 But it's not here. I saw everything they've got. Cindy glances at the invoice, then looks up at Matrix. 
 It was refueled at pump station thirty-two, Pacific Pier. That's San Pedro. 
 How long's it take to fly out to the island? Cont. 
 About two hours. Matrix looks at his watch. 
 INSERT - WATCH 170 The watch reads 02:56:15 and counting down. 
 171 Two soldiers, ROBERTO and Juan, come down the corridor They pass the room Matrix is in, then Roberto stops. 
 Momento... He comes back right toward Matrix's door. He turns the door handle. 
 172 He goes into the room! Matrix and Cindy are flat against the wall, hiding behind the door, inches from Roberto. 
 Vega? He looks around for a beat, then turns and leaves the room, closing the door. 
 Are we going to the plane? 
 Not yet. She looks bewilderedly at him. 
 Where are we going? 
 Shopping. 
 How do you get in? Matrix JERKS the car into reverse and RACES the car backwards around another building until the car is o. s. 
. He takes a shopping cart (like in Safeway) and starts working the aisles. Cont. 
 Come on, come on... He suddenly feels the hidden button and presses it. Behind him, a wall containing innocuous sporting equipment slides to the side, revealing a hidden room. Matrix pushes a cart into the room. The store alarm continues to CLANG. 
 178 This room is loaded with every kind of illegal weapon imaginable. It's an AWESOME sight. Matrix garbs an Israeli Desert Eagle (Monster 44 automatic handgun), a 9mm. submachine gun, a 12 gauge assault shotgun with folding stock, a Steyr 223 assault rifle, a LAW rocket launcher, grenades, dynamite and fuse, bandoliers with ammo and loads everything into the cart. 
 179 He wheels the cart out of the hidden room, moves down the aisle with it, then carefully pushes it so it rolls by itself the rest of the way to Cindy. 
 Get the car. Cindy catches the cart, glances inside and her 
. She wheels the cart away. 
 180 Matrix reenters the hidden room, sees if he's missing anything, is satisfied and leaves the room. 
 181 Matrix passes by the counter and SUDDENLY A COP comes out from behind the aisle with his shotgun pointed right at Matrix's head. He COCKS the trigger. 
 
!! Matrix quickly looks toward the other direction to flee. A SECOND COP is at the end of the other aisle with his shotgun also pointed at Matrix's head. He COCKS the trigger. Trapped! 
 
 (URGENT) If you'll call Kirby, he'll tell you!! 
 184 Daryl looks over at Fred and rolls his eyes. Fred, who's driving, smiles. 
 INSERT - WATCH 186 The watch reads 02:23:02 and counting. 
 187 Matrix LOOKS HOPELESSLY at his watch. 
 Hooker, not bad... The light turns green and Fred drives the wagon through the light. The wagon pulls ahead and Daryl looks into the outside, right rearview mirror. 
 I think she wants to give us something. Daryl looks back toward the rearview mirror. 
 Uh-oh... 
 194 Matrix, listening to the continuing explosion, reacts. 
 Where'd you learn to do that? 
 High' School. 
 INSERT - MAP 199-A The border of the country has arrows drawn at different areas showing where the guerrillas will enter the country. 
 How soon does Matrix arrive in Val Verde? Bennett glances at his watch. 
 Just over two hours. 
 Let me know as soon as he lands. 
 He'll do anything we tell him as long as he thinks he'll get his daughter back. 
 'I wonder if he knows he's never going to get her back. Arius and Bennett look at each other. 
 201 Jenny moves to the door of her darkened room and tries the door handle. Cont. 
 Don't stop. She drives through the light, takes a sharp left and begins driving on a street along the water. 
 What's wrong? 
 This isn't a plane... it's a canoe with wings. 
 Start paddling. Cant. 
 Come on, you piece of shit! He SLAMS his hand onto the control panel. 
 Works every time... Cindy REVS the engines and starts to move the plane. 
 You know what you're doing? 
 Sort of... Matrix swallows a little, bit, then turns to look out the window. They're on their way! 
 Matrix? Kirby nods. 
 Call the Federal Building. Have them monitor every police, aviation and marine channel in the area. 
 What are you expecting? 
 World War III. 
 Why'd you decide to get a pilot's license? 
 My father was an Air Force pilot. That's why I becarle a stewardess. But after a while, I got tired of serving food' and drinks. I wanted to fly the plane myself. 
 Attention, unidentified aircraft. CUT Tr-,: INT. COAST GUAFo-l CUTTER - NIGHT 222 A RADAR INTERCEPT OFFICER (with headset and lip mke) is looking over the shoulder of a radar OPERATOR at a radar scanner. 
 This is the Coast Guard Cutter ' Mcrgenthal . ' You are f lyinc_ over the San Miguel Naval Gunnery Range. This is a restricted area. 
 They shoot the shit out of this area all the time. The flights out of LAX avoid it like the plague. 
 Can you get under the radar? 
 Not marine radar, but if we get close enough to the water, the high seas effect might camouflage us. 
 Try it... Cindy dives the seaplane downward. 
 T':ATRIX When'd you get that? He reaches into one of his duffel bags and pulls out bandages and gauze. 
 The car crash. Matrix Wipes her cut and puts the banda:7e dressinc over 
 That reminds me of what I'm buying you as soon as we get back. 
 What? She expertly wraps the gauze around her leg and ties it. 
 A new car. 
 With a cassette deck? 
 With a cassette deck... She smiles. 
 
 (URGENT) Coast Guard, this is whiskey, Xray, four, four, eight. Emergency priority message for General Frederick Kirby... COMMANDO!-! say again: COMMANDO! Code red at 38 degrees nine minutes north; 119 degrees 4 minutes west. Cindy lowers the mike and hits the the throttle, moving the seaplane along the coast closer to the bathe 
 
 289 Matrix, lying hidden nearby, pulls a pin on a grenade and begins to count 
 290 The Guerrillas start to pull away in the jeep as Matrix's grenade suddenly lands in the back of the jeep. Boom! the jeep EXPLODES 
 291 Twelve Guerrillas climb into the back of a transport truck and the truck â‚¬ uic .ly gets underway. 
 MATF:IX 3 9 Matrix watches the bullets BLAST throâ€¢.:ch the heCce near him. He crawls to the side, the. rises up an:: FIRES the automatic handgun at the he,:ce where he saw Arius. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM! 
'S 330 Arius watches the bullets BLAST throuc the hedge near him. He starts crawling to the size and then crawls, following the hedge, towar6 Matrix. He and Matrix are like cat and mouse. 
 331 Matrix is crawling, following a hedge, toward Arius. He cares up to the dear: Guerrilla with the flame thr; wer, that Matrix k.:iled in the Rose Garden earlier, then Matrix crawls around him. 
' F.O.V. 3-, he sees what looks l iue movement in a hedge. AR I is S Arms rises, FIRES his submachine gun at the movement, then quickly lowers himself to the g. rc He hears somerr: m lines. 
 M A Chhhh... They are dying sounds. Arius cautiously rises, gun pointed at the hedge he shot at. 
 342 He moves silently through the garden room, looking at the dead bodies lying around the courtyard and front hall. 
 343 He cautiously edges along the dining room. 
 344 He enters the kitchen, then STOPS COLD. He looks at what's facing him. Bennett, holding Jenny, has the switchblade PRESSED AGAINST her throat. Matrix points his handgun right at Bennett. Bennett pulls Jenny close against his chest and face, shielding himself. 
 
 
 (SCREAMS) 
!! 
 (crazed, to Matrix) 
 
!! Matrix hesitates a short beat, then he moves back toward the dining room. 
 345 Matrix comes back into the dining room, leans against a wall, then puts his hand down to his wound. The red spotch is larger and wetter than before. 
 350 Up ahead in the distance, Bennett RACES the jeep toward the dock. 
'S P.O.V. 352 Bennett, now dragging Jenny along, has left the jeep and is running along the dock. They stop at Arius' war boat, Bennett cuts the moorings with his knife, then he FORCES Jenny into the boat. 
 353 Matrix nears the dock as Bennett tries to start the engines. The engines start to kick over, then stop. Matrix RACES onto the foot of the dock. Bennett desperately tries the engines again. They start! Matrix RACES toward the end of the dock. 
 354 Bennett edges the war boat away from the dock, then BLASTS the engines and RACES the boat away... 
 355 .just as Matrix reaches the end of the dock. 
'S P.O.V. 356 Matrix watches the boat RACE away with Jenny. 
 359 Cindy is RACING her seaplane toward the dock! 
 360 Cindy slows the seaplane as she passes the dock and Matrix grabs onto a ladder. 
 361 with Matrix hanging onto the ladder, Cindy BLASTS the throttle and RACES after Bennett's boat. 
 362 As the seaplane starts to GO FASTER, Matrix holds onto the ladder and looks at Bennett's boat up ahead. 
'S P.O.V. 363 Bennett's boat is about FORTY YARDS ahead of the seaplane. 
 366 The wind and spray SLAP against Matrix as he watches the seaplane closing the gap on the boat. He climbs from the ladder onto the wing of the plane, the propellers only about five feet away from him. He CRAWLS along the wing of the plane, the wind WHIPPING at him. 
'S P.O.V. 371 Matrix tries to aim the gun through the sight, but the bouncing of the seaplane, the bouncing of the boat, and Jenny's nearness to Bennett makes a shot too risky. 
 372 Matrix lowers his gun. 
 BLAM! BLAM'. 
 INSERT - SIGN 382 A large sign on the beach reads "DANGER - U.S. COAST 
 
 ! 1 He drops the gun on the floor of the boat. The boat is JUST ABOUT TO HIT THE BEACH! Matrix SMASHES Bennett's face with his fist, KNOCKING him down onto the floor near Jenny. Cont. 
 Commence target practice... The guns begin to fire their salvos. 
 
 CLOSEUP - BENNETT 390 A CLOSEUP of Bennett shows him REACTING disorientedly to the SOUND, SMOKE AND FLASH of the explosion. 
 391 Bennett and Matrix have their faces pressed to the dirt as a mortar shell EXPLODES near their heads. Bennett gets up, wildly looks around, then maniacally FIRES his submachine gun, KILLING three young children running scared across a Val Verde field. Matrix rises and SMASHES his rifle butt into Bennett's face. 
 Let her go, Bennett and I'll give you a chance to twist that knife into me. The stern of the boat continues to burn as Bennett considers what Matrix said. 
 Just what I thought, Bennett, you're still a yellow chicken-shit. Bennett's eyes fill with hate. More shells EXPLODE nearby. 
 
 (SCREAMS) Throw the gun away, Matrix!! Cont. 
 393 Matrix takes his knife out of his wrist sheath and meets Bennett on the sand in front of the boat. 
 You're dead... He feints the knife toward Matrix. 
 .and so is she. 
 395 Jenny watches the fight in horror. 
 
 (INTO MIKE) Stop that shelling NOW! 
 399 Jenny, watching the fight, notices Matrix's gun on the beach near her and hesitates to pick it up. 
 
! Matrix's eyes go glassy, then he drops his knife. Bennett lets Matrix's wrist go, looks at Matrix's glassy eyes for a beat, then he pulls his knife out of Matrix's side. Matrix STAGGERS for a beat, then STUMBLES a few steps and drops to one knee against the front outside hull of the boat. Bennett slowly approaches Matrix from behind, casually feeling the blade of his knife. He looks at Matrix's wide, unprotected back and Bennett smiles. Bennett pulls the knife back with his arm, preparing to plunge it into Matrix's back. 
 Fuck you, asshole... He PLUNGES the knife down toward Matrix's back. Matrix moves LIKE LIGHTNING to the side. The knife misses him and GETS STUCK in the hull of the boat. Matrix turns toward Bennett. 
 (shaking his head) No... Bennett tries desperately to get his knife unstuck from the boat hull, but he can't. Fear FLOODS his eyes. Matrix moves close to Bennett. 
 Fuck YOU, asshole... He DRIVES his knife into Bennett's throat so hard the knife goes through Bennett's neck and comes out the other side. Still holding the knife, Matrix then DRIVES the knife into the hull of the boat. The knife STICKS into the hull, holding Bennett's neck there like a thumbtack holds a note on a bulletin board. BOOM? Suddenly there is another, larger EXPLOSION in the fiery back of the boat and the whole boat EXPLODES into FLAMES, leaving Bennett lost in the fireball. 
 I wanted to shoot...but I couldn't, I just couldn't. Matrix looks at her. Cont. 
 You know something? I'm glad you couldn't. He takes the gun from her and tosses it past the burning boat into the ocean. 
'S P.O.V. 404 He sees two Army helicopters approaching from the air and Cindy bringing her seaplane to the beach. 
 I just saw what's left of Arius' estate... You're the best I've ever known, John... I've saved a place for you if you want to join up with me again. Matrix notices as Cindy joins Jenny standing next to him. Matrix looks at the two of them, then up at Kirby. 
 This was the last one... The corpsmen carry Matrix into the copter and Jenny joins him inside. Kirby and Cindy watch him from outside the chopper. 
 What about your identities... Don't you need two more? 
 No... Cont.

 "RED DRAGON" 
 July 20, 1984 
 I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here... 
 I don't want to talk about it anywhere. (beat) If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon. 
 How much do you know? 
 What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' (beat) Confessions? 
 Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. (beat) None of them knew that; 
 What else did you keep out of the papers? 
 Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive. 
 Somebody hurt him? 
 Typed him from semen. He's a secretor. 
 Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago... 
 And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors. 
 You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack. 
 Last two like this we had, you caught. 
 That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing. 
 That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think. 
 I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think. (beat) I came down here to get away from all that. 
 You look all right now. 
 I am all right. 
 If you can't look anymore, I understand... 
 As long as they're dead... 
 These are all dead, Will. 
 
 (O.S.) Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat. 
 (O.S.) I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect 
 What did he want? 
 And you said? 
 I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma? (sarcastic) I got a diploma and everything. 
 We have it good, don't we? 
 What the hell can I do? 
 If I were? 
 (touches the side of her face) I don't care. (beat> He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence. 
 Will it keep them out? 
 Yeah. .. 
 How many turtle eggs you think are in here? 
 In this hatchery? Forty to fifty. 
 Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh? 
 Yeah, but not now.. These will all make it... guaranteed. 
 I have to. 
 Because it's his bad luck to be special. 
 Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it... 
 Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you? 
 I'LL try to keep him as far away from it as I can... 
 (distant) Thanks for the lift. 
 I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone. 
 That's right. 
 There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for They transferred the home movies of both families once half-inch VHS. 
 (getting out) Thanks. 
 GRAHAM'S FEET 
 
 WIDER - GRAHAM moves into the room. The bloodstains are extensive. Half the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock. The mirrors are smashed. Taped outlines on the mattress indi- cate where the bodies had been found. Graham opens the file he carries containing autopsy, lab and crime reports. 
 intruder entered through kitchen sliding door. Probably a glass cutter. Why didn't he care that he left AB saliva on the glass? it was hot out that night. inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him. (beat) The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs. Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was rising... Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation... increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates... she lived at least five minutes after she was shot... All her other injuries were post-mortem. (beat> Then he went toward the children's room. (beat) Direction and velocity of blood stains on the east wall indicate arterial spray.;. With his throat cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight. Because the intruder was moving to the children's room... (beat) in the children's room the intruder shot the first boy in bed. Second boy was found in bed, but dustballs indicate he was dragged out from under his bed to be shot... (MORE) 
 GRAHAM (CONT'D) (beat) Profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained... as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leed's chest, believed to be post-mortem. What did the killer do with them after they were dead? And before he put the boys back in their beds? 
 There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch. There's a doghouse in the back yard. Where's the dog? 
 #1 ...like to rip me off a piece of that! 
 #2 Fuck her 'til her nose bleeds. 
 
 #2 
 #1 What the fuck are you lookin' at? 
 
 (into the tape recorder) When they were dead -- except possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he used later on Mrs. Leeds... What did he do in the interval? Struggling with Mr. Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute. What else? (beat) Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead? 
 (into phone) Molly? 
 It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. (beat) I love you... 
 (into tape recorder) You moved the kids after you killed them, didn't you? Did you arrange them for your performance with Mrs. Leeds on their bed? Did you tie Mr. Leeds sitting up in bed? That's the postmortem ligature on his chest. Did you make them your audience? Did you open their eyes? There is something you can't afford for me to know about. Isn't there? Mrs. Leeds was lovely, wasn't she? It was maddening to have to wear gloves when you touched her, wasn't it? (beat) There was talcum powder on her leg. There was no talcum powder in the bathroom. (beat) The powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off 
?! 
 
 Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints? 13. 
 (V.O.) He's working on the single print index. What time is it? 
 (V.O.) You said the guy down here is good. 
 He is good. Bur not as good as Price. 
 (V.O.) What do you want to do? 
 Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. (heat) And dust all the corneas of all their eyes. 
 + SPRINGFIELD -DAY 
 Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything. 
 The report didn't mention nails and eyes. 
 Why do you think he took his gloves off? 
 Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you? 
 (sudden distaste) 'Intimate? !" 
 Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy. (beat) Everybody else was dead. 14. 
 All right. House to house interviews will be extended four additional blocks. R & I has loaned us two clerks to help cross-matching airline reservations between Birmingham last month and between Atlanta now. (beat) Dr. Princi. 
 DR. PRINCI This is what the subject's teeth look like. The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed them from the impressions we took of bite marks off the Leeds woman here and off the Jacobi woman last month in Birmingham. (beat) As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors -- the teeth here and here. 
 Investigator Graham has worked this kind of thing before. Can you add anything? 
 Can't hear you. Can you come up to the front? 
 He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse. 
 He only bit women so far, right? 
 That's all we know about. (MORE) 
 GRAHAM (CONT'D) (beat) Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. (beat) You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin... (beat) He bites a lot. 
 What's average? 
 Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds. 
 All right. Vice and Narcotics, take the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars. Marcus and Whitman heads up at the funeral. The rest of you, your assignments are on the sheet. Let's go. 
 One more thing: I've heard officers referring to the killer as the 'Tooth Fairy. (on laughter) Yeah, yeah, but I don't want to hear that in public or internal memoranda. That's it. 
 (to Crawford) We don't have shit, and we know it. 
 (to Graham) The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecter three years ago. (beat) He killed nine people, didn't he? 
 Nine that we know of. Two didn't die. 
 What happened to them? 
 One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver. 
 What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecter? 
 Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him. 
 What would you call him? 
 To yourself... 
 I call him a monster. 
 I understand he cut you pretty good... 
 (cold right turn> What about the dog? 
 It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl. 
 Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it? 
 No. 17. 
 Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog? 
 (alert) A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it. 
 Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it. 
 Yeah? (waits) Lemme put you on the speaker phone. 
 (V.O.) Who am I talking to? 
 Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and you got Will Graham here. 
 (V.O.) I got a partial with a tented arch that's probably a thumb print and a fragment of a palm. 
 (V.O.) Came off the oldest kid's left eye. It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound. 
 Can you make an identification off it? 
 (V.O.) Don't know. The palm came off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe. I want to work these up in my own darkroom. I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon. Hangs up. 
 thought Graham was ridiculous. Now his expression is very changed. 
 
 Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie Lounds? I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler. I did the paperback... ! 
 (running on, behind them) When did they call you in, Will? What have you got? 
 Lounds, give it a rest... 
 Come on, Graham?! Talk to me! 
 How does this guy compare with Lecter? How does he do them? 
 
 (very low) Keep the fuck away from me! 
 (over his shoulder to Lounds) Get the hell away from here, Lounds! CUT TO: INT. DINER, BOOTH - GRAHAM + - DAY Graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee. Crawford is looking at him. Finally: 
 ...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls... 
 I know... 
 (back to business) Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index. 
 Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you? 
 I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me. 
 You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print. .. 
. Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right? (pause) We'll get him one way or the other. 
 What's one way? 
 We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever... (beat) If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him. 
 We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack. (beat) What's the other? 
 He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time. 
 No other possibilities? 
 You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about. (MORE) 21. 
 GRAHAM (CONT'D) (beat) The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop. 
 Why? 
 Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack. 
 See? You do know something about him. 
 (long stare at Crawford; then) ... I'm going to see Lecter. 
 For Christ's sake, why? 
 (matter-of-fact) To recover the mind set. 
 Hey, baby! Where are you? 
 None you'd notice. I'm lonely... 
 Tell me about yourself. 
 (laughs) Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff. (beat) How's Kevin? 
 Eating junk food. (beat) They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it... 
 Z don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon. 
 I have to see somebody. 
 (coming back) Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow. 
 Blue, then. 
 Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit- brown for all I care... (beat) Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and... 
 Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby. .. 
 I love you... 
 DR. CHILTON Dr. Bloom called me yesterday, Mr. Graham. Or should I call you Dr. Graham? 
 (O.S.) I'm not a doctor. (beat) I need to see Lecter in as much privacy as possible. 24. TWO SHOT Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. He appears repressed, clamped down. Dr. Chilton is a sincere Chief of Staff, but not gifted. 
 DR. CHILTON Dr. Lecter will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside. 
 I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him. 
 DR. CHILTON As long as it's on soft paper. You may(Pause) find this curious. 
 DR. CHILTON Here Lecter's resting on the examining table getting an electrocardiogram. Complained of chest pains. Pulse seventy-two. Here he grabs the nurse's head and pulls her down to him. Here he's subdued by the attendant and Lecter's shoulder is dislocated. Do you notice the strange thing? (pause) His pulse never got over eighty- five. Even when he tore into her face. 
 DR. CHILTON The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him? 
 No. 
 DR. CHILTON When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him? 
 DR. CHILTON 
 (stands) I want to see Lecktor now. 
 DR. CHILTON Uh... sure... 
 That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago. 
 I keep getting it for Christmas. 
 Did you get my card? 
 I got it. Thank you. 26. 
' S struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his emotional reactions. 
 And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement. 
 Stuart is fine. 
 Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will? 
 No. 
 Of course, you don't. (pause) I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot. 
 Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry. 
 And? 
 Very interesting, even to a layman. 
 A layman.., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it' 
 You've read the transcript. It's all there. 
 No it's not. Do you know how you Did it Will? 
 It's in the transcript. What does it matter now? 
 (smiles) It doesn't matter to me, Will. 
 I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor. 
 Yes, I thought so. 
 It's about Atlanta and Birmingham. 
 Yes . 
 You read about it, I'm sure. 
 In the papers. I don't rear out the articles. (laughs) I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you? 
 I thought you would have some ideas. 
 Why should I tell you? 
 There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...? 
 Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. (laugh;) He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground. I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face. (beat) Never mind, it's boring. 
 You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason. 
 Pray tell. 
 I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for. 
 Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me. 
 No. I knew that I'm nor smarter than you are. 
 Then how did you catch me, Will? 
 You had disadvantages. 
 What disadvantage?. 
 You're insane. 
 You're very tan, Will. 
 Your hands are rough. They don't look like a cop s hands anymore. That shaving lotion is something a child would select. It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it? 
 Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity. 
 I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best... 
 (interrupts) Do you have the file with you 
 Yes. 
 Pictures? 
 Yes. 
 let me have them,, and I might consider it. 
 No. 
 Do you dream much, Will? 
 Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor. 
 You haven't threatened to take away my books yet. 
 let me have the file. Then I'll tell you what I think. 
 sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees: 
 DR. LECKTOR 
 (O.S.) There is a very shy boy, Will. 
 
 What were the yards like? 
 Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why? 
 Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing. 
 That's interesting. 
 It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before. 
 Yes. I'd considered it. 
 You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you? 
 I want your opinion. 
 I don't have one right now. 
 When you do have one I'd like to hear it. 
 May I keep the file? 
 I haven't decided yet. 
 I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number? 
 No. 
 Do you know how you caught me, Will? 
 Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file. 
 Do you know how you caught me? 
 (O.S.) The reason you caught me, Will, is: we're just alike. You want the scent? Smell yourself. 
 Mr. Dollarhyde? 
 CLOSER - DOLLARHYDE 
 Yes, Eileen. 
 
 And? 
 On the densitometer it came out within tolerances. 
 Thank you, Eileen. 
 Thank you so much. I'll call you when I'm finished. 
 
 Can I have the number of Dr. Sidney Bloom, University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry, please? (beat) Thank you. (dials again) Dr. Sidney Bloom, please. 
 (V.O.) He's not in today, bur I'll connect you with his office... 
 What's his secretary's name again...? 
 (V.O.) Linda King. Just a moment. 
 (V.O.) Linda King's desk. 
 Hi, Linda. .. 
 (V.O.) Linda doesn't come in nights. 36. 
 Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number. 
 (V.O.) She'll be in, in the morning... 
 I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me. 
 (V.O.) She doesn't have a Rolodex. 
 (smiling) I'LL bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone. 
 (V.O.) Yeah. .. 
 Well, zip that little Pointer right on down to the letter G. 
 (V.O.) Okay. 
 We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Ms. Will Graham. 
 (V.O.) Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C. 
 Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too 
 (V.O.) (beat) 3680 DeSote Highway. Marathon, Florida. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Clears the trays. 
 
 (reverb, distant) Block her off, Mitch... 
 
 
 GRAHAM'S EYES In horror. And O.S., we hear SCREAMING coming from a differ- ent place as we... CUT TO: 
 
 
 It was last Thursday. This couple from Duluth. I had them down to the short strokes talking mortgages -- I mean, that man could have written a check for the whole goddamn place. I'm figuring: Geehan , you lucky sonofabitch, you gonna unload this turkey. (beat) Then the squad car rolls up. They ask a coupla questions. The good officers give them the whole fuckin' guided tour. Who was laying where. Where all the blood sprayed... terrific! (beat) Off they go in their Sedan DeVille the hell out of here. 
 Have any single men asked to look at it? 
 Haven't asked me. (beat) Took four coats of interior latex, five in places. (pause) You can drop that key in the mailbox. You don't have to come back by, do you? 
 Uh-uh. 
 WIDE - GRAHAM 
 
 
 REARSHOT: GRAHAM 
 
 
 
 
 A 
 
 
 (mumbling to himself) ... after you killed the cat and threw it into the yard, my man, you climbed up hero and waited. You used a cutting tool on these branches so you could see. (MORE) 
 GRAHAM (CONT'D) You watched the children and passed the time whittling and dreaming. (beat) When night came, you saw them passing their bright windows and you watched the shades go down, and you saw the lights go out one by one. And after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you? (shouts) DIDN'T YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU WATCHED THEM ALL GODDAMN DAY LONG! ! (beat) That's why you like houses with big yards, the easier to see them 
 
 They don't build houses this way anymore: solid lath and plaster construction. None of your drywall stuff and aluminum studs here. No sirree Bob! 
 I like it, hon. 
 Let's go to your office and see if we can work out some terms... 
 Great. You goin' love this house! 
 
 I'm sending the can to Jimmie Price to dust for prints. (fast beat) I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving. Then I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section out here on the severed branch. I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used. 
 Is it weird? 
 (V.O.) The mark? Yes. 
 If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley... 
 (V,O.) Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds? 
 SARAH                            CRAWFORD (fading up)                      (fading down) Special Agent Crawford's       No. The killer's not in office..                       the Single Print Index. He must never have been printed. 
 No, Mr. Graham is not in the office, bur let me... (beat) Wait, I'll be glad to... (beat) Yes, he'll be in the office later, but let me... 
 (to Graham) ... bur if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What? 
 He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."' 
 (to Graham) Will. Get right back here. He just called. 
 Who did he ask for? 
 (V.O.) You. 
 DR. BLOOM Anybody want the rest of the cholesterol special? 
 Thanks, no. 
 ...so how do I play him, Sidney? 
 DR. BLOOM Compliment him. Tell him most people don't have the intellectual capacity to understand what has happened, that sort of thing. (beat) If he's paranoid, play into his grievance. Let him air it. (beat) If he's picked you as an adversary and wants to gloat, give him what he's after. A little at a time. 
 ... very little. If it's all electronic switching we'll need a minute for the trace. 
 (into phone) Special Agent Crawford's office. (beat) Bill, call back on twenty-four four. We need to keep this line clear... 
. 
 Where the hell's Graham! 
 . 
 He went to the men's room. 
 . 
 For Christ's sake get him! 
 Special Agent Crawford's office. (she nods; it's him) Could you hold on a second, I'll see if I can find him. 
 (calm) This is Will Graham. Can I help you? 
 (V.O.) No. I can help you. 
 I don't understand. 
 (V.O.) Atlanta and Birmingham. 
 
 (O.S.) Do you know something about that? 
 (V.O.) Why do you think I called? 
 (O.S.) I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things . 
 Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you? 
 (V.O.) You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not. 
 Let's get straight who we've talking about. (beat) Are you the man I'm interested in? 
 (V.O.) I don't think I'll tell you. 
 He's right-handed. 
 (V.O.) Most people are. 
 He's misunderstood. 
 (V.O.) Cut the general crap. 
 He's very strong physically. 
 (O.S.) That's true. 
 He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet. 
 (O.S.) Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not. 
 I don't want to do that, 
 (O.S.) Goodbye. 
'S ecstatic . 2ND VOICE (V.O.) Who am I speaking to? 
 Will Graham, FBI. 
 You tell me. You have a man in custody? 
 (V.O.) Damn right. (beat) Freddie Lounds. 
 (V.O.) Can you hear me? (beat) Are you preferring charges against him or you want him to just run along... 
 (hollers) Yeah. I'm preferring charges! Obstruction of justice. You lock that asshole up. You hold him for the U.S. Attorney! You... 
 Will, listen... 
 DR. CHILTON Come in. 
 Dr. Chilton. 
 DR. CHILTON Yes? 
 When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.. We got him out of there and dug around... 
 DR. CHILTON (fast) Do you have it? 
 Yeah. It's right here. 
 DR. CHILTON 
 DR. CHILTON Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you? 
 No. 
 Special Agent Crawford's office. 
 Speak up, please. I can hardly hear you! 
 DR. CBILTON (V.O.) (shouting) I said I need to speak to Special Agent Crawford or Mr. Graham. Right away! 
 (holding one ear closed) I'm sorry. Special Agent Crawford and Graham are tied up tight now. Can I get them to call you back? 
 DR. CHILTON (V.O.) (going nuts) This is Dr. Chilton. At the Chesapeake Hospital. Will you please call them this is very, very urgent!! 
 (hollering) How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop? (beat) Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds! 
 (seeing Sarah) What is it? 
 It's a Dr. Chilton, sir. He says it's urgent. 
 It's Will Graham... 
 DR. CHILTON (V.O.) Well, it's about goddamn time! I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and.... 
 Where did you get it?! 
 DR. CHILTON (V.O.) From Hannibal Lecktor's cell. It was hidden in a book. 
 (to Lounds) Run along to the police station, Freddie. We'll talk to you when we get around to it... 
 (V.O.) Can you read it to me? 
 DR. CHILTON It's written on toilet tissue. (reads ) 'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming. (reads ) 'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming. Just as the source of light is burning. (beat) Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched our, then it says... (reads) 'I have a complete collection of your press notices. f think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate. Investigator Graham interests me. Very purposeful locking. I hope we can correspond. (beat) There's another piece missing here. I'LL read the bottom part. (reads ) 'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet. Signed: Avid Fan. (to Graham) It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom. 
 
 Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes. (punches into Dr. Chilton's line) Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up. 
 After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. (beat) Where's Lector now? 
 DR. CHILTON (V.O.) In a holding cell. 
 How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious? 
 DR. CHILTON (V.O.) Three, four hours. 
 Have your building superintendent shut off the water and most of the lighting in Lecktor's hall. Have him walk through carrying tools and being pissed off or something, 
 DR. CHILTDN (V.O.) Yes. We can manage all that. 
 (hits another line) Brian. We have a note coming in on the fly. Possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number one priority., It has to go to Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints and Documents. Graham and I will be walking it through... 
 - 
 One hair, Graham. Maybe a thirty- second of an inch. A couple of blue grains. I'll work it up. What else have you got? 
 Hair from Lecktor's comb. Whiskers from an electric razor they let him use. This is hair from the cleaning man. 
 (O.S.) Perspiration stains, nothing else. (beat) How many guys handled this without gloves ? 
 (O.S.) The cleanup man and Lecktor... 
 (O.S.) The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers. But the others... (beat) I could fume it, Will, but couldn't guarantee the iodine stains would fade our in the time you've got to get it back. 
 (O.S.) Ninhydran? Boosted with heat? 
 (O.S.) No. We couldn't wash it after. I can't get a print off this, Will. There isn't one. 
 (O.S.) Dammit. 
 (without looking up) How long do I have? 
 Twenty minutes max. 
 The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply. 
 That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out. (beat) At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins . (beat) It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away. 
 (O.S.) He doesn't have anything to cut with. 
 
 (O.S.) Now we can mash it a little. 
 
 (chants under his breath) You're so sly, but so am I... 
 
 
 (O.S.) Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't... 
 (O.S.) That could be the tip of a 't. Here and here. And here. 
 (O.S.) At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r. 
 We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it... 
 
 Personal ads? 
 The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now. 
 When do they go to press? 
 In thirty-five minutes. 
 Christ! 
 After we find Lecktor's response, we substitute our own. Somewhere tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will actually buy Tattler, looking for Lecktor's message. Here's what he'll find, Bill. 
 (reads ) 'Dear Avid Fan: inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements. Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central. Left luggage 72683. 
 It's a Secret Service letter drop and stakeout. He shows: we take him. (beat) Anything from Chicago? 
 Not yet. 
 Let's get to the physical. 
 There was no print. I'm here for kicks . 
 One whisker. Scale counts and core size match Hannibal Lecktor's. So does color. The color's different than the Tooth Fairy's taken in Birmingham and Atlanta. Three blue grains and some dark flecks went to Brian's end. 
 The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine. Must be from the cleaning man. There are several particles of dried blood. Not enough to type. 
 Bowman? 
 It's Snow White toilet paper. National distribution. 
 (beat) If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy... (beat) He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions. We can make out: 'six-six-six'. (beat) I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it. 
 Issue the toilet paper tear as a... 
 (V.O.) This is Chester here. Who am I talking to? 
 Will Graham, Jack Crawford... 
 (V.O.) We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now. 
 Read it. 
 (V.O.) (reads) 'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.' 
 That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me... 
 (V.O.) 'You're very beautiful. 
 Christ... 
 (V.O.) 'I offer one hundred prayers for your safety. Find help in john 6:22, 8:16 9:1;Luke l:7, 3:1; Galatians 6:11. 15:2; Acts 3:3; Revelations 18:i; Jonah 6:8... (beat) It's signed: 'Bless you, 6:6:6' 
 (checks watch) ... twenty-eight minutes. (low to Sarah) Cryptography at Langley? 
 They got shot a Telex. They're on if now... 
 
 (to Graham) No. (beat) The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code. (beat) And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him. 
 Book code? 
 'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book? 
 Not the Bible? 
 No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible. 
 Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out. 
 Right . (beat) What about sweating Lecktor? 
 They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. (beat) He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip. 
 it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell. 
 He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor... 
 Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place... 
 Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books... 
 Where? 
 Library of Congress. 
 Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time. 
 (looks at watch) We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week. 
 Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper? 
 Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says. 
 And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon . 
 It's your call, Will. What do we do? 
 Run it. 
 What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write? 
 We will feel sick for a very long time. 
 PROFILE: GRAHAM 
 Who is it? 
 (V.O.) Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now. 
 What'd it say? 
 (V.O.) I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you. 
 Tell me now. 
 (V.O.) It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all. (beat) It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address. 
 Get me a plane... 
 (V.O.) Wait, Will... 
 Get me a plane! 
 (V.O.) I'll pick you up in... 
 I won't be here. 
 
 Mom. .. 
 Mom, someone's outside. There's noises ... 
 (O.S.) Mom? 
 (O.S.) Mom? 
 
 Are you all right, ma'am? 
 
 
 Holiday Inn decor. 
 ...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you. 
 It's a precaution... (to Kevin) Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float. 
 I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom... 
 (to Molly) What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?' (beat) He read the Tattler piece, didn't he? 
 Good for him. (beat) Thanks a lot, Freddie! (to Kevin) Kevin. We're going grocery shopping . 
 Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom? 
 No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are. 
 Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true? 
 Yes . 
 I figured I'd ask you... 
 
 I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it. (beat) This guy wants to kill you? 
 We don't know that. 
 Are you gonna kill him? 
 No. It's just my job to find him. (beat) I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs. 
 How did it happen? 
 Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them. 
 How? 
 With a knife. 
 GRAHAM (CONT'D) (beat) I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was.., peculiar. (beat) I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying. (beat) I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait . 
 You went in the apartment? 
 Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him. 
 I kept thinking there must be some way I could have handled it better. It kept replaying in my mind. Later I got depressed. A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked me to go into a hospital. After a while I got some distance on it and was okay. 
 Did the girl die? 
 No. 
 She got all right? 
 ...after a while. 
 And Hobbs died? 
 (nods) 
 Killing somebody feels that bad? 
 Kevin: it's the ugliest thing in the world. 
 What kind of coffee do you like? 
 Huh? 
 You like that Colombian stuff, don't you? 
 Mom likes that, too. 
 MOLLY - NIGHT 
 Slick as hell. 
 I remember. 
 Yes. I said this is too good to live... 
 I need to talk to you about Will Graham. 
 What about him? 
 I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature. 
 Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now. 
 That was Peterson upstairs. 
 It was you who did the asking. 
 He doesn't think you run mind games on him. 
 I wouldn't presume to try. 
 You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on- one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic? 
 He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.   But I don't think he's psychic.   What he has it empathy and projection  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him. 
 Why aren't you ever alone with him? 
 Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked. (beat) So do I. (beat) What do you want? 
 His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate? 
 I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in... 
 That's when it happened? 
 No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box. When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy? ' (beat) That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown. 
 What's the bottom line? 
 If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself. (beat) What are you planning, Jack? 
 Could he handle a direct contact? 
 I don't recommend it. 
 (O.S.) You don't recommend what, Sidney? 
 Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea. 
 If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot. (MORE) 
 GRAHAM (CONT'D) (beat) That's what you were thinking, isn't it? 
 I'll use Lounds. 
 Sidney, he doesn't read the "Sunday Times literary supplement. He reads Lounds in the "Tattler." (beat) And I want this over with... Fast. 
 I believe he's socially maladjusted. Laughed at by his contemporaries... 
 How does he rate compared to Dr, Hannibal Lecktor? 
 He's not as intelligent. 
 (to Bloom) What have we missed? 
 He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead. I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr, Leeds. 
 The killer has sexually molested all his male victims. He is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the opposite sex. (beat) Our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been the product of an incestuous home life . (added afterthought) And probably had sexual relations with his mother... 
 How long will you stay in Washington? 
 Until we've taken out the Tooth Fairy. 
 All right. Let's shoot the pictures . 
 (to Crawford) I want shots with me and Graham together . 
 C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. You want this to look real, don't you? 
 Keep the motel sign across the street just slightly out of focus. He has to be able to read it, but it can't look too obvious. 
 (low) Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah-jongg piece. (beat) It means Red Dragon. (beat) That mean anything to you? 
 No. 
 ...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear? 
 Pretty well. 
 I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us. (beat) They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog. 
 GI(AHAM Yes . 
 Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them? 
 Glaser Safety Slugs? 
 (nods ) ... commercially prohibited. (beat) Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads. Body armor? 
 Kevlar Second Chance. 
 I hope you have a second chance... 
 Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times' 
 You got it. 
 Let's walk the route. 
 
 (without looking) What is it? 
 (O.S.) A "Tattler." 
 You'll have to wait until I bust a bundle. 
 (O.S.) Now. 
 (hot) I said wait 'til I bust a bundle. Understand? 
 Hey. Hey you. 
 Me? 
 Yeah, you. Fuckin' told you... 
 (interrupting) You told me what? 
 You told me what?! 
 You got a quarter comin' back.

 It was a mistake . Sorry we... 
 'Sorry' yo' mama!! 
 Hold on! We thought you were someone we're trying to catch... 
 (backs up) Hold onto this!! (grabs his groin) I get dat cannon stuck up mah face?! Car dirt splattered up and down mah Calvin Kleins?! 
 See you, Freddie. 
 
 (O.S.) Are you cold? Would you like a blanket? 
 Was I in an accident? 
 (O.S.) No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine. 
 My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned. 
 (O.S.) Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back. 
 Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth. 
 What am I doing here? 
 (O.S.) Atoning, Mr. Lounds. 
 (O.S.) Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds? 
 I don't want to know. 
 (O.S.) According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said. (beat) You know now, don't you? 
 Yes . 
 (O.S.) Do you feel privileged? 
 I'm very scared. 
 (O.S.) Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds? 
 Yes . 
 (O.S.) Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds? 
 I don't know... 
 (O.S.) In a little while I'll help you understand. 
 (O.S.) I'll be right back. (singsong) Don't... go away... 
 I'd do a big story. Anything you want to say. Describe you any way you want or no description! 
 (O.S.) Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds. 
 No. I don't want to see you. 
 (O.S.) Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter. You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead. 
 (O.S.) (singsong) Well: here...I...am... 
 (O.S.) Oh my dear God Jesus. 
 
 Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun. Do you see? 
 Yes ... 
 Do you see? 
 Yes . 
 Do you see? 
 Yes.

 Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see? 
 Yes . 
 Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. (as Lounds nods) The Dragon rampant. Do you see? 
 Yes . 
 Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. 
 Oh, God. 
 Do you see? 
 Please, no. 
 'No' what? 
 Not me. 
 Are you a man? 
 Yes. 
 Do you imply that I'm a queer? 
 God, no. 
)E Are you queer, Mr. Lounds? 
 No. 
 Before me you are a slug in the sun. You are privy to a great becoming and you recognize nothing. You are an ant in the afterbirth. (beat) It is your nature to do only one thing correctly: tremble. Bur fear is not what you owe me. Lounds: you and the others, YOU OWE ME AWE! (long pause) We have one more piece of work to do. 
 (to himself) Didn't take off the mask. Please, God, let him not take off the mask. If he comes back with it off, I'm dead... 
 DOLLARHME'S HAND 
 (O.S.) Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds. 
 Now you will read this into the tape recorder. 
 
 'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand. (beat) 'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you. (beat) 'I will be a testament to the truth, now. About his work. About his becoming.' 
 DOLLARHYDE'S HAND turns off the tape recorder. 
 You did very well.   I apologize for the crude images.    Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights . 
 You'll let me go now? 
 You will tell the truth? 
 Absolutely, 
 Good . (beat) We'll seal your promise with... 
 DOLLARHYDE'S FACE, 
 ... with a kiss. 
 Go 'head and kill 'ee, you 'astard! You rot in 'ell. rot in 'ell! 
 
 (surprised) You haven't smoked in two years. 
 No. 
 I wanted it over fast. (beat) It felt dirty to not tell you. 
 No. 
 Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time. 
 I have to go back to Birmingham. 
 No. I have to be. in there... alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks. 
 You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while. (beat) I'll come and get you afterwards... 
 Molly. (pause) … I love you. And I'm not really going to be fit to be with for awhile... 
 Sidney: I don't understand him. We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience. To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming' ...but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming. (beat) The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me. why the mirrors? 
 (V.O.) The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them. I don't have an answer for you. (beat) Listen to me, my friend: leave this. 
 And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home? (beat) This ends when I make it over. 
 (V.O.) How are Molly and the boy? 
 Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana. (beat) Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...! 
 
 (V.O.) (ansaphone recording ) 'Hello. This is Valerie Leeds. I'm sorry I can't come to the phone right now ... 
 I'm sorry, too... 
 Excuse me...? 
 Coffee ... 
 It's just YOU and me now, sport. And I'd better hurry up and find you. (beat) Because I'm losing all this... 
 Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock. 
 REBA (WOMAN) Put your back against the doer. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile an your feet and there will be a stool just to your left. 
 Can you give me an idea of the conditions... 
 Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights. 
 What's being photographed? 
 The activities of nocturnal animals. 
 When do you need it? 
 In eight days. 
 Let me stick this in the black hole. 
'S 
 The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code . (beat) It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do? 
 It'll do fine. 
, 
 Reba, dear, I've got to fly. (beat) Mr. Dollarhyde, if it wouldn't be too much trouble could you help her home ? 
 I can 'help' myself home, Ralph... 
 I'LL take you. 
 (standing close) No, thanks. I manage very well. (beat) I'LL order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow. 
 Ride with me. 
 Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time. 
 Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to. 
 It's better if I rake your arm. 
 Come on in. (beat) How about a gin and tonic? 
 Tonic will be fine. 
 In the kitchen. 
 How did you come to Gateway? 
 They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract. 
 You worked out well. 
 You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children... 
 
 
 I'll probably go back to it someday. 
 Uh-huh. 
. If you don't want to talk. okay. Bur I hope you will... because I like what you say. 
 May I touch your face? (as Dollarhyde reacts) I want to know if you're smiling or frowning. I want to know if I should just shut up or not... 
 REBA' S HAND 
 
 Take my word for it that I'm... smiling . 
 If I've offended you, I didn't mean to. 
 I have to go now. 
 REARSHOT: GRAHAM 
 :1(O.S.) What's he doin'? Been in there all day . 
 :2 (O.S.) Just sits and stares at the stuff... 
 Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is? 
 It's a surprise. 
 Francis? We're at the zoo...! 
 DR. WARFIELD In two days we're going to cap his tooth. Can you smell him? 
 (aglow) Yes! 
 DR. WARFIELD Are you apprehensive? Your protective and muscular gentleman over there is watching us like a cat. 
 No, no! I want to. 
 DR. WARFIELD All right, put your left hand on the edge of the table and you can explore with your right. I'll be right here beside you.

 I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa... 
 
 
 REBA'S HAND moves along the back of the sofa to Dollarhyde. 
 
 (soft whisper) Take me upstairs... 
 (O.S.) Let me get them off... it's torn... I don't care! Come on. My God, man. Yes ... 
 (O.S.) You're so sweet, D... (heat ) let me come up to you and take it... (beat) Yes... 
 (O.S.) (soft) Your heart is loud. (beat) Feel all of me 
 
 
 (O.S.) Is that you. D? 
 Yes, are you okay...?! 
 (O.S.) I'm fine. 
 
 
 Good morning... (kisses his cheek) If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee... 
 No! Don't go back into the house... (to Reba's quizzical reaction) it's too nice outside. 
 My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too? 
 I have work to do at the plant. 
 I'll get my purse. 
 I'll get it. (leaving) Stay right here. You lock very good in the sun... 
 Do you want a Coke or something, Reba? 
 I'm fine, Francis. 
 Fill it up and check the oil, please.

 (cocky) You don't like it? You know what you can do about it... 
 REBA'S FACE 
 
 
 
 I ought to jam this in your chest, and drain your heart... 
 (V.O.) You got the message Lecktor called... 
 I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes. 
 (V.O.) From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning. 
 What's it narrow down to? 
(V.O.) Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, Sr. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit. 
 (laughs ) That's narrow? 
 (V.O.) When are you coming back? 
 When I'm done. 
 It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson? 
 (V.0.) Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet. (beat) On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he? 
 Sure he is. Blond. (fuck him:) Probably Scandinavian, too... 
 (V.O.) You going back down to Florida after? 
 Yes. Is Molly there? 
 (V.O.) My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat. I'11 bet he's gained ten pounds. (beat) Molly's out in the motor home... 
 I know... 'Out in the good air...' 
 (V.O.) What's that? 
 Tell her I called. 
 This is Will Graham. Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk with Dr. Lecktor . 
 (V.O.) I'll put you through. 
 I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are. Will. 
 What do you want? 
 You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court. 
 I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it. 
 I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us. Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it? 
 Fight what? 
 When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good? (ironic) And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time! 
 I don't believe in God. 
 You should, Will. God's terrific! (beat) He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were grovelling to Him and singing a hymn. Don't you think that felt good? (beat) He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders. 
 Why does it feel good? 
 It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful... 
 (fading) God's a champ! He got a hundred and sixty Philippines in one plane crash two months ago... Remember the big earthquake in Italy last spring...? 
 (O.S.) I enter. The glass cutter. I lick the suction cup. The piece of glass I take out is mine. House is mine . (beat) I walk up these stairs. I pass childrens' toys. The children mean nothing to me... 
 (O.S.) I am soundless. I move to the door. I step into the room... 
 I see you there. I breathe in the perfume of this room. I am in the inner sanctum of a life. You will accept me. Take me into you. 
 (O.S.) You will be better than anything... anything I have ever known. As I see me in your eyes.., as I see me accepted there. Reflected there in mirrors . (beat) And you, you are the fuel for my changing... as this event becomes one more step towards what I am becoming that is different than what I have ever been before... (beat) As I see me, accepted by you, in the silver mirrors of your eyes... 
 
 (O.S.) THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU. THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S. 
 No. 
 (O.S.) 
 No! 
 (O.S.) SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR... 
. Shut up. Stop. Stop it. 
 (O.S.) YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH! 
 I want her! I want her alive... I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!! 
 
 Reba ... 
 (V.O.) Francis? Where are you? 
 The developing room. (beat) I need to... see you. 
 (V.O.) I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over? 
 (into phone) No. Reba...? 
 (V.O.) (phone filter) Are you okay...? 
 (into phone; getting control) I'll see you later. All right? 
 (V.O.) (phone filter) You'll come by? 
 (into phone) Yes . 
 
 There's something on your face. 
 
 What was it? 
 Pollen . 
 Thanks for the ride. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 walks back to his car. We are TRACKING WITH Dandridge walk- ing past the hedges. An arm shoots out and turns Dandridge. Dollarhyde's hand clutches the whole of Dandridge's lower face from underneath his jaw. He starts crushing Dandridge's face. THREE soft POPS are from Dollarhyde's nine millimeter. He shot Dandridge three times in the heart. 
 Who is it? 
 (O.S.) It's me. 
 Who? 
 (O.S.) Me. 
 Francis.. .? 
 (O.S.) It's not Francis? (beat) No. Francis is gone. Francis is gone forever... 
 (O.S.) What's important? 
 GRAHAM + CRAWFORD 
 He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors. I didn't understand the mirrors before. (beat) It's very important. 
 'Changes?' 
 It's a word. Killing them... (beat) His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time. (beat) And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again... 
 VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what? 
 How do I know?! 
 He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses, (beat ) If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him. 
 There's no connection between the families. 
 There has to be. 
 (exasperated) There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times . 
 (suddenly calm) He's a very shy boy... 
 What? 
 Something Lecktor said. 
 Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it. You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh. .. 
 It's not over yet. 
 It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM. The full moon is tonight. 
 Will? 
 (explodes ) You wanna watch this or what?! 
 That's why the boltcutter. 
 What's that? 
 He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door? 
 Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed. 
 You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered? 
 He had to. 
 Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday party was April fourteenth. Sometime between April fourteenth and May third they changed the door. (beat) But you can't see either family's door from the street. He wouldn't know until he got to the house that the padlock wasn't there anymore... 
 (intently on the screen ) From the alley he couldn't have seen the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door . (MORE) 
 GRAHAM (CONT'D) There's a lattice porch back there, but he was ready with his glasscutter. (beat) So he was either casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough or... 
 It's getting late and... 
 (explodes) Don't talk to me!! 
 It's Graham. The Jacobi stuff is still in the storeroom? 
 (V.O.) Yeah. You know what time it is? 
 Have one of the guards down there call me. 
 (V.O.) If the guy's not asleep... 
 Do it. 
 
 (to himself) You knew that was the Jacobis' cat ... 
 (to himself) You brought a boltcutter... 'cause you thought there was a padlock... 
 (to himself) And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar... But you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?! 
 (to himself) See the woman? 
 The bloom on the woman. You can almost feel her.  You can see her again and again. Anytime you want. (beat) The doggy doesn't have a collar. But you know the Leeds' dog, don't you? (beat) And you know the Jacobi cat. And the padlock on the door and you know you need a boltcutter and every other goddamn thing 'cause... (shouts) YOU'VE SEEN THESE FUCKING FILMS! (beat) Haven't you, my man? 
 It's the guard in the storeroom. 
 (to Crawford) We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in. (beat) They're in the far corner of the room under the windows. 
 (into phone) There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows. 
 He found them... 
 (reads label) What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri. 
 (into phone) Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it? 
 (to Graham) No. It's Bob's Photo Store in... 
 Have him peel the top label back. 
 (into phone) See if there's another label underneath. 
 It does, doesn't it? 
 (punches another number) I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field. (bear ) At Meigs have them warn up and flight-prep the Gulf Stream. 
 ... You're scaring me with this. 
 (searching). Am I alone in this room? Are you here... (shrill) Why are you doing this?! 
 (O.S.) (even) Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta. Do you know what I'm talking about? 
 (O.S.) (in a low voice) Two groups of people were changed. Leeds. And Jacobi. The police think they were murdered. (beat) Do you know what they call the being that visited these people? You can say. 
 The Tooth... 
 (O.S.) (low) Think carefully and answer correctly. 
 It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon. 
 (O.S.) Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong. (beat) I AM THE DRAGON! (beat) Give me your hand. 
 Now you know how the Dragon kills... 
 (into radio phone) This is Jack Crawford, FBI. Who am I speaking to? 
 (V.O.) This is Chester Fogel. I'm the managing director at Gateway... 
 (into phone) All we know is this man owns a van and he works at Gateway. We have physical characteristics... 
 (V.O.) We have 516 employees here... (MORE) 
 FOGEL (V.O.)(CONT'D) Our computers aren't programmed to retrieve by physical characteristics. We'd have to re-program and... 
 Parking permits... 
 (into phone) Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van. 
 (V.O.) 'Employee facilities.' And we have special stickers for vans. (beat) There's... let's see... (beat) ... about 28, 29 van permits issued... 
 (into phone) Start feeding me names. 
 (O.S.) Run these names to your DMV for a driver's license check. Man we're after is blond, caucasian, twenty to forty, six feet tall, 180-225 pounds. (beat) First name... 
 (O.S.) ... Alvaro. A.L.V.A.R.O., first name Jose. 
 LT. FISK (into phone) No. Brown eyes, black hair. 
 (to Crawford) No. 
 (into phone) Next ... 
 LT, FISK (into phone; to Graham) No. 36 years old. Black... 
 -NIGHT 
 (into PA) Could you fasten your seat belts. We're on our final approach... 
 LT. PISK (V.O.) ...six foot, male caucasian, blond, violet eves 217 pounds, 38 years old... 
 (into phone) Put it through the datafax. Fast. 
 
 (into phone to Lt. Fisk) Route three, Chester, Missouri. Where is that? 
 LT. FZSK (V.O.) From the airport you're closer. We'll meet at the Hock Road off ramp, Highway 94. 
 (to Graham) Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit... 
 (re Dollarhyde) This is our boy...! 
 
'S 
 Meet point's up ahead! 
 Go on to the house. 
 Lt. Fisk said... 
 Go on to the house... 
 
 is staring at Graham's blankness. 
 Will…? 
 (sharp ) What? 
 You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us. 
 (O.S.) Cut across the field. (beat) Kill your lights. 
 
 
 (into radio) Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach. Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house. 
 How far away's the back-up? 
 Three minutes. 
 I'll cover the back. 
 Stay in the trees. 
 FRONTAL: GRAHAM 
 (resigned whisper into radio) There's somebody in the house, Jack… 
 (O.S.) (radio filter) Wait for the back-up! Will? 
 (whispers in radio) It's happening again, Jack... 
 (low) ... stop it. 
 WINDOW: GRAHAM 
 (roars) STOP IT!!! 
 WINDOW + GRAHAM -- his arms across his face and his body angled sideways -- CRASHES through the glass. 
 
 
 
 GRAHAM'S FACE 
'S 
 
 (into phone) Hello. 
 Mama was probably asleep. 
 Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer. (beat) I want to see you. 
 Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to... 
 Come home with me. 
 What's this Mama shit? 
 What's the problem, Molly? 
 Small difference: I'm not dead, yet . 
 They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you. But they don't want to see me... 
 Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick... 
 Yeah. That's great. A little time. (beat I tell you what, buckaroo... (beat) See you around. 
 Twenty-three twenty-six..- Twenty- three twenty-eight. Here you go. 
 (O.S.) Yes . 
 (to son) Cut out the basketball and go back to the algebra, 
 I'll get it. 
 
 
 
 What do you want? 
 Are you George Sherman? 
 Yes. Who are you? 
 My name's Will Graham. I... 
 (suddenly realizing who he is) Oh, Jesus... Come in. (to wife) Honey...! 
 No, that's okay... (pause) How are you? 
 We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay! (beat) That man, Crawford, called and... told me... (beat) ... how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something? 
 No, I'm okay. I just wanted to... (beat) ... stop by and... 
 I can't thank you enough, I.., 
 standing in awkward places. They ate nothing special. They are normal human beings living their lives. To Graham they are very special: they are alive. 
 I just wanted to stop by and... see you... I guess. That's all. 
 
 
 You got a deal...

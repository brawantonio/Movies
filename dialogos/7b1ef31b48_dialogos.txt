 I got...I got....I got.... (straining) ....the wind knocked out of me. 
 Human skull. 
 No way, buttwipe. I found it. It's mine. 
 Anyways, there's bones all over the place down here. 
 
 This is Captain Miles Cooles...we've got a rescue situation in progress... 
 
: 
 (over the chopper) Keep those people back. Get them out of here. 
 (to his men) Move them all back. (dogging Bronschweig) I sent four men down after the boy. They're not responding. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG 
 
 What about my men? 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG (brusquely) We're doing all we can. 
 We've evacuated the building and been through it bottom to top. No trace of an explosive device or anything resembling one. 
 S.A.C. Have you taken the dogs through? 
 Yes, sir. 
 S.A.C. Well, take them through again. 
 MULDER (FILTER) Where are you, Scully? 
 MULDER (FILTER) Did you find something? 
 MULDER (FILTER) What's wrong, Scully? 
 MULDER (FILTER) You're looking for a bomb. 
 MULDER (FILTER) I think they have that covered. 
 What happened to playing a hunch? 
 The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced... 
 What are we doing up here? It's hotter than hell. 
 
 How's that? 
 What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome. 
 (suddenly nervous) It's locked? 
 No you didn't. 
 Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully? 
 Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV? 
 Oh, come on. 
 MULDER (FILTER) Scully, I found the bomb. 
 MULDER (FILTER) I'm in the vending room. 
 Scully, get somebody to open this door. 
 SCULLY (FILTER) Nice try, Mulder. 
 Scully -- listen to me. It's in the coke machine. You've got about fourteen minutes to get this building evacuated. 
 MULDER (FILTER) Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven... 
 ...thirteen fifty six... 
 SCULLY (FILTER) Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there. 
 In ten minutes.....?! 
 S.A.C. Where is it? 
 Scully? 
 SCULLY (FILTER) Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it. 
 S.A.C. Go. 
 Tell me this is just soda pop in those canisters. 
 S.A.C. No. It's what it looks like. A big I.E.D. - ten gallons of astrolite. (studying the bomb) Okay, get everybody out of here and clear the building. 
 Somebody's got to stay with you -- 
 S.A.C. I gave you an order. Now get the hell out of here and evacuate the area. 
 S.A.C. I think so. 
 You've got about four minutes to find out if you're wrong. 
 S.A.C. Did you hear what I said? 
 Something's wrong. 
. 
 What's he doing? 
 Something's not right... 
 S.A.C. 
 
 (with darkest irony) Next time you're buying. 
 WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) In light of Waco, and Ruby Ridge... 
 WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) ...there is a heightened need at the Attorney General's office to place responsibility as early as possible. 
 ...for the catastrophic destruction of public property and the loss of life due to terrorist activities... 
 
 Many details are still unclear; some agents' reports have not been filed, or have come in sketchy, without a satisfactory accounting of the events that led to the destruction in Dallas. But we're under some pressure to give an accurate picture of what happened to the Attorney General, so she can issue a public statement. 
 RESUME A.D. CASSIDY 
 We now know that five people died in the explosion. Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud who was trying to defuse the bomb that had been hidden in a vending machine. Three firemen from Dallas, and a young boy. 
 Excuse me -- the firemen and the boy -- they were in the building? 
 Agent Mulder, since you weren't able to be on time for this hearing, I'm going to ask you to step outside so that we can get Agent Scully's version of the facts. So that she won't have to be paid the same disrespect. 
 We were told the building was clear. 
 You'll get your turn, Agent Mulder. Please step out. 
 A.D. 
 It does say there in your paperwork that we were the ones who found the bomb... 
 Thank you, Agent Mulder. We'll call you in shortly. 
 Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully. 
 About what? 
 -- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building. 
 She was with me. 
 You don't see what's going on here, do you? (off Mulder's look) There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job. 
 And they want to blame us? 
 Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred -- 
 (grasping the irony) But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't. 
 (reciting the dictum) -- if it looks bad, it's bad for the 
 -- 
 -- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this. 
 She's in there right now saying the same thing about you. 
 I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device. 
 Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back. 
 Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me. 
 They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them. 
 (beat) What? What are you talking about? 
 Why? 
 They were the ones that put us together. 
 This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me. 
 You're... quitting? 
 Agent Mulder. You're up. 
 I'd say this about exceeds your minimum daily requirement. 
 
 Gotta train for this kind of heavy lifting. 
 Poopy day? 
 Yup. 
 A woman? (Mulder shakes his head no) Work. 
 What do you do? 
 What do I do. (off her curious look) I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time. 
 I think that about does it, Spooky. 
 Does what? 
 Why don't you go home to the old lady -- 
 Sorry. Don't have one. 
 MULDER'S POV 
 
. 
 (startled) What? 
 Bet the Bureau's accusing you of the same thing in Dallas. 
 How's that? 
 Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding. 
 Do I know you? 
 No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that. 
 You follow me out here for a reason? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil. 
 I know the name. Why? 
 Old friend of your father's. 
 Back at the Department of State. We were what you might call fellow travelers, but his disenchantment outlasted mine. (beat) I never believed in the Project. 
 Oh, come on. Don't pretend you don't know about the Project. Your father died for it. Your sister was taken because of it. 
 How'd you find me? 
 Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight. 
 You a reporter? 
 I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN. 
 Who sent you? 
 I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas. 
 Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab... 
 They're going to pin Dallas on you, Agent Mulder. But there was nothing you could've done. Nothing anyone could've done to prevent that bomb from going off. Because the truth is something you'd never have guessed; never have predicted. 
 And what's that? 
 S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb. 
 (rhetorical disbelief) He just let it explode. 
 What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building? 
 The Federal Building was too well guarded. 
 No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing... 
 ...the thing you didn't know. That you'd never think to check. 
 Those people were already dead. 
 Before the bomb went off? 
 That's what I'm saying. 
 Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau -- 
 Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict. 
 You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...? 
 And one little boy. 
 I think you're full of shit. 
 Do you? 
 (strangely intense) I wake you? 
 Why not? It's three AM. 
 I was until about an hour ago. 
 What are you implying, Scully? 
 Is that what you'd like me to do? 
 Get dressed, Scully. 
 Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG (nervous excitement) Yes. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates? 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG And if it's unsuccessful? 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG Of what? 
 We're going to the morgue. 
 On whose orders? 
 General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately. 
 Well, call General McAddie. 
 They can patch you in through the switchboard. 
 Hey! We don't have time to dick around here watching you demonstrate your ignorance in the chain of command. The order came direct from General McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct our business while you confirm authorization. 
 Thank you. 
 Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on orders of a general? 
 According to this tag. 
 Does this fit the description you just read me, Scully? 
 It's like jelly. 
 You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris. 
 I'd been told as much. 
 I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced. 
 We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you? 
 (to the Cabbie) I think this is it up here. 
 Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence? 
 (suspiciously) You got some kind of business with him? 
 I'm looking for him. 
 Looking for him for what? 
 (to his partners) Feds are looking for him, too. (turns to Mulder) Real nice business he's got, huh? 
 What's that? 
 Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer. 
. 
 You looking for him for some other reason? 
 Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination. 
 You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil? 
 No. Don't bother. 
 MULDER'S POV 
 
 See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you. 
 Not according to the men in blue. 
 What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states. 
 They want to discredit you -- for what? 
 For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth. 
 You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why. 
 You know my work? 
 (pointedly) Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government -- 
 I don't either, but it sure sells books. 
 I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder? 
 How? 
 I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper. 
 You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why? 
 According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder? 
 It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago. 
 And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that. (beat) What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas? 
 Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak? 
 I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus. 
 What was it? 
 When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins. 
 What killed those men? 
 What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect. 
 I'll know soon enough. 
 (worked up) What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved. 
 A plague? 
 The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon. 
 Negotiating with whom? 
 I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government. 
 And they tell me I'm paranoid. 
 Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late. 
 How can I reach you? 
 You can't. 
 No calling Hawaii. 
 
 Why are you whispering? 
 What did you find? 
 What kind of infection? 
 Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too. 
 I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by. 
 -- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away. 
 
 Scully...? Hello...? 
 You're looking for what amounts to a needle in a haystack. I'm afraid the explosion was so devastating there hasn't been a whole lot we've been able to put together just yet. 
 I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found. 
 We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington. 
 Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.? 
 Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town. 
 Have you examined them? 
 No. Just fossils, far as I know. 
 I'd like this person to take a look, if you don't mind. 
 Let me just see if I can lay my hands on what you're looking for. 
 You said you weren't coming? 
 What did you find? 
 How was it contracted? 
 Like I said, these are fossils, and they weren't near the blast center, so they aren't going to tell you much. 
 You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found. 
 Show you right on a map. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG I need to have those settings checked and re-set. I need a steady minus two Celsius through the transfer of the body, after I administer the vaccine. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG It's gone! 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG It's left the body. I think it's gestated -- 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG Wait -- I see it -- 
 BRONSCHWEIG'S POV 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG (nervous wonder) Oh my god. Oh my god. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG Yes. It's...amazing. You want to get down here -- (sotto to himself) Jesus Lord...so much for little green men. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG Hey -- I need help. 
 DR. BRONSCHWEIG Hey! 
 VALET'S VOICE Sir -- you have a call. 
 
 (FILTER) We have a situation. The members are assembling. 
 (NEXT LOC.) 
 They're in the library. 
 We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive. 
 While we've been made to wait, we've watched surveillance tapes which have raised more concerns. 
 We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves. 
 (speaking up) The virus has mutated. 
 A new extraterrestrial biological entity. 
 The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization. 
 We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism. 
 Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old. (beat) What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early. 
 Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves. 
 We'll continue to use them as they do us. If only to play for more time, to continue work on our vaccine. 
 Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway. 
 We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us? 
 And Mulder? 
 Our new situation makes us vulnerable. If he learns information as we do, he could jeopardize the Project's secrecy. 
 This may take another approach. 
 You need not kill a man to destroy him. 
 
 This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed. 
 You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue? 
 And you've never seen anything like that? 
 This looks like new grass to you? 
 Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say. 
 No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks. 
 Hey! 
 You see anybody digging here? 
 Nobody. Same nobody who put this park in? That new equipment... (off the boys guilty looks) They buy you these bikes? 
 How do you know? 
 Maybe you've been watching too much 
. 
 Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks? 
 And where are they going with it? 
 What are my choices? 
 Where would they be going? 
 You think they went left? 
 Five years together -- how many times have I been wrong. 
 Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I? 
 What? 
 We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence -- 
 That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself. 
 Yeah, well they may this one. 
 This virus -- it... (afraid to say) 
 It may be extraterrestrial. 
 Been where? 
 I have no idea. 
 Very weird. 
 Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there. 
 For the purpose of what? 
 You hear that? 
 Maybe. Maybe not. 
 
. 
 Scully....? 
 Run. 
 (yelling back) Come on! 
 
 
 Scully?! 
 
. 
 Scully?! 
 
 I don't know. 
 She's coming in. 
 Special Agent Scully -- 
 Evidence of what? 
 You've been back to Dallas? 
 Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove -- 
 (challenging) -- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully -- 
 And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime -- 
 Working with? 
 You found something? 
 Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks. 
 What? 
 I'm not sure. A virus -- 
 -- You saw this experiment? 
 What did it look like? 
 There were bees. And corn crops. 
 What are they? 
 What do you think? 
 A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus. 
 That would be my guess. 
 Your guess? 
 What do you mean, your guess? 
 You told me you had answers. 
 Yeah, well I don't have them all. 
 You've been using me -- 
 I've been using you?! 
 You didn't know my father -- 
 I told you -- he and I were old friends -- 
 You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you? 
 Kurtzweil! 
 You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you. 
 Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters. 
 And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder. 
 MULDER'S POV 
. 
 What? What's wrong? 
 You can't quit, Scully. 
 We're close to something here -- we're on the verge -- 
 After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away -- 
 Just like that -- 
 I need you on this, Scully -- 
 You're wrong -- 
 You saved me, Scully. (off her look) As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing. (beat) I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win. 
 What? What happened? 
 It must... 
 Scully... 
 I think you're in anaphylactic shock -- 
 Scully -- 
 This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I have an emergency -- I have an agent down -- 
. 
 She said she had a taste in the back of her throat -- there was no pre-existing allergy to bee-stings -- the bee that stung her may have been carrying a virus -- 
 
 
 
 I think he's coming out -- 
 Hey, Mulder... 
 Mulder...? 
 Oh god... 
 (to Byers, then Langly) Tin Man. Scarecrow. (to Frohike) Toto. 
 What am I doing here? 
 You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate. 
 (woozy) Penetration but not perforation. 
 They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in. 
 When was that? 
 Two days ago. Your guy Skinner's been here with you around the clock. 
 And one in your hall. 
 Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting -- 
 You called 911. Except the call was intercepted. 
 (sitting up) They took her -- 
 Agent Mulder -- 
 Where's Scully?! 
 She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in. 
 Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing -- 
 I know. (off Mulder's reaction to this) Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas. 
 (reeling) How deep does this go? 
 I don't know. 
 Are we being watched? 
 I'm not taking any chances. 
 I need your clothes, Byers. 
 Me? 
 What are you doing? 
 I've got to find Scully. 
 Do you know where she is? 
 No. But I know someone who might have an answer. Who better. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 What are you doing here? What do you want from me? 
 
 
 What happened to Kurtzweil? 
 Where's Scully? 
 Is she alive? 
 About the conspiracy? 
 I want to know where Scully is. 
 What is it? 
 (beat) You're lying. 
 (dubious, to say the least) A virus? 
 This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease? 
 What do you mean, walked? 
 That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy -- 
 But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha. 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 What happened to Kurtzweil? 
 Where is he? 
 Let me out. Stop the car. 
 How? 
 What alien environment? 
 What about you?

. 
 Scully -- 
 Breathe -- can you breathe?! 
 What? 
 Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here. 
 
 
 We've got to keep moving. 
 You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa. 
 Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully. 
 Shit -- 
 Scully -- 
 You're not dying on me now -- godammit godammit godammit -- 
 
 
 
 
 Keep breathing, Scully. 
 
 
 
 
 Scully -- you breathing? 
 
 (over the din) We've got to run! 
 
 ... my official report is incomplete pending these new facts I'm being asked to reconcile. Agent Scully... 
 
 ...while there is direct evidence now that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing... the other events you've laid down here seem too incredible on their own, and quite frankly implausible in their connection. 
 Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism. 
 Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation. 
 (O.S.) Mr. Skinner....? 
 Please ask Agent Scully to come back to this hearing. We're not quite finished. 
 And yours? 
 You're wrong. 
 
 ADVISE. STOP.

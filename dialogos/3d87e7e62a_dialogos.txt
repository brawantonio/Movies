. 
 (O.S.) Jesus.  Just look at all that. 
 Nothing wrong with smelling the roses. 
 (O.S.) Detective? 
 (O.S.) Eleanor? 
 Hey, Mr. Angstrom! 
 MR. ANGSTROM What're you doing here? 
 Police business. 
 MR. ANGSTROM Police business? 
 I don't babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom. Just made detective three weeks ago. 
 MR. ANGSTROM Boy, Charlie must be short-handed down at the station. 
 This ought to be interesting. 
 (over the engine) Detective Dormer! 
 Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute! 
 I just want to say how incredible it is to have you working with us, Detective Dormer.  I've followed all your cases. Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey Prud'homme, the Port Angeles shootings... 
 Tell your dad the game's gonna start late this week, Ellie. 
 Sure thing, Spence. 
 Actually... 
 I just made detective three weeks ago. 
 (O.S.) Will Dormer! 
 I'll be damned! 
 Hey, Charlie. 
 Christ.  I haven't seen you boys since... 
 What's that, then? 
 Eight years. 
 Seven years?  Where does it all go?  That was some amazing time, though, wasn't it? 
 I knew that was coming.  I deserve it. 
 Yes, sir. 
 That's all, for now. 
 Oh.  Right.  Okay. 
 (sits with a SIGH) Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it. 
 "2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch." 
 I told you seven years ago this was a stepping stone to retirement. 
 What's the D.A. got them on? 
 How about you?  How you faring? 
 They're all over us, Charlie. 
 I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night. 
 Got a bunch of messages here from some guy named Warfield. 
 Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here. 
 Couldn't get a thing from the body.  Not a trace.  Town's never dealt with anything like this before. 
 This is Detective Dormer and his partner Detective Eckhart.  On loan from Buck Lundgard, Seattle Robbery and Homicide Special Branch.  They'll be helping with the Connell case. 
 (ignoring him) Anything they need to see, you show them; anywhere they want to go, you take them. (nods to Fred) This is Detective Fred Duggar.  He's been leading the investigation up to now. 
 (O.S.) Don't worry about him... 
 (O.S.) Did a fundascopic examination and found papilledema and petechiae of the retina. 
 Beaten to death. 
 Beaten to death. 
 Superficial. 
 None. 
 Even the best make mistakes. 
 (O.S.) Lower forty-eight. 
 Lower forty-eight? 
 You're not from here.  I can tell by your walk. 
 Oh?  And how's that? 
 Unsure. 
 (to Hap) Your friend's all business. 
 (nods) Alaskan summers.  Hope you're an easy sleeper.  It'll be like this all night. 
 (O.S.) Me. 
 See you have the same decor as my room. 
 You know what about. 
 When's that, a week?  Two weeks?... (heads over to him) We have to figure out a plan of action now. 
 To do nothing. 
 Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  Five hours.  Asking all kinds of questions... 
 But he's zeroing in on me.  On us. Everyone's talking about it. 
 Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard. 
 (lowers voice) Look.  We've tampered with evidence. We've pushed witnesses.  We've planted shit.  And they're sniffing around like dogs.  Especially on the Dobbs case... 
 You know I remember that. 
 Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck... 
 Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing... 
 Goddammit, Will.  You grab on to something and you don't let it go. 
 I don't know if it's because you think it's the right thing to do or because your pride won't let you do anything else.  I can't tell any more. (steps back) But I can tell you one thing.  I'm getting too old for this cowboy cop stuff.  Breaking the rules.  Cleaning up messes.  We're a dying breed, Will. You're a dying breed.  I.A., the D.A., all those reporters - they don't care what you did at Leland Street seven years ago.  They don't care that you've made this your life.  They don't care about getting the bad guy... 
 Fred wants us to meet him at the Connell's. 
 Brought you a bear claw.  Just in case you were hungry. 
 Oh.  You know.  Small-time stuff. Nothing like what you must get.  Mostly drinking-related problems.  Domestic abuse.  Barroom fights.  Stuff like that. 
 But they're so boring.  All small stuff. 
 Let me just... 
 MRS. CONNELL (O.S.) I haven't tidied up, since Fred told me not to touch anything. 
 MRS. CONNELL I don't believe in keeping a child's room like a shrine. 
 Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in. 
 He fixes boat engines. 
 What are we thinking? 
 I haven't had a chance!  You fuckers been all over my back since Monday! 
 You know smoking stunts your growth. 
 Yeah, okay, fat-ass. 
 (smiles at Will) More Alaskan hospitality. 
 Huh? 
 Sure.  She was nice. 
 Huh? 
 She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night. 
 I don't know what you're fucking talking about. 
 Stuff. 
 Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember. 
 I told you I don't remember. 
 How should I know?... 
 Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions... 
 I don't know. 
 She didn't tell me. 
 He's a little surly, isn't he? 
 We already did. 
 But there wasn't any... 
 You want me to write that down? 
 The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night. 
 At least there's variety. 
 Will? 
 I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids... 
 I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want. 
 You don't have to be involved, Will. 
 (O.S.) Ready to order? 
 Hey - you do everything around here? 
 Just about. 
 Over here. 
 What about prints? 
 I read that kind of crap. 
 Uh, right.  About two miles outside of town. 
 On the beach. 
 Yeah.  All over. 
 (O.S.) Nice.  Lighter than I remembered. 
 Glock 40.  All plastic save the barrel and firing pin.  Never rusts.  What do you carry down in Seattle? 
 Smith and Wesson 45. 
 Excellent! 
 (O.S.) Brought some coffee... 
 Anything yet? 
 Maybe this guy doesn't read the papers. 
 Or goes straight to the Sports Section. 
 But... 
 
 Sorry about... 
 Over there. 
 (O.S.) Dammit, Ellie!... 
 (O.S.) Hap! 
 And then you lost him. 
 About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot? 
 I think you need a glass of this. 
 There's a bunch of those tunnels out there, Will.  From bunkers over sixty years old.  I don't even know half of them myself, and I grew up here. 
 Will, you can't blame yourself. 
 It's only gonna make you crazy. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Right, Ellie. 
 But what about the Connell case?  I'm on the Connell case. 
 We need paperwork, Ellie.  You know that. Just write up a quick report. 
 You're no good right now, Will.  Go back to the Lodge.  Try to get some rest. 
 ...earlier this evening after an aborted attempt to apprehend a suspect.  He was forty-five... 
 I'm sorry about your partner. 
 (answering) Pioneer Lodge?... (listens) Hold on a second.  He's right here. 
 WARFIELD'S VOICE Detective Dormer.  I've been trying to reach you.  I was very sorry to hear about your partner, Detective Eckhart. It must have been a terrible shock, what happened this morning. 
 WARFIELD'S VOICE Oh, nothing.  Just that I felt Detective Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting to make a real connection before you left.  I sensed that he was ready to get some things off his chest.  Did you sense anything like that, Detective?  I mean, as his partner?... 
 HAP'S REFLECTION 
 They're watching us, Will... 
 (O.S.) ...We're going to bring down a couple of guys from Ridgemount, but I want us to step up the investigation here... 
 ...Nightmute hasn't lost an officer in thirty-seven years, and even though Detective Eckhart wasn't from here, he was as good as one of us on this case.  I had the honor of working with him down in Seattle for a number of years.  He was a fine detective and an even better man. 
 Okay.  Then let's get to it. 
 (O.S.) Detective Dormer? 
 I'm so sorry about what happened.  I know you did everything you could... 
 He has to be a prick, Fred.  He's a great detective. 
 Detective Dormer! 
 Oh, a real tear-jerker.  Brody, the good guy, just got shot. 
 I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something. 
 We just gotta catch the bastard, right? 
 What I saw? 
 Pretty much nothing.  That fog was so thick.  The bullet seemed to come out of nowhere.  I don't even remember seeing any shapes.  Then I saw you.  But only when you came up close.  Then you disappeared again. (shrugs) I guess I heard more than I saw. 
 Time for your meds. 
 Lonnie and I went to high school together. 
 Just take the pills, Farrell. 
 Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through. 
 We'll get the other one, though. 
 (O.S.) ...and it was at this point that Detective Dormer headed towards the noise... 
 What? 
 You're supposed to be Farrell.  Shot in the thigh and writhing in pain. 
 C'mon, Ellie.  What's it matter? 
 Accuracy.  That's what. (points to the ground) Now get down. 
 Ow. 
 (into tape recorder) ...shortly after hearing the second shot, Detective Dormer continued through the water until he spotted the body, lying approximately fifteen feet away. 
 (O.S.) Yeah.  And I'm freezing my nads off! 
 Ellie!  Think I found something! 
. 
 (O.S.) Detective? 
 #1 Where do you want us? 
 #1 We did the interviews with all the nearby houses like you asked. 
 #1 (shakes his head) Here's a list of who we talked to. 
 Here.  It's on the house. 
 I got it. (smiles) Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years. 
 No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him. 
 That's not what he thinks. 
 Short.  Dark hair.  Not that memorable. 
 Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time. 
 The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year. 
 That's my sister. 
 (nods) Twelve years younger. 
 Oh, I shouldn't have... 
 That must have been awful for you. 
 You okay? 
 (unsure) Okay. 
 Detective.  Thought you were sending one of your lackeys. 
 It's different when you know them, isn't it? (nods to clipboard) Just sign over there and she's all yours. 
 (O.S.) Your partner didn't suffer much... 
 You're looking a little green, Detective. 
 Detective Dormer?  Telephone. 
 This came for you earlier. 
 MAN'S VOICE I bet you haven't been getting much sleep. 
 MAN'S VOICE You lower-48s.  You think the white nights are kind of neat.  Then you can't sleep for days.  I've seen it happen about a million times.  But you can't sleep for a different reason. 
 MAN'S VOICE I saw what really happened, Will... 
 MAN'S VOICE I saw you kill your partner.  With your back-up weapon.  Out there on the beach. I saw you shoot him dead... 
 MAN'S VOICE Don't worry.  I won't tell anyone.  Oh, and I saw you take my gun.  My uncle's old 357.  I dropped it in the rocks. But you can go ahead and keep that. 
 (O.S.) Detective Dormer! 
 You look like you're in a hurry.  I just wanted to ask you about these pictures. 
 But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog. 
 How much closer would you say you were? 
 Five feet?  Seven feet? 
 ...And that's how I think Kay would want us to remember her... 
 ...And always, always with a smile on her face. 
 (O.S.) Want one? 
 
 Thought I smelled something. 
 Who're you? 
 Fuckin' cop. 
 You coming or not? 
 I never met anyone from Seattle before. 
 What are you doing in this shit-hole town? 
 I was her best friend. 
 Since grade school. 
 We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other. 
 Everybody says I'm holding up great, considering.  Don't even care if I go to school.  They're all worried I haven't cried yet. 
 Do we have to talk about Kay?  I don't want to talk about her right now.  Let's just drive.  Go somewhere. 
 Long as it's fun. 
 Hey... 
 Move over! 
 You crazy son-of-a-bitch!  You could have killed us! 
 That's what I said. 
 No... 
 I don't know. 
 She wouldn't tell me! 
 It was like some big fucking secret! 
 She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That he was going to take her! 
 My arm! 
 She used some stupid code name. 
 Brody...I don't know... (crying) ...Something Brody! 
 
 WALTER'S VOICE Now you're mad at me. 
 A 
 
 
 A PICK-UP 
 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Are you alright?  You popped out from nowhere! 
 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) He okay? 
 I don't think you should move. 
 You sure you're okay? 
 Careful not to bleed on my interior. 
 When I was seven my mother and grandmother took me to Vancouver.  We were walking along the street one day when these two men ran past and snatched my grandmother's purse right from under her arm.  Right from under her arm.  That night a police officer came to our hotel room to ask us questions.  Stood the whole time. 
 You know this glacier moves a quarter of an inch every day? 
 I stood right behind you...I saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him... 
 Then why lie about it? 
 No game. 
 I figured we're partners on this one.  I mean, after what I saw... 
 I research my novels.  I know the procedures.  You'd have cuffed me back at the ferry.  You'd have called for back- up, read me my rights, and gotten a search warrant for my apartment.  You're a well-respected detective.  There's no reason for you to be talking to me right now... 
 I'm sorry? 
 (perks up) Oh? 
 Thought you might find that. 
 Down at the station? 
 Okay.  Okay.  Brought in for questioning. Good.  I can write this. 
 Next ferry's in forty-five minutes. 
 You'll know.  At the questioning. 
 (to Will) Full up. 
 Which way are you walking? 
 I needed to get your signature on something. 
 About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate. 
 Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him. (smiles) You said that once, remember? 
 Oh!  I forgot to tell you.  The Puffins won. 
 ...I saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him... 
 You'd have done the same thing, Will.  I know you would... 
 A 357 
 
 You sure about that, buddy? 
 (O.S.) Detective Dormer? 
 (startled by his appearance) Will...I... 
 There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise. (beat) Says he can't sleep. 
 Are you alright? 
 Did something happen? 
 Will... 
 Will. 
 One of your cases? 
 What happened? 
 Will. 
 What if someone finds out? 
 Well, that's not going to happen now. 
 There are two kinds of people in Alaska. Those who were born here and those who've come here to escape something in their lives. (beat) I wasn't born here, Will.  I'm in no position to judge anyone.  I'm not about that any more. 
 (O.S.) Yes I was. 
 
 She was, not quite a "fan."  More an avid reader of my detective novels. 
 When did you first meet her? 
 A year ago.  At one of my signings. 
 That's right. 
 She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books. 
 Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week... 
 What do you mean, Detective Dormer? 
 She was only seventeen. 
 I suppose. 
 No. 
 I was a mentor to her. 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have. 
 She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to. 
 That boyfriend.  Randy. 
 That's right. 
 He.  Well, he... 
 Well.  He hit her. 
 She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret. 
 Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell? 
 He has a terrible rage.  Kay even said he carried a handgun around with him. 
 Could I have some more coffee, Detective Burr? 
 
 A. 
 (O.S.) You can't fucking do this! 
 (O.S.) Hey!  I'm working on that! 
 (O.S.) Found something. 
 (O.S.) What the fuck is that! 
 (O.S.) That's not mine, man!  That's not mine! 
 (O.S.) No way, man! 
 I swear to God.  I didn't kill her.  I swear to God... 
 (O.S.) I can't believe it.  Randy Stetz. 
 He was an asshole. 
 That doesn't mean anything. 
 Our dads were on the same boat. (to Will) We used to wait for them together. 
 He used to pick fights at the gas station. 
 How do you like our beer? 
 They don't have titanium shades over at the Pioneer. 
 You lose all sense of time. 
 Better than Fred's home town. 
 (O.S.) Hi, guys. 
 You hear what happened, Ellie? 
 Yeah. 
 Rich found the gun. 
 I know.  I heard. 
 I found this out on the beach. 
 What is it? 
 Shell casing.  9mm. 
 Let it go, Ell.  We got the bad guy. 
 None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon. And the murder weapon was a 357. 
 It's a legitimate point, isn't it, Detective Dormer? 
 Worth pursuing? 
 Me, Pop! 
 ELLIE'S DAD Ellie?  You okay? 
 Where's all my academy stuff? 
 (smiles) Hi, Will... 
 I figured we should touch base.  Compare notes.  I think it went well.  What did you think? 
 Told you I could write an ending. 
 I thought maybe we could talk some more. 
 But we work so well together... 
 You run on two settings, Will.  I've noticed that... 
 Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me. 
. 
 Then so was mine... 
 I didn't want to kill her, Will. 
 It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all. 
 Yes.  Like that. 
 If you want it to be... 
 I have a summer house up by Kgun Lake. I'm going to write my next novel there. It's about a famous detective who goes bad. 
 (O.S.) I was hoping not to send you back with so much paperwork, Will. 
 Can't talk you into staying for a couple of days?  Do some fishing?  Show you what normally goes on around here. 
 Too bad... 
 Didn't want to miss anything. 
 Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours. 
 Good. 
 Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's. 
 Sure. 
 ELLIE'S HAND 
 I found a new friend. 
 Very funny, Farrell... 
 Hi, Rachel. 
 I would have seen if he came back. 
 Detective Dormer? 
 What is all this? 
 (O.S.) Here to visit me? 
 Where's your back-up? 
 You're not following procedure. 
 We're on the same side, Will.  You know that.  After what we've been through together.  We're partners.  Bound by a secret. 
 Will... 
 You give the police a bad name, Will. 
 A 
 Shit! 
 Wild card. 
 That jammed the last time, remember? 
 (O.S.) Detective Dormer! 
 You're shot. 
 I'm going to make a tourniquet. 
 I know. 
 You shot Detective Eckhart, didn't you? 
 Did you mean to? 
 Why? 
 This one looks worse. 
 No!

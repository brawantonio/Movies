 
 MR. BOBINSKY Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri ... 
 2 (O.C.) We're here. Time to muscle up. 
 MOVER 2 (CONT'D) 
 (EFFORTS) Got it? Almost there, just a few more. Come on, now, LIFT. 
 Hello?...   Who's there? 
 You scared me to death, you mangy thing! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) I'm just looking for an old well. Know it? 
 CORALINE(CONT'D) Not talking, huh? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me... the well! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) (freaked out) 
! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) 
 
 
 Ow! 
 And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by 
 He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral ­ you know, wild? Of course, I do feed him every night and sometimes he'll come in my window `n bring me little dead things. 
 
 Huh? 
 MICHIGAN? And if I'm a "water witch", 
 You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it! 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a sky full of stars in the middle of the day. 
 
 (SOFTENS) Huh. 
 Surprised she let you move in... 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) ... my Gramma. She owns the "Pink Palace" (indicates house in distance) Won't rent to people with kids. 
 What do you mean? 
 (suddenly worried) Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it. 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat. 
 
 Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of course. What'd you get saddled with? 
 I wasn't saddled with anything. It's Coraline. 
 Caroline what? 
 Coraline. Coraline Jones. 
 (confused, not hearing it) Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I heard an ordinary name, like Caroline -- 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) -- can lead people to have ordinary expectations about a person-- 
 WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) (calling from afar) Wyborne! 
 I think I heard someone calling you, Wyborne. 
 What? I didn't hear anything-- 
 Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were- you-born. 
 WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) Wyborne! 
 (under his breath, nervous) Grandma! 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch. 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) But I'd wear gloves next time. 
 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) `Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh, it's poison oak. 
 Ehh!! 
 I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom. 
 (not listening) Uh huh. 
 I would have died. 
 (continues typing) That's nice. 
 Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's perfect weather for gardening. 
 No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a mess. 
 But Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit. Isn't that why we moved here? 
 Something like that. But then we had the accident. 
 Wasn't my fault you hit that truck. 
 I never said it was. 
 
 (MUTTERS) I can't believe it -- you and Dad get paid to write about plants and you hate dirt. 
 Coraline, I don't have time for you right now. And you still have unpacking to do. Lots of unpacking. 
 That sounds exciting. 
 (V.O.) Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's trunk. Look familiar? Wybie. 
 (to herself) Huh... a little me? That's weird. 
 What's his name, anyway? 
 Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls. 
 Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad? 
. 
 Hello, Coraline... (notices doll's reflection) And... Coraline doll?... 
 D'you know where the garden tools are? 
 It's pouring out there, isn't it. 
 Humph, it's just raining. 
 What'd the boss say? 
 
 Then you won't need the tools. 
 CHARLIE (CONT'D) Uhhh, you know, this house is a hundred and fifty years old. 
 So? 
 So explore it! 
 CHARLIE (CONT'D) Go out and ... count all the doors and windows and write that down. List everything blue! 
 Ewww! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Ahh!! 
 No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--! 
 (O.S.) 
 --AAAAAAA! 
 One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting ... four incredibly boring windows ... and no... more... doors... 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) All right, little me, where are you hiding? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Huh? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Hey Mom... 
 (O.S.) Where does this door go? 
 I'm really, really busy! 
 I think it's locked. 
 (O.S.) 
 (O.S.) Pleeeeeeeeease! 
 Uhhh... 
 Will you stop pestering me if I do this for you? 
 MEL (CONT'D) Fine. 
 Bricks? I don't get it. 
 They must have closed this off when they divided up the house. 
 You're kidding? And why is the door so small? 
 We made a deal. ZIP IT! 
 You didn't lock it. 
 (O.S.) AaaaaH!!! 
 (O.S.) Oh, my twitchy witchy girl, 
 I think you are so nice, I give you bowls of porridge And I give you bowls of ice -- 
 (really bad note) -- cream! 
 Why don't you ever cook, Mom? 
 Coraline, we've been through this before: your Dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out of the way. 
 MEL (CONT'D) I swear I'll go food shopping soon as we finish the catalog. (indicates Coraline's plate) Try some of the chard, you need a vegetable. 
 Looks more like slime to me. 
 Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot -- now what's it going to be? 
 Think they're trying to poison me? 
 Don't forget about me, guys. Okay? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Good-night...little me. 
 Whoa... 
 Huh? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) MMMMM, something smells good. 
 Mom?! What are you doing here in the middle of the night? 
 You're just in time for supper, dear! 
 You're not my mother. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) My mother doesn't have b-b-buh... 
 B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them? 
 Hello? 
 Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new song? 
 My father can't play piano. 
 No need to ... this piano plays ME! 
 I, uh ­ sorry ­ but she said to tell you the food's ready. 
 Mmmmm! Who's starving? Raise your hand. 
 We give our thanks and ask to bless, Our Mother's golden chicken breast! 
 Mmmm, this chicken is good. 
 Hungry, aren't you. 
 (nodding, mouth full) D'you have any gravy? 
 Well, here comes the gravy train! Choo- choo! 
 Another roll, sweet peas? Corn on the cob? 
 (mouth full) I'm real thirsty. 
 Of course! Any requests? 
 Mango milk shake? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Home? 
 We've been waiting for you, Coraline. 
 For me? 
 Yep. Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo. 
 I didn't know I had an Other Mother. 
 Of course you do. Everyone does. 
 Really? 
 Uh huh, and soon as you're through eating, I thought we'd play a game. 
 
 Perfect! Hide and seek in the rain. 
 What rain? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Huh, what about the mud? 
 We love mud here! 
 Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies -- it's great for poison oak. 
 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) I, I'd love to play, but ... I better get home to my other mother. 
 But I'm your other mother. 
 
 (YAWNS) I think I should get to bed. 
 Of course, sweetheart, it's all made up. 
 (shakes head) But ... 
 Come along, sleepyhead. 
 Wow. 
 Hello Coraline, hello, hello! 
 What's shakin', baby? 
 Hello. 
 (MICHIGAN-SPEAK) Hey, how zit goin', yuper! 
 (MICHIGAN-SPEAK) Where's your swampers and tuke? 
 Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls? I can't wait till summer. You're both comin', right? 
 Oh, the mud... 
 
 
 It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you weren't really you; you were my other mother. 
 
 You were in the dream too, Dad. You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers. 
 (pretend offense) Orange? My monkey slippers are blue. 
: 
 CHARLIE (CONT'D) 
 CHARLIE (CONT'D) Because I have a terrible case of writer's rash. On my---. 
 If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP. 
 MEL (CONT'D) Coraline, why don't you go visit downstairs? I bet those "actresses" would love to hear your dream. 
 Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats. 
 
 (NODS) Uh huh. 
 Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky... 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Ohh, Poo-eeeee! 
 H-hello?... 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) I think our mail got mixed up.    Should I leave it outside or... 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Hmmm... 
: 
 MR. BOBINSKY 
 SEE-KRET... 
 
 MR. BOBINSKY 
 (SNIFFS) Mmmm... Noviseer. 
 Huh? 
 MR. BOBINSKY New "cheese" samples. 
 Meeshkas? 
 MR. BOBINSKY The Mice! 
 Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones. 
 MR. BOBINSKY 
 (BOWS) And I am the Amazing Bobinsky! But you can call me Mr. B, because amazing I already know that I am. 
 MR. BOBINSKY Ha! You see, Caroline, the problem is my new songs go oompah oompah. But the jumping mice play only toodle toot, like that. Is nice, but not so much amazing? So now-- (indicates smelly mail) --I switch to stronger cheese, and soon ­ 
! 
 Cor-a-line. 
 (to herself) Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot. 
 MR. BOBINSKY (O.C.) 
 No!!! 
 MR. BOBINSKY The mice...asked me to give you message. 
 The...jumping mice? 
 MR. BOBINSKY They are saying: do not go through leetle door. Do you know such a thing? 
 The one behind the wall paper? But... it's all bricked up. 
 MR. BOBINSKY Bah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes the mice are leetle... 
 
 (HARSH) Oh cease your infernal yapping! (to Coraline, sweetly) How nice to see you, Caroline. Would you like to come in? We're playing cards. 
 Still Coraline, Miss Spink. 
 (over shoulder) Miriam, put the kettle on! 
 April, I think you're being followed. 
 It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline? She'll be having the Oolong tea. 
 No, no, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer Jasmine. 
 No, Oolong. 
 Ah, Jasmine it is, then. 
 Come on, boys! 
. 
 
 
 (SIGHS) Our sweet, departed angels. Couldn't bear to part with them ... so we had them stuffed. 
 Oh go on, have one ­ it's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton ­ best in the world. 
 (O.C.) ...seventh, the third, the ninth, yes, the fourthI'm right; and Jock Junior, Jock senior, Jock the third, the fourth... 
 Read what? 
 Oh, your tea leaves, dear. They'll tell me your future. Drink up then, go on. 
 Oh, give me that cup, April, your eyes are going. 
 My eyes! You're blind as a bat! 
 Oh, now, ummm... not to worry, child, it's good news: there's a tall, handsome beast in your future. 
 A what? 
 Miriam, oh really, you're holding it wrong. 
 What do you see? 
 
 I see a giraffe. 
 Giraffes don't just fall from the sky, Miriam. 
 Oh, lord! 
 Well, what should I do? 
 Never wear green in your dressing room. 
 Acquire a very tall step ladder. 
 And be very, very careful. Now, was there something you came to tell us? 
 No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea, though. 
 Toodle-oo. 
 Cheery-bye. 
 (to herself) Danger? 
 Owwwwwwww! 
 Great, the village stalker. 
 Ow. I - I wasn't stalking you. We're hunting banana slugs. 
 What d'ya mean, "we?" 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss- puss! 
 What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez. 
 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) So... that doll. Did you make it look like me? 
 Oh no; I found it that way. It's older than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly. 
 (points to self) C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and raincoat? 
 Dang, check out Slugzilla! 
 
 Huh? 
 I meant my parents; they don't listen to me either. 
 Uh huh... You mind? 
 Ew! 
 You know, I've never been inside the Pink Palace. 
 
 Grandma would kill me. Thinks it's dangerous or something. 
 Dangerous? 
 Well... she had a twin sister. 
 So? 
 (O.C.). When they were kids, Grandma's sister disappeared. 
 (ON CAMERA) She says she was stolen. 
 (O.S.) 
 CORALINE(CONT'D) Well, what do you think? 
 Uhhh, I-I don't know. 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) Maybe she just ran away? 
 WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) Wyborne! 
 Look, I gotta go. 
 Wait a minute! 
 Welcome back, darling. 
 Hi. 
 So thoughtful of you to send this nice cheddar, Coraline. 
 Cheddar?... Oh, the mice bait... 
 Would you go fetch your father? 
 You mean my Other Father? 
 Your better father, dear.   He's out in the garden. 
. But my parents don't have time to garden. 
 Mmmmmm! 
 Go on... 
. 
 Hey!!! 
 I love your garden! 
 Our garden, Coraline! 
. 
 
 Oops, daughter in distress! 
 Well, she says it's time for dinner ... breakfast ... food? 
 Hop on, kiddo, I want to show you something! 
 I can't believe you did this! 
 Mother said you'd like it! Boy she knows you like the back of her hand. 
 Mmmm...so good! 
 I love dinner, breakfast food. 
 Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to come see the Jumping Mice perform after dinner. 
 Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was wrong. 
 Well, everything's right in this world, Kiddo. 
 Your father and I will clean up while you and your friend head upstairs. 
 My friend? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were- you-born. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Hello? 
 I thought you'd like him more, if he spoke a little less. (shrugs, smiling) So I fixed him. 
 So he can't talk at all? 
 Nope. 
 Hmm, I like it. 
 
 You're awful cheerful, considering you can't say anything. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she... 
 Whoa... cool! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Look at you! 
 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) It's wonderful, Wybie! 
. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Wow! 
. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Yah! Whooo-oooh! That was great! 
 We loved it, Mr. B. It was ... so ... so-- 
--- 
 A-mazing! 
 Ughhh. 
 (V.O.). ... there were garden squash like balloon animals AND snap dragons. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Oh, and upstairs I saw a real mouse circus, not pretend like the crazy man's in our house. 
 You sure you won't come? 
 (indicates neck brace) Don't fret, Charlie, they'll love the new catalog. At least, they'll love my chapters. 
 MEL (CONT'D) I did not call him crazy, Coraline.   He's drunk. 
 Well, I guess I'll see you around, you dizzy dreamer. 
 Da-ad! I'm not five anymore. 
 My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!! 
 Put them back. 
 But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes. No one will have these. 
 Put them back. 
 My other mother would get them. 
 Maybe she should buy all your clothes. 
 So what do you think's in the other apartment? 
 I don't know. Not a family of Jones imposters. 
 Then why'd you lock the door? 
 (shorter than previous) Oh, I found some rat crap and... I thought you'd feel ... safer. 
 They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams aren't dangerous; they're the most fun I've had since we've moved here. 
 Your school might be fun. 
 With those stupid uniforms?   Right. 
 Had to give it a try. 
 How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup- salsa wrap for lunch? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway. Dad's planning something special. 
 Gross-gusting. 
 
 (BRIGHTENS ) You wanna come along? You can pick out something you like. 
 Oh, like the gloves? 
 Look, Coraline... if things go well today, I promise I'll make it up. 
 That's what you always say. 
 Won't be long. 
 
 (MUTTERS) But I might be... 
 
 (TRIUMPHANT) I knew it was real! 
: 
 (V.O.) Dearest Coraline, 
 Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that talks too much. You must be the Other Cat. 
 No. I'm not the other anything. I'm me. 
 Um... I can see you don't have button eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can you talk? 
 I just can. 
. 
 Cats don't talk at home. 
 No? 
 Nope. 
 
 (DRYLY) Well, you're clearly the expert on these things. After all, I'm just a big fat wuss puss. 
 Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I called you that, I really am. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) How'd you get here? 
 I've been coming here for a while. 
 CAT (CONT'D) It's a game we play. She... (indicates house) ...hates cats and tries to keep me out. But she can't, of course. 
 CAT (CONT'D) I come and go as I please. 
 
 
 What do you mean? She's amazing! 
 You probably think this world is a dream come true. But you're wrong. The Other Wybie told me so. 
 That's nonsense. He can't talk. 
 Perhaps not to you. We cats, however, have far superior senses than humans and can see and smell, and -- 
 CAT (CONT'D) 
 Hey, Wybie. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) 
 (whisper, to Wybie) Oh my God. 
 (CONT'D) Will send sailors swooning --oh--! 
 
 (WHISPERS) I can't look! 
 How infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable! 
 In apprehension how like a god! 
 Ahhh!!! 
 The paragon of animals! 
 Yeah!! 
 Hey there. 
 Was it wonderful, dear? 
 Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat ­ Spink and Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies, that was just a disguise. But then, I was flying through the air and... it was, it was magic. 
 You do like it here, don't you, Coraline? 
 (nods, turns back) Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie. 
 You could stay here forever... if you want to. 
 Really? 
 Sure...we'll sing and play games, and Mother will cook your favorite meals. 
 There's one tiny little thing we need to do. 
 What's that? 
 Well, it's a surprise. 
 For you ... our little doll. 
 CORALINE'S EYES. 
 
! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) 
 Oh, but we need a yes ... if you want to stay here. 
 
 There now; it's your decision, darling. We only want what's best for you. 
 I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW! 
 
 Before dinner? 
 I'm really, really tired. Yeah... (fakes huge yawn) I just need to sleep on things. 
 Well of course you do, darling... I'll be happy to tuck you in. 
 (palms out, forced smile) Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so much already-- 
 You're welcome. And I ­ (smiles to Other Father) we aren't worried at all, darling. 
 What's wrong, Coraline? Don't you want to play? 
 Yeah, I wanna hugga your face! 
 I'm going home tonight, robots - and I won't be back. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! 
: 
 CORALINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Go to sleep, go to sleep... 
 (V.O.) There's just one tiny little thing we have to do. 
 Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep... 
 (V.O.) So sharp you won't feel a thing... 
 Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep... 
 (V.O.) Soon you'll see things our way... 
 
. 
 Mom!... Dad!.. 
. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Oh God, I'm still here? 
 Hey you! Where's the Other Mother?     I want to go home. 
 All will be swell, soon as Mother's refreshed. Her strength is our strength. 
 If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna find the Other Wybie. He'll help me. 
 No point; he pulled a long face... 
 
 And what do you think you're doing? 
 Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what I'M doing. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the old well be here? 
 Nothing out here ... it's the empty part of this world. She only made what she knew would impress you. 
 But why? Why does she want me? 
 Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat daughters! 
 I don't know. How do you taste? 
 Huh? But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it? 
 Walk around the world. 
 Small world. 
 Hang on-- 
 Stop, he's one of the circus mice! 
 I don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm. 
 Gooooood kitty. 
 (O.S.) They say even the proudest -- 
 I want to be with my real mom and dad. I want you to let me go. 
 Is that any way to talk to your mother? 
 You aren't my mother. 
 Apologize at once, Coraline! 
 No. 
 
 Ow, what are you doing! 
 Ow, that hurts! 
 
 (WHISPERS) Hush! And shush! For the Beldam might be listening! 
 
 (WHISPERS) You ... you mean the Other Mother? ... 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Who are you? 
 
 (WISTFUL) Don't remember our names... But I `member my true mommy... 
 Why are you all here? 
 The Beldam! 
 And saw that we weren't    happy. 
 Gave all that we asked - 
 She said that she loved us, 
 And ate up our lives. 
 Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life. Beating her is my only chance. 
 Has she taken those, too? 
 Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls will be freed. 
 I ... I'll try. 
 
?.. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Did she do this to you? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) I hope that feels bet-- 
 Shhh. 
 Let's go! 
 Come on. She'll hurt you again! 
 
 I'M! 
 Anybody here? Hello, hello, hello! Real Dad ... Real Mom! 
 Oh, Mom's groceries! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) 
 I missed you guys so much-- You'll never-- 
 Oh... the Wybie that talks... 
 Huh? Ha ha ha....yeah... Um, so you know tha-that old doll I gave you? 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) Um... my Gramma's real mad, says it was her sister's - the one that... disappeared? 
 
 (REALIZATION) You stole that doll, didn't you? 
. Well, i-it looked just like you. And I 
 It used to look like this pioneer girl; then Huck Finn junior; then it was this Little Rascals chick with all these ribbons, and braids, and.... 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Grandma's missing sister! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) I think I just met her. C'mon! 
 Uh, listen, I-I-I'm really not supposed 
 She's in there. 
 C-can you ­ can you unlock it? 
 Not in a million years. But it wouldn't matter; she can't escape without her eyes. None of the ghosts can. 
 Huhhhhhh... So, uh, I really need to get that doll? 
 Great! I'd love to get rid of it! 
 Where are you hiding, you little monster?! 
 You and Gramma been talking? 
 The doll's her spy! It's how she watches you, finds out what's wrong with your life! 
 The doll...is my Gramma's...spy. 
 NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this whole world where everything's better - the food, the garden, the-- (leans in on him) --neighbors. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) But it's all a trap! 
 Yeah... Uh, I think I heard someone calling me, Jonesy. 
 Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat! 
 The cat... I-I'll just tell Gramma that you couldn't find the doll-- OW! 
 You're not LISTENING TO ME! 
 That's ... cause ... you're CRAZY! 
 You creep! 
 (calling over his shoulder) Crazy!! 
 Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave me the doll! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Mom!   Dad! 
 Pick it up, Dad, pick it up. 
 (V.O.) Hi! 
 Dad!   Whe- 
 (V.O.) I'm digging in my garden right now, but leave a message and I'll get right back to you. 
 Where have you gone? 
 Uh... don't you only make wings for the ... dead ones? 
 Just looking ahead dear... Angus hasn't been feeling very well of late. 
 (O.S.) April? Aren't you getting ready? 
 (looks off camera) We've lost our ride, Miriam. Caroline says her parents have vanished, quite completely. 
 What?! We've waited months for those tickets. 
 I suppose we could walk! 
 With your gamy legs? It's nearly two miles to the theater! 
 Oh, oh yes ... your missing parents. We know just what you need. Miriam, get...that's right. 
 How is hundred-year-old candy going to 
-- 
 There you go, sweety. 
 What's it for? 
 Well,it might help. They're good for bad things, sometimes. 
 No, they're good for lost things. 
 It's bad things, Miriam. 
 Lost things, April. 
 Bad. 
 Lost. 
 Bad things! 
 Lost. 
 Bad. 
 Lost. 
 Good-night, Mom. Good-night, Dad. 
 Hello. How did you get in? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Do you know where Mom and Dad are? 
 
 MOM! DAD!! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) How did this happen? 
 She's taken them. 
 They're not coming back, are they ­ Mom and Dad. Not on their own. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Only one thing to do. 
 You know, you're walking right into her trap. 
 I have to go back. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) They are my parents. 
 Challenge her then. She may not play fair but she won't refuse. She's got a thing for games. 
 Hmmm, okay. 
 Coraline? 
 Mom? 
 Coraline, you came back for us! 
 
! 
 Darling! (voice shifting) Why would you run away from me? 
 Where are my parents? 
 They weren't bored of me.   You stole them! 
 
 (OFFHAND) Why don't you have your own key? 
 Only one key. 
 (SUNNIER) The garden squash need tending, don't you think, pumpkin? 
 Squish squash, pumpkin sauce... 
 (loud whisper) Mom, Dad, where'd she hide you? 
 (V.O.) (to herself) Be strong, Coraline. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) (anxious, trying to be cool) Why don't we play ... a game? I know you like them. 
 
 (NODS) Uh huh. 
) An exploring game ... a finding things game. 
 And what is it you'd be finding, Coraline? 
 My real parents. 
 (DISMISSIVE) Too easy. 
 And, and the eyes of the ghost children. 
 If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever and let you love me. (indicates button box) And I'll let you sew buttons into my eyes. 
 Then you let me go. You let everyone go ­ my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here. 
 Not till you give me a clue. 
 And for my parents? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) 
 (SHRUGS) Fine. Don't tell me... 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) ...it's a deal-- 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) What does she mean "wonders?" 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Hmmm. 
 No!! 
. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Stop!! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Why steal this? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Wow... 
! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) That must be it. 
. 
 Sorrry, so sorrry, Motherrr making meeee. 
. 
 Bless you, miss, you found me! But there's two eyes still lost. 
 Don't worry, I'm getting the hang of it! 
 
 Thief!! Give it back! 
 Oh, Wybie... 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) 
 I'm Coraline. 
 Uh-huh. 
 (CONT'D) You'll just go home and be bored and neglected... 
 (CONT'D) ...same as alvays. 
 (CONT'D) Stay here vis us; vee vill listen to you and laugh vis you. 
 You don't get it, do you? 
 Of course you don't understand. You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B. 
. 
 Ahhh! No!! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) 
! 
 Noooo! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) 
 I think I mentioned that I don't like rats at the best of times. 
 I think you might have said something like that. 
 It looked like you needed this one, however. 
 Thank you. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) I'm heading inside. I still have to find my parents. 
! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Come on, quickly! 
 So, you're back.... 
 BELDAM (CONT'D) And you brought vermin with you. 
 No, I ... I brought a friend. 
 
 You, you have a very funny way of showing it. 
 So?     Where are they - the ghost eyes? 
 Hold on. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) We aren't finished yet, are we? 
 No, I suppose not. After all, you still need to find your old parents, don't you? Too bad you won't have this. 
 I already know where you've hidden them. 
 Well... produce them. 
 They're behind that door. 
 Oh, they are, are they? 
 There! 
 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Go on.   Open it. They'll be there, all right. 
 You're wrong, Coraline! 
 BELDAM (CONT'D) 
 BELDAM (CONT'D) Now you're going to stay here forever. 
 No ... I'm ... 
. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D)

! 
 BELDAM (CONT'D) You horrible cheating girl! 
 BELDAM (CONT'D) Noo!! Where are you? You selfish brat!! 
 BELDAM (CONT'D) Hahahaha... 
 BELDAM (O.S.) (CONT'D) 
 
 
 PLEASE...SHUT!! 
 (O.S.) 
! 
 (O.S.) Coraline? We're home! 
 Mom! Dad! I missed you so much! 
 Missed us? 
 MEL (CONT'D) Oh no, you broke my favorite snow globe. 
 I didn't break it. It must've broke when you escaped. 
 And cut your knee. 
 Coraline, I asked you to count all the windows, not put your knee through them. 
 
 Well, get yourself cleaned up, 
 (WARMS) we're going out tonight. 
 We gotta lot to celebrate! 
 You're talking about... your garden catalog? 
 Of course! What else? 
 But look at the snow on your clothes...? 
 
 So, gonna order the tulips? 
 What's that? 
 For the garden party!! 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Dad! 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) So, Mom. Invitations? Don't forget the invitations. 
 Even Bobinsky? 
 Mr. B's not drunk, Mom, he's just...eccentric. 
 Good night, Coraline. 
 Oh, hello again. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) You still mad? 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) I'm really sorry I threw you at her - the Other Mother? ­ it was all I could think of. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) I think it's time, don't you? To set them free? 
 Well, I'm glad it's finally over! 
 (SIGHS) It is over and done with ... for us. 
 What about...me? 
 But how?   I locked the door!? 
 
 (WHISPERS) Tain't all bad, miss. Thou art alive ... thou art still ... living... 
: 
 I -- I've gotta hide this somewhere, s- somewhere she can never ... 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) Outta my way! 
 Oh.... my twitchy witchy girl, I think you are so nice ... 
 ... I give you bowls of porridge And I give you bowls of ice cream. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) I give you lots of kisses, And I give you lots of hugs ... 
 ... But I never give you sandwiches With grease and worms and mung beans. 
 
!!!! 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) 
 WYBIE (CONT'D) I-I'm really sorry I didn't believe you about all this ... evil stuff, Coraline. 
 Why did you change your mind? 
 W-well, Gramma showed me this picture, after I called you crazy? 
 WYBIE (O.C.) (CONT'D) It's her and her sister, before she disappeared. 
 The sweet ghost girl. 
 WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) Wyborne!   Come home!!

 Just bring her by the house tomorrow.      We can tell her together. 
 We...we can?? 
 You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk me. 
 Wasn't my idea.

 Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss Forcible.

 Actually, it's just lemonade. 
 CORALINE (CONT'D) How's Angus doing? 
 Oh, much better, dear... But he can't duck his wings forever!

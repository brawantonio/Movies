 
 DR. GREENBAUM Jesus. We've been at this for six months. 
 DR. GREENBAUM And you haven't made an ounce of progress. 
 DR. GREENBAUM (not looking up) There's no smoking in my office. 
 DR. GREENBAUM But you said you have the worst reputation. 
 DR. GREENBAUM Don't you want to change that? 
 DR. GREENBAUM I think that's all the time we have for today. 
 DR. GREENBAUM No. This is going to be our last session. 
 DR. GREENBAUM This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you. 
 DR. GREENBAUM You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian. 
 DR. GREENBAUM No it doesn't. I see right through you. 
 DR. GREENBAUM I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble. 
 DR. GREENBAUM My daughter, Rachel. 
 DR. GREENBAUM Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s. 
 DR. GREENBAUM Good luck, Sebastian. 
 DR. GREENBAUM Would you please leave. 
 Hi, mom. 
 DR. GREENBAUM Honey, is something wrong? 
 He told me he loved me and I believed him. 
 DR. GREENBAUM Who told you? 
 You don't know him. I'm so stupid. 
 DR. GREENBAUM Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle. 
 Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet. 
 DR. GREENBAUM What kind of pictures? 
 Nudie pictures, what do you think? 
 DR. GREENBAUM Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid? 
 I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there. (she hears the phone drop) Mom? Are you there? Mom? (screaming) Mother!!!! 
 DR. GREENBAUM You son of a bitch. 
 You can't park there. 
 MRS. CALDWELL I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her. 
 I'll do my best. 
 What was that? 
 I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language. 
 (in French) You're too kind. 
 MRS. CALDWELL How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength? 
 I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I... (takes out her crucifix) turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works. 
 MRS. CALDWELL That's beautiful. 
 What are the boys like? 
 MRS. CALDWELL Cecile, is that the best you can do? (to Kathryn) You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before. 
 Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples. 
 MRS. CALDWELL Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse. 
 MRS. CALDWELL You remember my daughter, Cecile. 
 My father just took me on a trip to Australia. 
 Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall. 
 What year are you in? 
 But I thought high school is only four years. 
 MRS. CALDWELL I think we'll be going now. (to Kathryn) Thanks for all your help. 
 I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum. 
 Thanks. (to Sebastian) Nice meeting you. 
 MRS. CALDWELL Let's go, Cecile. Now! 
 I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing. 
 Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid. 
 Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you. 
 (V.O.) You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret Reynolds? 
 He didn't dump me. We had a parting of the ways. 
 (V.O.) I went to great lengths to please Court. Huge sacrifices were made on my part to keep him happy. 
 (V.O.) What do you think? 
 In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent. 
 (V.O.) None other than Cecile Caldwell. 
 I don't find this very funny, 
 Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered. 
 Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way. 
 I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery. 
 She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie. 
 Why not? 
 Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge? 
 I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas. 
 Jesus Christ, is she for real? 
 B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy. 
 You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league. 
 I'll think about it... 
 Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer? 
 Oh Sebastian. About that little wager of yours. 
 If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine. 
 I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married. 
 In English. (whispers in his ear) I'll fuck your brains out. 
 Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you. 
 (whispering) You can put it anywhere. 
 (baby talk) It would feel so yummy. 
 It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond. 
 Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding? 
 My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick. 
 I'm sorry about that. 
 My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time. 
 I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name? 
 Ben Schwarz. 
 Schwarz. Jewish? 
 German. 
 Doesn't ring a bell. 
 Thank you. It's so peaceful and quiet around here. 
 Sebastian must be here. 
 (O.S.) Sebastian! 
 I've missed you too. How are your parents? 
 Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison. She's going to be staying with me for a few weeks. 
 Anything for you, my dear. 
 SEBASTIAN & ANNETTE We will. 
 Junior. 
 No. 
 I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies. 
 (annoyed) No. 
 Are you often this offensive on a first encounter? 
 You did? 
 That's a first. Most people praised me for it. 
 I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions. 
 Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it? 
 A friend wrote me. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question. 
 It's not really important. 
 Why are you being so dramatic? 
 Alright, I said I was sorry. (beat) Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot. 
 (O.S.) That's good, that's good. 
 Oh, I suck. I suck. 
 Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Your playing was beautiful. 
 Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's giving me music lessons over the summer. 
 Pleased to meet you. 
 Likewise I'm sure. 
 Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera. 
 It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King. 
 Doctor King is my favorite. 
 I guess our hour's up. Same time tomorrow? 
 - none taken - 
 Any ideas who it could be? 
 Where did you say she's from? 
 Greg McConnell. 
 He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat. 
 I don't think that bothered him. 
 Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field. 
 I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know - (imitating Greg) "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything." (beat) It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover. 
 Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up. 
 Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight. 
 Don't think it's not going to cost you. 
 So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice. 
 He's alright. (giggles) He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July. 
 Really? Bulimic headcase. 
 What a loser she must be. (beat) Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend. 
 That's great. 
 You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared. 
 What are you scared of? 
 Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do? 
 Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends? 
 Eww. No. That's gross. 
 It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me. 
 Are you for real? 
 Do you want to learn or not? 
 I guess. It still sounds gross. 
 See that wasn't so bad. 
 It was nothing. 
 Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is. 
 (reluctant) Okay. 
 Eyes closed. 
 That was cool. 
 Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime. 
 What are you saying? 
 Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you. 
 Is it that obvious? 
 That's so romantic. Have you responded? 
 No. 
 Well do you like him? 
 I don't know. 
 Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me. 
 (beat) I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him. 
 Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never. 
 Okay. 
 Did you hide the letters? 
 Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room. 
 I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me. 
 Why? 
 Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house. 
 You'd do that for me? 
 Of course I would. We're friends, right? 
 Best friends. 
 (calling out) Excuse me. Excuse me! 
 Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read. 
 The Fountainhead. 
 (skeptical) You've read The Fountainhead? 
 Romantic? He rapes her. 
 You need help. 
 At this hour? I don't think so. 
 Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse. 
 Give me a minute. I'll be right down. 
 Fuck her yet? 
 Loser. 
 Call me later. 
 Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch. 
 SOOK-HEE Sorry. 
 Oops. 
 (holding out the letter) You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible. 
 This is my favorite part. (reading the letter) Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it. 
 I sincerely doubt it. 
 The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away. 
 How's the water? 
 About what? 
 I never said that. 
 Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time. 
 (caught off guard) Thank you. 
 (jokingly) Shut up. 
 Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work. 
 Because you act like a pig. 
 I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends. 
 I'm sorry, but you're not my type. 
 You're naked. 
 That's repulsive. 
 Get some manners. 
 (O.S.) (moaning) Oh baby... oh baby... 
 (near orgasm) Oh God... Oh God, I'm gonna cum. I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna... 
 Jesus! 
 (from under the covers) Get out of here. 
 I told you to lock the door. 
 I thought I did. 
 Look Valmont. This was the first time I've ever done something like this. I was -- 
 Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career. 
 Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes but not a fudge packer. 
 (to Sebastian) Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything. Let's just forget the whole thing. 
 Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about. 
 (sobbing) I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you. 
 I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter. 
 Our boy just can't get enough dick. 
 You sick son of a bitch. 
 No thank you. 
 Give it up. 
 I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me. 
 It was fine. 
 I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends. 
 And that's a bad thing? 
 I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior. 
 You don't even know me. 
 Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual. 
 I can't. I'm seeing a friend. 
 That's none of your business. 
 I'm busy. 
 That's also none of your business. 
 You truly want to do something to make me happy? 
 And you promise to abide by it? 
 Alright. (beat) I want you to leave and go back to New York. 
 If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends. 
 It's not about being happy. You and I can't - 
 He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before. 
 Really? I thought he said it all the time. 
 That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth. 
 Nothing. 
 Is there a mutual feeling between you two? 
 No. I mean. I don't know. (beat) What else do you know about him? 
 Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded. 
 (sighs) I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him. 
 From who? 
 I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy. 
 Annette, how long have we known each other? 
 Forever. 
 Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen? 
 You promise not to say anything? 
 On my mother's life. 
 (beat) Okay... 
 Positive. 
 Yes. 
 Yes! 
 Yes! 
 I'm pretty sure she did. 
 She bought it. 
 Enough with the music. Fuck her already. 
 Shhh. 
 (O.S.) Idiot! 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Interesting. 
 No. 
 The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher. 
 Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder. 
 I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo. 
 Cecile is planning to go away with Court next week. I'll need you to speed up her sexual awakenings. 
 Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good. 
 I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny. 
 I know. 
 Have you succeeded in your task? 
 Well, let me know when you do. Until then. 
 No, not at all. 
 I'm... I'm alright. 
 It wasn't a date. He's just a friend. 
 Wait, don't hang up. 
 What are you doing? 
 What are you reading? 
 Somerset Maugham. 
 You're not gonna start that again. 
 Sure. Have a good night. 
 Of Human Bondage. You're such a bullshit artist. 
 Duh, it's a book. 
 Who cares. Books are for fags. 
 Here's something you might like. 
 Do you carry any real fur? 
 No. All our fur is faux. 
 Of course. The animals. How silly of me. 
 MRS. CALDWELL I got your message and came as quick as I could. 
 I hope I didn't keep you from something. 
 MRS. CALDWELL Not at all. What's wrong? 
 It's Cecile. 
 MRS. CALDWELL What about her? 
 Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and... 
 MRS. CALDWELL Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it? 
 It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher. 
 MRS. CALDWELL Ronald? That's crazy. 
 I know. She's so young and he's so - 
 MRS. CALDWELL Black. 
 He's been sending her love letters that she hides under her doll house. I questioned whether or not to tell you, but something like this could destroy her reputation at Oakwood and I don't want to see her get hurt. 
 MRS. CALDWELL I can't thank you enough. 
 You will be discreet about this? 
 MRS. CALDWELL Absolutely. 
 Will that be cash or charge? 
 Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home. 
 MRS. CALDWELL Let me get that for you. 
 Oh please. I can't have you do that. 
 MRS. CALDWELL It's the least I can do. 
 Thank you. 
 MRS. CALDWELL Who the hell do you think you are?! 
 Excuse me. 
 MRS. CALDWELL I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child. 
 Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something. 
 MRS. CALDWELL Is that so? 
 Where did you find those? 
 MRS. CALDWELL Margarita found them while cleaning your room. 
 Those are my letters! 
 MRS. CALDWELL Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now. 
 Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park. 
 MRS. CALDWELL Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?! 
 First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines. 
 MRS. CALDWELL Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell. 
 (sarcastic) I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening. 
 (angry) Took me off the streets? 
 Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings. 
 (eyes tear up) She really loves me. 
 What do you do? Tell her you love her. 
 But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address. 
 How will I get to her? 
 SEBASTIAN & KATHRYN We'll make sure she gets it. 
 Why are you being so good to me? 
 Because we want to see Cecile happy and we know you make her happy. 
 Cecile. 
 I'm aware. 
 What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience. 
 Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day." (beat) I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out? 
 Finished. 
 You think he'll like it? 
 What are you doing? 
 I look terrible. 
 I'm getting out of here. 
 (scared) I want to go home. 
 (eyes watering) I want to go home. 
 My mom? Don't call my mom. 
 Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom. 
 And then I can go home? 
 Just a kiss, right? 
 What are you doing? 
 But - 
 MRS. CALDWELL Cecile are you up yet? We're gonna to be late for the - 
 (O.S.) I'm in the bath, mom. 
 MRS. CALDWELL Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch. 
 (O.S.) Okay. 
 MRS. CALDWELL It was nice of you to invite us up for the weekend, Helen. 
 More the merrier. (to Cecile) Is everything alright my dear? 
 I'm just not feeling well. 
 MRS. CALDWELL I didn't know you'd be here, Sebastian. 
 I better go check on them. 
 I'm doing some volunteer work. 
 You? Volunteer? I don't think so. 
 (smiling) Okay. 
 Please. I need you. I don't know what to do. You're the only one I can talk to. 
 I'll be there in a few hours. 
 It's really nice when the young people help out. Most of our patients don't have any family nearby. 
 MRS. SUGERMAN Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me - 
 MRS. SUGERMAN I did? 
 MRS. SUGERMAN We played backgammon? 
 MRS. SUGERMAN I did? 
 MRS. SUGERMAN Excuse me? 
 MRS. SUGERMAN Oh... no thank you... 
 How we doing in here? 
 MRS. SUGERMAN I won three games of backgammon. 
 Oh please. 
 "I actually feel good about myself?" 
 You must take me for a real idiot. 
 You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady. 
 That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person. 
 No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me. 
 It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously. 
 Lighten up. 
 Fine. 
 Oh dear, are you actually laughing? 
 No? 
 There's hope for you, yet. 
 Who is it? 
 (O.S.) It's Kathryn. 
 No. 
 Calm down. Tell me what's wrong. 
 Something awful happened last night. 
 What do you mean?! 
 I... I don't think you want to know. 
 Cecile, you have to tell me. 
 It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me. 
 Does your mother know? 
 If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night. 
 Why didn't you do something? 
 I don't know. 
 So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you. 
 Well... not exactly. 
 He made you give him a blow job. 
 No. 
 Well what then? 
 If that's what you call it. 
 Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did. 
 What do I do then? 
 Well did you like it? 
 Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one. 
 Cecile, you had an orgasm. 
 I did? 
 I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman. 
 I am? 
 Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you. 
 I don't love him. I love Ronald. 
 So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible. 
 But that would make me a slut. (beat) Wouldn't it? 
 Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it. 
 It's like a secret society. 
 That's one way of looking at it. 
 Cool. 
 I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems. 
 Who are you spying on? 
 That her? 
 Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley. (sarcastic) Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book. 
 What's your problem? 
 She's really getting to you, isn't she? 
 And that's why you're losing your bet? 
 Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride? 
 Not at all. Have a seat. 
 Florentino Ariza. 
 Who's Monsieur Philipe? 
 (laughs) Bonjour Monsieur Philipe. 
 Thank you. 
 I am too. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 I thought you said we were going to be friends. 
 I have feelings for you. 
 That's not fair. 
 You really want to know? 
 It's because I don't trust myself with you. (beat) I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please. 
 Want to join me? 
 Am I suppose to be this sore? 
 I like it better when I'm on top. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Is it me? 
 It's that girl, Annette. 
 Where are you going? 
 Need any company? 
 Want a blow job? 
 (under her breath) Prude. 
 Come in. 
 Where are you going? 
 I think that's for the best. 
 Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms. 
 How am I a hypocrite? 
 (sobbing) Please don't go. 
 I... I want you. 
 Morning! 
 So? How'd it go last night? 
 Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus? 
 She shot you down. 
 So what went wrong? 
 You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump. 
 If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her. 
 You don't know? (big smile) She left thirty minutes ago. 
 She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends. (beat) You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again. 
 Hello. 
 Who is this? 
 No. 
 I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone. 
 I told you I don't know. 
 Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central. 
 Hi. 
 I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house. (beat) Was it -- 
 (O.S.) Slower. 
 (O.S.) A little to the left. Look, pretend like you're writing the alphabet. A... B... mmm, stay on B. 
 (O.S.) One second. 
 (O.S.) Come in. 
 Kind of. 
 It's not what it seems like. 
 (calling out) Call me. 
 You didn't? 
 Tell me all the details. 
 Oh come on. For her first time? 
 No, tell me. 
 Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping. 
 So I assume you've come here to make some arrangements. 
 Excuse me? 
 And that's why you're leaving? 
 I want to fuck. 
 Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped. 
 P-whipped, p-whipped. 
 I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore. 
 At first it was, but now it's become something bigger. 
 Not anymore you don't. It's obvious. 
 Is that what you think? 
 Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away. 
 Why so nervous? 
 How have you dumped girls in the past? 
 I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." (beat) Poor fatty never had a chance. 
 Don't be weak. 
 MRS. O'SHEA You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you. 
 Hi. 
 MRS. O'SHEA Well, I'm going to head back to the kitchen. You two have fun. 
 Would you like a tour? 
 And this is my room. 
 (smiling) Yeah, me neither. 
 What are you saying? 
 I love you. 
 Why are you trying to hurt me? 
 You don't know how to love. 
 But you knew this was important to me. 
 Please go. 
 Jesus. 
 A little melodramatic, don't you think. 
 Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room? 
 Annette? 
 Well done. 
 I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company. 
 Not that it's any of your business but yes. 
 Well done. 
 To my triumph, of course. 
 Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you. 
 You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. (smiles) Cheers. 
 I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers. 
 Get off me! 
 Fine! Get off me! 
 I accept. Now get out. 
 Didn't you hear what I said? 
 (screaming) Get out! 
 And if I don't? 
 I think you have your answer. 
 MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.) I've already told you, she's not home. 
 MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.) I'll do that. 
. 
 MRS. O'SHEA What do you want? 
 MRS. O'SHEA She's not here. 
 MRS. O'SHEA She's out. 
 MRS. O'SHEA Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so - 
 MRS. O'SHEA Young man, I already told you she's not here. 
 MRS. O'SHEA I'll do that. 
 MRS. O'SHEA I understand. Good night. 
 Hello. 
 (voice cracking) Ronald? 
 Yeah? 
 It's Kathryn. 
 Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay? 
 No. 
 What's wrong? 
 It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind. 
 What do you mean? 
 I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over. 
 I'll be right there. 
 And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got... 
 And this happened before you and I hooked up? 
 It's been going on for a while. (beat) Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me. 
 Racist piece of shit. 
 I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to. 
 He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in. 
 Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and -- 
 Don't worry about it. I'll stay. 
 Thanks Ronald. You're a good friend. 
 Eight o'clock. You got to go. 
 Nope. 
 I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 (under his breath) Son of a bitch. 
 It seems that you and I have some talking to do. 
 Where the hell do you come off hitting women? 
 Kathryn. Did you hit her? 
 Did you hit her? 
 Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile. 
 You bastard! 
 (pointing) Sebastian! 
 Get an ambulance! 
 MRS. CALDWELL Sad, sad, sad. To think of the opportunities that boy had. This should be a lesson to us all that our children need constant supervision. 
 (O.S.) He loved that view. 
 I can see why. 
 I'm Kathryn. 
 Annette Harrison. 
 Have we met? 
 I don't think so. 
 Did you know Sebastian well? 
 You might say that. 
 Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood. 
 That's right. 
 I'm sure you're going to love it there. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'll be fine. 
 (beat) Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine. 
 Thank you. 
 Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I... (takes out her crucifix) turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but - 
 Oh cut the shit, Kathryn. 
 Excuse me? 
 You heard me. 
 Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect. 
 Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian. 
 Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he - 
 I have his journal. 
 You what? 
 His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there. 
 You didn't show it to anybody? 
 Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride? 
 You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.

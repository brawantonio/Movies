 "FINAL DESTINATION" 
 Alex... 
 Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave that on. It's like... the tag made the last flight without crashin' or anything, right? So, it should stay on, or with, the bag for good luck. 
 Where would you get a nutball idea like that? 
 
 
 
 
 P.A. (V.O.) (overlapping) Attention airline travelers... 
 P.A. (V.O.) This airport does not support solicitors... 
 AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.) (CONT'D) You are not required to give money to solicitors. 
 MR. WAGGNER Alright, you guys got everything? 
 Yeah, we're all set Dad. 
 MR. MURNAU Les estudients, allons en France! 
 MR. WAGGNER Does that mean "go?" 
 P.A. (V.O. Atencion senores pasajeros. No es necesario contribuir... 
 MR. WAGGNER I'll miss you guys. 
 MR. WAGGNER Take care of those two, Alex. 
 I will. Don't worry. 
 I didn't think anything could worse than my yearbook picture. 
 Now you know how I feel havin' to look at you all the time. 
 P.A.  (V.O.) Avis aux passagers... 
 MR. MURNAU Entendez classe, qu'est ce que c'est l'announce? 
 AIRPORT P.A. (O.S. CONT'D) Vous n'etes pas dans l'obligation de contribuer aux demandes des quemandeurs. 
 
 (re: MURNAU) What the fuck's he want? 
 P.A. SYSTEM (O.S., CONT'D) cher aeroport n'est responsable pour leurs activities. 
 MR. MURNAU Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit! 
 Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with that shit the whole time? 
 Death is not the end. 
 MS. LEWTON It will be for you if you harass my students. 
 (pissy) Hare Rama. 
 MS. LEWTON (mouths) Fuck off. 
 I have a few questions to ask you this afternoon. 
 
 
 Have you recieved any packages from persons unknown to you? 
 
 Same as your birthday. 
 His parents bought a ton of those trip certificates we had to sell, just to get him out of their hair for ten days. 
 Dude, I so worked the ticket clerk so you're sittin' next to Christa and I'm next to Blake. 
 TOD (CONT'D) That's seven hours and most of it is in the dark. 
 Dude, if we don't get someone going on this flight, we should just call Dr. Kervorkian and put ourselves out of our fuckn' misery. 
 ALEX'S POV - 747 
 
 (O.S.) Dude, let's take a dump. 
 Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay. 
 Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torgue a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake? You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes? 
 John Denver... 
 (O.S.) He was born in the summer of his twenty-seventh year... 
 He died in a plane crash. 
 P.A. Ladies and Gentlemen, thank-you for your patience, at this time we would like to begin pre-boarding of Euro-Air Flight 180 to Paris through gate 39. 
 (O.S.) It's the Colorado Rocky Mountian High/ I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky... 
 
 
 MS. LEWTON Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock? How'd we lose him? 
 MR. MURNAU Vingt huit, vingt neuf... 
 
 
 
 Good sign. Younger the better. It would be a fucked-up God to take down this plane. 
 A REALLY fucked-up God. 
 
 (O.S.) Alex? 
 Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together? I asked Tod, but he says he's got some medical thing? 
 
 (mouths) Fag. 
 C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something? 
 Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom." 
 
 
 
 (V.O) Flight Attendants prepare for departure. 
 
 
 
 
 (V.O.) Fasten seat belts...put on oxygen masks... 
 
 
 KA-BOOM 
 (O.S.) Alex? 
 
 Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together? I asked Tod, but he's got some medical thing. 
 Dude, what up? 
 
 Is there a a problem, sir? 
 What's your fuckin' problem? 
 MR. MURNAU Alex? Qu'est-ce se? 
 Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA 
! 
 CARTER                TERRY Shut up, Browning!       You're not funny. 
 
 We have to get out! 
 ALEX (CONT'D) We have to get off this plane! 
 
 ALEX (CONT'D) Now! NOW!! 
 
 Sit! DOWN! Browning! 
 I'm not joking! I'm not joking! 
 Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off! 
 Sir, we will remove you from the aircraft if this continues. 
 I'll remove him. 
 Fuck you! I'll remove myself! 
 He didn't do nothin'! 
 (he's had it) Anybody in the aisle is off the plane! 
 
 CO-PILOT You got this? 
 CO-PILOT No one gets back on board. That's my call. 
 MS. LEWTON PLEASE... I've got forty students going to Paris... 
 
 It's alright. It's alright. You're off the plane. You're off the plane... 
 MS. LEWTON Airline's not taking this very well. They'll let one of us back on and the rest can grab a six-ten flight. Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle. It's alright. It's not that big of a deal. 
 MR. MURNAU I'll stay. 
 MS. LEWTON No, you know the whole French thing. Get on the plane. 
 I called your mom and dad and they're on their way. 
 MS. LEWTON Alex, talk to me. What happened? 
 I... I saw it... like, I don't know... the plane took off. I saw it leave the runway... I looked down and saw the ground... 
 ALEX (CONT'D) And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes. 
 Been on many planes that blew up, have you? 
 MS. LEWTON You must have fallen asleep. 
 We get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in Paris because Browning has a bad dream? (mocking Alex) It's going to explode! It's going to explode! 
 Fuck off, Horton. 
 MS. LEWTON Tod... 
 Only trip you're gonna take is to the fuckin' hospital. 
 
 
 You're payin' for my trip, Browning! 
 I wish you were on the plane! 
 
 39 
 
 
 You're lookin' at me as if I caused it. I did not cause this. 
 MS. LEWTON Is everyone dead? Are there any survivors? 
 
 How would I know? You think I'm some sort of... 
 
 Hello. I'm Howard Seigel, National Transportation Safety Board vice chairmen. We've notified your families and they are on their way. Does anyone feel they need medical attention or spiritual counseling at this time? 
 MS. LEWTON Have they found any survivors? What's going on? 
 The cause of the explosion is undetermined. Nassau county authorities are on the scene. Naval search and rescue are en route. 
 We understand how you must be feeling at this hour... and although we know it may be difficult, we must ask you some questions... regarding today's events, while it's still fresh in your minds. 
 It may be valuable to our rescue attempts, or any potential... criminal investigation. 
 
 You said... (checks notes) "Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off." (to Alex) How did you know that? 
 
 I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it... 
 Did you take any seditives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills? 
 No. I saw it. I saw it! 
 Not like a dream... more than that. I experienced the plane exploding... it was so horrible... I know what they all went through tonight... 
 ALEX (CONT'D) I'm not a pyschic... I've never had this happen before... 
 Did this "weird feeling" have anything to do with you saying you wished Carter Horton was on the plane... just before it exploded? 
 No! 
 Why'd you say it? 
 Because... I... never thought it would really happen. 
 If that's the case, Alex... why did you really get off the plane? 
 My brother... told me to keep an eye on Alex. He stayed... and I went to make sure Alex was okay. (a whisper) He told me to get off the plane. 
 MS. LEWTON Larry Murnau told me to get back on... but I told him to go. (pause, guiltily) I sent him back on the plane. 
 No one forced you to get off the plane. You told us you aren't friends with any that did... so, why did you leave the airplane? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (V.O.) Thirty-nine days have passed since we've lost our thirty-nine loved ones, friends, and teachers. 
 MINISTER (CONT'D) As each day passes without a determining cause for the accident, we ask ourselves, "Why?" 
 MINISTER (CONT'D) Ecclesiastes tell us, "Man no more knows his time than fish taken in the fatal net... 
 
 MINISTER (CONT'D) ...or birds trapped in the snare... 
 MINISTER (CONT'D) ...like these the children of men... 
 
 MINISTER (CONT'D) ...caught when the Time falls suddenly upon them." 
 
 MINISTER (CONT'D O.S.) And so before we can heal, before we can escape the presence of Death Time, we must mourn and celebrate theirs with this memorial. 
 
 
 Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything. 
 I don't. 
 (re: victims) All I owe is these people. (turns to Alex) To live my life to the fullest. 
 Then maybe you should lay off the J.D. 
 Don't ever fucking again tell me what to do. I control me. Not you. 
 I'm never gonna die. 
 Not here, not now. (beat) Not EVER! 
 
 Ms. Lewton... 
 MS. LEWTON Don't talk to me. You scare the hell out of me. 
 (a greeting) Hey. 
 I don't want to sound gay, or nothin, but... I miss you. 
 
 Me, too. (beat) But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks. 
 That's a plan. 
 I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton showed me in her class, they're gonna let me read it. It says what I'm feeling. 
 (V.O.) We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast... 
 TOD (CONT'D) But when we say this, we imagine that the hour is placed in an obscure and distant future. 
 
 
 
 TOD (CONT'D) It never occurs to us that it has any connection with the day already begun or that death could arrive this same afternoon. 
 TOD (V.O., CONT'D) This afternoon... which is so certain... and which has every hour filled in advance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (V.O.) And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun. 
 
 
 
 
 TOD'S NECK 
 
 
 TOD'S EYES 
 
 TOD'S FACE 
 
 
 
 What happened? Is Tod alright? 
 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) (a warning) Get outta here! 
 
 What... what happened? 
 MR. WAGGNER Didn't you... "see" it? 
 Mr. Waggner... 
 MR. WAGGNER You caused Tod so much guilt over George staying on the plane that... (breaking down) He took his own life. 
 He wouldn't do it! 
 He... he told me we would be friends again after you got better. After you got over George. Why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself? 
 MR. WAGGNER All my wife and I will ever know is we wouldn't have lost our youngest son... if you'd told our oldest to get off the plane. 
 
 It's only the end of June. 
 Like, um... you're mad about something? 
 You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits. 
 Why were you there last night? 
 Why were you there last night? 
 I'm... really sorry. 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) Before that day, you were just another suburban nothing that would never have anything to do with my life. And I'm sure you thought I was some Marilyn Manson body-pierced freak, or whatever. (beat) But at that moment... on the plane... I felt what you felt. I didn't know where all those emotions were coming from until you started freaking out. 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) I didn't see what you saw, but I felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that X-Files bullshit... but it was a psychic connection. Why to me? Why to you? 
 I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere. 
 What if Tod... is just the first... of us? 
 I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know. 
 This place?! 
 That... him? 
 That's him, but... he's not here. That... whatever... that whatever made him Tod is gone. 
 MR. BLUDWORTH (O.S.) Please don't yell... 
 MR. BLUDWORTH 
 MR. BLUDWORTH You'll wake the dead. 
 Why..? 
 MR. BLUDWORTH Chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasm. 
 I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father... 
 MR. BLUDWORTH (ominous) I know who you are. The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area. 
 MR. BLUDWORTH I crafted a reconstruction of the Laryngeal prominence region with Velvetone Surgical Wax and Permaseal. 
 What are all those tiny marks? 
 MR. BLUDWORTH (V.O.) Cuticle lacerations. 
 
 Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide? 
 His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son. 
 MR. BLUDWORTH In Death... 
 MR. BLUDWORTH ... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps. (smiles) And no... escapes. 
 You saying Tod did kill himself? 
 MR. BLUDWORTH Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What does it matter? He was going to end someday. From the minute you're cut loose from the womb... it's a one way ticket on a trip to the tomb. 
 MR. BLUDWORTH You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave. 
 Design? 
 MR. BLUDWORTH If Life is like a box of chocolates... Death... Death is like a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse Trap." The day you're born is just the boot, hanging from the streetlamp, kicking the marble to get things rolling. Growing up is only the marble rolling down the curving chute. You feel immortal having survived school, sex, drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really only upset the big hand holding the steel ball that falls into the bathtub. Marriage and kids and career seem to make it all worthwhile until the ball hits the see-saw and flips the diving man into the big barrel. In the old folks home or the hospital you just see the big cage rattling down until it captures... the mouse. (beat) Game over. 
 Maybe there's no way to win... but... if you figured out the game... you knew where the "steel ball was rolling" couldn't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time? Couldn't you... cheat Death at Its own game? 
 MR. BLUDWORTH You already did that by walking off the plane. Now you gotta out when and how it'll come back at you. (beat) Play your hunch, Alex. If you think you can get away from it. (beat) But beware the risk of cheating the plan, disrespecting the design... could iniciate a horrifying fury that would terrorize even the Grim Reaper. (beat) And you don't even want to fuck with that Mack Daddie. 
 I'm sorry we broke in. 
 MR. BLUDWORTH No harm. No foul. 
 Yeah, we did. 
 MR. BLUDWORTH 
 MR. BLUDWORTH I'll see you soon. 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) He was trippin' on formaldehyde. 
 He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns. 
 How many died on Flight 180? From our group? 
 Remember the gate number? 
 Thirty-nine. 
 Remember the departure time? 
 (V.O.) Do you know when I was born? 
 
 Right. April 25th. 
 
 My birthday is the same as of the time I was meant to die! That's a reach!? 
 I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane. 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) Hey, look! "Coffee" starts with a "C" and ends with an "E." So does the word "choke!" We're going to choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was a whaler. We're going to be harpooned! 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) You'll go nuts if you start with that shit. 
 Clear, how do we know that by just sitting here, breathing this air or sipping the coffee, having crossed the street... we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death? Fifty years from now. Ten years. Tomorrow. (beat) You don't unless... you're able to open yourself to the signs I'm willing to show you. 
 CARTER'S CAR 
 No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design. 
 The mortician said Death has a design. Now... if you, me, Tod, Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton messed up that design, because, for whatever reason, I was able to see Death's plan... then we cheated it. (beat) But what if it was our time, what if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it is still is our time? If... It... is still not finished with us? We will all still die; now, not later. 
 ALEX (CONT'D) Unless... we find the pattern. And cheat it again. 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) ...that Tod killed himself. 
 Then there's no one left who can help me. 
 CARTER'S CAR 
 
 
 Baby, come on... not now. 
 Carter... 
 Kind of have a reunion, here. 
 Let it go! 
 When are you moving? 
 MS. LEWTON A couple of weeks. 
 We're losing our favorite teacher. 
 Look, there's something you should all know. 
 Shut up! The both of you! 
 TERRY (CONT'D) They died! We lived! (beat) Get over it! I won't let that plane crash be the most important thing in my life. I'm moving on, Carter, and if you're gonna waste your life beating the shit out of Alex everytime you see him, then you can just drop fucking dead! 
 
 KEN (CONT'D) She's concerned about you. (beat) I'm concerned about you. 
 KEN (CONT'D) Why don't you want to talk to her... or me? 
 Dad... you and mom have helped me out, so much. But there's... some things I need to understand before I can talk... to anyone about it. 
 (O.S.) The National Transportation Safety Board has a new theory tonight on the possible cause of Euro-Air Flight 180... 
 
 
 (O.S.) That's Tod's seat... 
 
 
 
 The path of the explosion... (a whisper) That's Death's design. 
 MS. LEWTON (O.S.) Some nights I'm woken up by the sound of my own voice, you know, inside my head, goin', "No, you know the whole French thing. Get on the plane." 
 MS. LEWTON (quickly) Laura, I gotta call you back. 
 What are you doing? 
 
 Checking the air in her tires to make sure they're safe. 
 Get in the car. 
 I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next. 
 "Next?" 
 Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring. 
 (sarcastic) Oh, you've noticed it, too? 
 MS. LEWTON Oh... mom's favorite. 
 (V.O.) He was born in the summer of his twenty-seventh year... 
 Where'd you get this "pattern" from? You have another "vision?" Maybe saw it in some T.V. static? 
 I didn't ask for what happened to me on the plane. You can make fun of me. You can think I'm a nut. I'm used to it. I saved six lives but the entire school acts like I'm a freak. Fine. 
 I'm not suffering from Post Traumatic Stress. I haven't developed a narcissistic deity complex. I'm not going Dahmer. (beat) This just is. There's a pattern in place for you. And you. There's a design for everyone. 
 (sighs) And I'm not sure yet how... but I intend to break this one. 
 
 (V.O.) He left yesterday behind him/ You might say he's born again... 
 Alex, you got our attention, at first, because you were under suspicion in the plane explosion. 
 WEINE (CONT'D) I know you didn't blow up that plane. 
 WEINE (CONT'D) I don't believe you have magical powers. No one has any... control over life and death... unless... that person is taking lives and causing death. 
 WEINE (CONT'D) Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die? 
 No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control. 
 Alright, go on. Get outta here. 
 Kid gives me the creeps. 
 We got nothing to hold him. 
 I don't mean that... (beat) There's a couple of times, there... I almost believed him. 
 Sometimes, you give me the creeps. 
 (V.O.) When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away... 
 MS. LEWTON 
 A 
 MS. LEWTON 
 MS. LEWTON You gotta stop this! Stop this! It's just a stupid mug. (composed) You're outta here. Pretty soon... you'll be gone. 
 
 (V.O.) It's the Colorado Rocky Mountain High... 
 MS. LEWTON 
 I've seen it rainin' fire from the sky... 
 MS. LEWTON 
 MS. LEWTON 
 MS. LEWTON 
 (V.O.) Rocky Mountain High/ Colorad-oh. 
 
 
 MS. LEWTON 
 
 (O.S.) Ms. Lewton! 
 
 MS. LEWTON 
 (V.O.) They say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun... 
 MS. LEWTON 
 MS. LEWTON 
 
 Ms. Lewton! 
 
 
 Why? 
 If he should contact you, it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us. 
 Terry's name should be on this wall. 
 CARTER (CONT'D) So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now? 
 Why would I want to see him? 
 Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one... 
 'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya! 
 (O.S.) Are they up there? 
 
 ALEX (CONT'D) Somehow... is 180 still in flight? Somewhere... are they still safe? 
 Most kids do, I guess. 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) And, let me tell ya, I had every reason to worry before... because life became shit. I don't blame her, I guess, but my mom couldn't deal with it at all. She married this asshole, who my mom with my real dad would cross the street to avoid this guy. He really didn't want a kid. And so my mom didn't either anymore, I guess. (beat) If that was the design for my father... and my family... then fuck Death, FUCK IT! 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) And so, anyway... I've thought of that "somewhere," Alex. It exists, that place. 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) Where my dad is still safe. Where he had a full pack of cigerettes and kept driving. A place where me and my dad and my mom... are still together....and have no idea about this second life, here. (beat) A place where our friends are still in the sky... where everyone gets a second chance. 
 CLEAR (CONT'D) But that place might only exist in my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I haven't experienced too many second chances in my life. I haven't seen any. But because of all of this, I believe... because of you... I will get a second chance. Because of me, you will. With you in my life... that place, right now existing in our hearts, will spring out... and become a real part of this life. 
 This won't be safe. 
 No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe. 
 I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me. 
 Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what? 
 Why do you think I was hiding? 
 They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash... 
 I already told you... 
 (interrupting) I'm not talkin' about if you did it. Or if you knew she was dead... (beat) Did you know she was going to be next... before she was? 
 (quietly) Yeah. (almost to himself) When she died... at that moment, I could tell she saw something... horrible. 
 Out of us... who's next to see it? 
 Me, right? That's why you're not saying. 
 (to Billy) Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm next. 
 You have a responsibility to tell me. 
 Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder. 
 You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it. 
 It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list. 
 Aww, fuck... really? 
 Then why bother? What's the fuckin' point? Terry and me will be back together on the other side, so why wait any longer? 
 May as well go out under my own free will, right? 
 What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right? 
 That's what I'm doin'! 
 I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death! 
 CLEAR                   ALEX Stop the car!              Let us out! 
 Billy, get out! 
 
 CLEAR                          ALEX Can't you open the door?!      Easy, Billy, just open it. 
 ALEX                         BILLY Don't do it! Don't do it!      It's coming! It's coming! 
 It ain't my time. 
 
 
 I can't get out! 
 CARTER'S CAR 
 
 It broke! 
 
 SHUT UP, BILLY! 
 FUCK YOU, BILLY! I'M NOT DEAD! 
 
 Jesus fucking Christ! 
 (to Carter) You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead. 
 You're the fuckin' devil. 
 (to Clear) But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design. 
 That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy. 
 ALEX (CONT'D) My intervention in the death of 180 surviviors will cheat the design. 
 "Intervention?" What are you, God now?! 
 Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do! 
 After Billy... it's me. And then you. 
 ALEX (CONT'D) (to Clear) Hey, I won't let it happen, okay. 
 Then, get out of here. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (as if to Death) Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch. (defiant) I overlooked it. You tried to capitalize. But I caught you, you fuck. I can beat you. Not forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you NOW! 
 
 She was up there a minute ago... 
 You can't. 
 Tell us where he is. Wait at home, and I promise... we'll bring him back safe, in protective custody. 
 
 I... never moved. Christa asked me to move, but I didn't change seats. I would've moved up... next to Tod... How could I not remember... that... I never moved. Clear's seat was in front of mine... 
 ALEX (CONT'D) She's next. 
 There! 
 
 
 A 
 
 
 
 
 
 (into radio) Lost him. 
 From the direction... there's only one place he can heading... 
 
 A 
 
 Don't move! 
 
 You're grounded in the car. Don't touch anything. DON'T MOVE. 
 Alex, get away from there! 
 Any part of that line touches you, you're dead. 
 
 
 
 
 
 NO! 
 Get back! You'll both die! 
 You know what to do. 
 When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over. 
 You know what to do. I'll always be with you. 
 
 
 
 NO! 
 
 Is he alive? 
 CLEAR'S EYES 
 CLEAR - OVERHEAD 
 A little more. Little more!

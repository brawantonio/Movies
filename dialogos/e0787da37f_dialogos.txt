 "MINORITY REPORT" 
 
 (frightened woman) 
 JOHNNY, PLEASE 
 (mocking man) "Johnny, please.  Johnny please." 
 You're scaring me. 
 (child's voice) DADDY, DON'T. DADDY 
 (considering) I don't like you any more, Carol. 
 (imploring) Put the scissors down.  You're scaring me.  Please. 
 Oh, Carol. 
 Johnny!  Stop! 
 Don't grab at me!  Let 
 Daddy!  No! 
 (gruff) Why'd you let me sleep so long? 
 It's Saturday, Johnny, you always -- (beat) Why are you staring at me like that? 
 I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so long. 
 ON - A GLOVE 
 
 I didn't do anything! 
 1 Come out of the closet on your hands and knees. 
 1 Hands and knees! 
 I didn't... 
 2 POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER. 
 1 (to Johnny) John Palmer, if you were being arrested for any other crime, I would now read you your rights. (beat) But you are under arrest for the future murderer of your wife, Carol Palmer.  You have no rights. 
 Thought we might a had a runner. 
 Yeah, a runner. 
 A little chase -- that'd been good. 
 Fifty cops on the scene takes the chase out of them. 
 (smiles) But only eight of us were real. 
 We ever get a runner, I'd be too old to give chase. 
 You'd chase.  You'd love it,.  Man. 
 I love it more Johnny boy doesn't get to murder his wife. 
 (beat) It's a beautiful world. 
 Jesus, Paul.  Your heart's hammering. (playfully) I excite you that much? 
 I used to love being a cop. 
 You're still a cop.  I'm a factory worker.  We don't catch murderers. We process them. 
 You're the best homicide cop in the country. 
 Great -- except there's no such thing as homicide.  What I do best doesn't exist anymore. 
 
. (beat) You're the Director of a perfect system.  A Cop with a perfect record 
 The Precogs have a perfect record. They identify the accused -- I just put on my monkey suit and go round them up. 
 And then I prosecute them.  And they go to jail.  And lives are saved. Thousands of lives. (beat) And that's a cop's dream. 
 No.  You're a cop's dream. 
 
 Who called? 
 No one.  I called about my hair. Getting it done this afternoon. 
 Come on in, neighbor.  Want some coffee? 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO Brought these for your supper. 
 Oh, Frank.  That's so sweet.  Thank you. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO Sweet, nothing.  I gotta get rid of these things.  One plant, and I'm invaded by tomatoes.  When I was a kid ... 
 Before all this genetically engineered crap ... 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO Yeah well, it's true.  It used to be a challenge to grow things.  An art. Now you put one plant in the ground -- then jump the hell out of the way. 
 Coffee? 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO Nah, thanks.  Can't stay.  You guys are rushing off to work anyway. 
 You and Ellie come for supper then. 
 We'll barbecue. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO You betcha.  We'll bring some more tomatoes -- a new batch will have grown by then. 
 Yes, Director Anderson? 
 Where's Ennis Page?  Why hasn't he delivered this morning's Precog discs? 
 I'll find him, sir. 
 Bullying the staff again, Director Anderson? 
 Screw you. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Was that fun for you, yesterday? 
 The Johnny Palmer bust? 
 Yeah. 
 It was okay.  We got our man. 
 When do we not get our man? 
 Sorry I'm late, sir.  Precogs put out a heavy national volume this morning -- four for our zone. 
 (DISTRACTED) Put the case on my desk, Ennis. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) What was I thinking. 
 Thanks, Ennis. 
 Now that's a guy who really cares. 
 
 Welcome to the main headquarters of Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United States. 
 MR. HARRIS Three.  Uh, right? 
 That's exactly right!  A lot of people assume there are Precogs in every branch office. (MORE) 
 They protect us. 
 (chipper voice) That's right, Timmy.  Because of the Precogs, you're going to grow up murderfree.  Isn't that something? 
 MR. HARRIS They ever wrong?  The Precogs ever screw up when they predict a murder? 
 Never, sir.  It's an infallible system.  The Precogs predict a homicide, and our Precrime police then apprehend that future murderer before the event occurs.  And right next door is the Judicial Center, where we prosecute the future murderers. 
 Can we see the Precogs? 
 No, I'm sorry.  That part of the building is not open to the public. (beat) Now, if you'll just step this way ... 
 What would they think about if we unhooked them? 
 They don't think, sir.  They just see. 
 PAGE (CONT'D) They're not even alive, really. 
 Director Anderson, do you swear that the disc you now present to the court is the only and authentic disc of the future murder of Carol Palmer by her husband, John Palmer? 
. 
 Yes.  This is the only and authentic disc of the event seen by the Precognitive mutants and recorded by the Precrime Division.  This is the immutable evidence of the infallible system. 
 The murder of Carol Palmer will occur ... ? 
 In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at 10:33 in the morning. 
 Johnny, please -- 
 "Johnny, please.  Johnny please." 
 You're scaring me. 
 JOHNNY'S SON DADDY, DON'T.  DADDY 
 (considering) I don't like you any more, Carol. 
 (imploring) Put the scissors down.  You're scaring me. Please. 
 (O.S.) Oh, Carol. 
 (O.S.) Johnny!  Stop! 
 (O.S.) Don't grab at me!  Let go... 
 JOHNNY'S SON (O.S.) Daddy!  No! 
 I didn't do it.  I'm innocent!  It didn't happen! 
 How does the defense plead? 
 The defense acknowledges the infallibility of the system.  We are Guilty.  We throw ourselves at the mercy of the court. 
 No! No! The Precogs are wrong!  No! 
 (to Anderson) Looks like the old days. 
 That would be bad news for an infallible system. 
 We know it can't be a murder -- the Precogs would've seen it.  Why do you insist on coming to these things? 
 Keeps the system honest.  And besides, I like to pretend I'm a cop. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Who's got the Coroner? 
 Right here, sir. 
 Hi DOC. 
 Hello, Director Anderson. 
 This a homicide, Doc? 
 I'm presently analyzing neurohormones, Assistant Director Witwer.  I have not concluded my examination. 
 Bingo.  The guy put the gun to his own head. 
 I have not determined that yet, Assistant Director. 
 You have good ears for a ghost, Doc. 
 Please rotate the corpse to the lateral supine position. 
 Can you imagine if this was a homicide?  Who even knows how to hunt down a killer any more? 
 I know how, dammit.  You know how. 
 Easy, partner. (beat) But you know what I'm saying.  The state legislatures are pushing to stop funding for training homicide detectives ... 
 God bless the Precogs. 
 This event is a negative homicide. A mortal wound was generated by a .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to the parietal 'portion of the skull on June 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm, (MORE) 
 It's time to stop coming to these, partner. 
 Yeah.  You're right. 
 A little bit of me dies every time I come to one of these things. 
 It's only a party, Paul. 
 I'd never have let them appoint me to Precrime if I'd have known this was going to be part of it. 
 You're exactly what Precrime needed. An amazing homicide cop and a real person in an unreal job. 
 
 The public loves the Precogs.  But they give people the creeps, too.  You're something they understandp a regular cop running things. 
 Let's invite all these irregular assholes over for a barbecue.  Burgers and beer - think they'd come? 
 I'd come, Mr. Director.  And I'd make all the other assholes come with me. 
 I have a dream, Paul. 
 I know you do, Senator. 
 Hundreds of Precogs.  Not just predicting murders, but predicting all crimes.  Burglary, arson, assaults ... 
 How about jaywalking?  Littering? Now there's a crime. 
 I don't want a police state, you know that.  But we have an opportunity here, and 
 No sir, we don't have that opportunity.  There are only three Precogs.  They're a lucky accident of nature.  There are no more. 
 (beat) We can make more.  Just give me your support.  Help me increase funding for the Precog Engineering Project. 
 Precogs aren't sheep or pigs.  Seeing into the future is a gift, a nonreproducible event. (MORE) 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) There was only one Mozart, and there are only three Precogs. 
 Fuck Mozart.  The people want to be safe.  They want that more than they want food or love. 
 Senator, a world filled with hundreds of Precogs is not my idea of a safe place. 
 Sure could use your help, Paul. 
 I decline, Senator.  I'm sorry. 
 (icily) Don't think I'll come to your barbecue after all. 
 DR. RESFIELD You don't get out here much. 
 Not my sort of place. 
 DR. RESFIELD The head of Precrime squeamish? 
 When it comes to needles and scalpels, yeah. 
 DR. RESFIELD I promise we won't use any on you. 
 What do you use them on? 
 DR. RESFIELD (beat) On bits of this and that. 
 What's happening here? 
 DR. RESFIELD We're in an interesting phase. 
 What's in the cylinders? 
 DR. RESFIELD Neurotissue. 
 From ...? 
 DR. RESFIELD A fusion of sources.  From the Precogs' deceased mother.  From the Precogs themselves. 
 A fusion of ... ? 
 DR. RESFIELD In lay terms, we mated sperm from the brothers with ova from the mother and sister to create new growth. 
. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO What are you doing, playing hooky? 
 It's great out here, Frank.. You got the touch. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO I got the arthritis, is what I got. 
 Sure, Frank.  Yeah. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (distracted) I thought I'd buried it all. Thirty-five years -- all those minutes and days to bury it. (beat) But suddenly you see the man who murdered your daughter walking the streets -- my God it throws you. 
 He'd served his time, Frank.  I know it's not fair.  It's way beyond not fair ... 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (yells) God damn the Precogs.  You know? Why couldn't they have been around to save my girl? (softly) Now they're catching me. 
 Next Wednesday, at noon. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO Good. 
 It's not in you, Frank, to kill anybody. 
 FRANK D'IGRAZIO Tell it to the Precogs.  It's set in stone now, right? 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (almost inaudible) I don't want to be a part of this world anymore. 
 I know, Frank. 
 FRANK D'IGNAZIO (beat) So.  Tell me, Paul.  Do the Precogs see everything? 
 No. 
 FRANK D'IGRAZIO Then they won't have seen this. 
 (GENTLY) We had to bring him in. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) He was a future murderer. 
 (angrily) You blame him?  The guy killed his daughter! 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Yeah.  I know.  I know. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in them absolutely and I hate them absolutely.  Jesus. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) And that goddamn lab trying to grow more of them.  Put a Precog in every home, you know?  So we can have more Franks - people shooting themselves -- over who knows what? 
 Precrime did the job it was supposed to do. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) You know it.  And you believe in it. 
 ANDERSON (BEAT) Yeah. 
 It's not easy.  It beats us down. Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates you right now. 
 That's why I got into this business -- to be hated. 
 They hated us when we were regular cops.  Now we're Precrime, and they still hate US.  It's one of the little perks of law enforcement nobody knows about. 
 (O.S.) Let's not do this, Ed. 
 Oh, Ed ... 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) I kill you. (beat) Oh god, I kill you. 
 Sir? 
 Come in.  Angela. 
 Need you to sign these.  And your eleven o'clock starts in five minutes. 
 My ... eleven. 
 (beat) Budget coordination with the FBI. (beat) You okay, sir? 
 Have Page take this. 
 But sir, the procedure 
 ANDERSON (SNAPS) I make procedure.  Call him. (long beat) I'm not okay, Angela ... you're right. 
 Yes sir. 
 I'll speak to Witwer, put him in charge for the rest of the day. 
 Breaking and entering.  That'll get you five to ten, hard. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) What's wrong? 
 Paul? 
 Take over for me today? 
 You sick? 
 Yeah. 
 Don't give it to me.  You probably have that Trans-10 virus going around. A stomach thing.  I hate stomach things. 
 Ed. 
 Yeah? 
 Run the place, okay? 
 (smiles) Sure.  Right into the ground. (beat) Go on home before I call Infectious Control and have them spray you down with something. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) You want me to do the discs, or hold them for you to review when you get back? 
 Can't let them back up.  Do 'em. 
 Call you later.  Take it easy, all right? 
 Paul? 
 Listen to me. 
 I can hardly hear you. 
 I'm underground.  Weakens the signal so it can't be picked up. 
 But we're on Secure 
 Listen, dammit!  I'm going to murder Ed. 
 Paul.  Paul His crackling voice faintly comes through the phone. 
 ANDERSON'S VOICE ... home. 
 Hello, sir. 
 What's your name, officer? 
 Bob, uh, Robert Smythe. 
 These the new Python transports? 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) (sincerely) Sorry, Officer Smythe. 
 Don't move. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Stop!  Moving heats you up, makes it easier for them to pick you up on their thermals. 
 It's a hundred degrees in here. 
 I turned the furnace all the way up. Your hair dryer.  The oven.  If they come, it'll buy me twenty seconds. Maybe thirty. 
 Nobody's coming for you. 
 LISA (CONT'D) On the phone -- what you said.  It's impossible. 
 I'm going to kill Ed Witwer. 
 It's not true. 
 LISA (CONT'D) You're upset.  You've been unhappy. There's a lot of pressure on you. And then Frank ... 
 One week from today.  Tuesday, June 25, at five-twenty in the morning. I shoot him, Lisa. 
 (beat) You need to take time off. 
 You don't have to worry about that. 
 (gently) I want to hold you. 
 If you love me, stand there.  And don't move. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) I saw the disc, Lisa.  I shoot him. In the chest.  And he dies.  I've watched a thousand murders.  This time I star in one. 
 Something's wrong.  You wouldn't do it. 
 The Precogs are never wrong.  They emit a single disc.  "The immutable evidence of the infallible system." 
 We'll figure this out.  We'll review the system. 
 There is no review.  There's only the disc.  It Shows My guilt.  There's no defense. 
 You can't run.  Please, let's -- 
 Last week.  It was strange.  I watched from the bathroom window.  You went out in the backyard to make a call. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) An appointment, you said.  For a haircut that afternoon. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) You didn't get your hair cut.  You went to the trouble of calling first thing in the morning.  It was that important ... 
 Stop it!  Paul, please.  You're panicking.  Everything's going to look wrong.  You're going to distrust everybody and everything now. 
 LISA (CONT'D) You can't distrust me. (beat) It was Ed I called. 
 Ed.  why outside?  Why lie about it? 
 Stop being a cop and listen to me! 
 (O.S.) Director Anderson!  There is no escape! 
 Your birthday's tomorrow!  We wanted to... 
 (O.S.) Drop to your hands and knees and stay there.  Precrime is entering your house! 
 Paul! 
 
 1 He's got a hair dryer going.  Screwed up my reading. 
 2 We're not picking up shit. 
 Paul Anderson 0256 clear. 
 Enter now please, Assistant Director Witwer. 
 The central question is: Why does Anderson want to kill Witwer? 
 Personnel checks reveal no ambitious coups planned by you to topple him. (beat) He's done nothing to you, or you to him. 
 No. 
 HIS MOTHER?  HIS BROTHER? 
 So, you are friends, partners, and soul mates.  Anderson has no motive. 
 I can't think of one. (beat) Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs are mistaken? 
 You don't believe that, do you? 
 (barely audible) No.  The Precogs are infallible. 
 You're goddam right.  So, gentlemen -screw the motive.  We got a pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty little PR problem. 
 Now look-- 
 The public must believe that every future murderer is pursued with equal vigor. 
 Therefore, Precrime will put in charge the man best suited to the job.  And who would pursue a murderer harder ... than his intended victim? 
 You went after Anderson yesterday -because it was right, and because you believe. 
 Haw long will it take, Director? 
 He knows Precrime, of course.  And the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll remember how to work them.  It'll come back to him fast.  He's ... the best. 
 We're not here to praise Caesar -- we're here to bury him. 
 He can't avoid iris identification. Every door he opens, every ATM he uses, or taxi or transport he boards -- he'll get scanned. (quietly) It won't take long to find him. 
 Paul! 
 Why am I going to kill you,Ed? 
 There's no motive 
 My wife calling you before breakfast? 
 We were planning a surprise party. It was going to be today. (beat, ironic) Happy birthday, partner. 
 This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell of a surprise, though. (beat) I'm having trouble trusting people, Ed, I gotta tell you. 
 The train makes two stops, here and here: 20th, then 33rd Street. 
 (to the officer) Split the units, go to both 
 We'll never make 20th 
 You there, Ed? 
 I'm here.  You gotta come in, Paul . 
 I'm a Cop, Ed. I need a motive. 
 Come in.  We'll figure this thing out together. 
 It'll get ugly if you keep running. And your eyes, Paul -- every move you make a Scanner will pinpoint you for us. 
 I saw a news flash.  You're the new Director.  Is that the point of this? 
 Fuck you. 
 Didn't think so.  But it has to be something, Ed. 
 Paul.  Come in. 
 If I come in, it puts me close to you.  If I get close ... I may kill you.  I can't risk that. (beat) Anyway, they'd force you to lock me up.  And that'd be it -- I'd never get my chance to solve this thing. 
 You're kinds liking this, in a way, aren't you?  The action ... 
 And you get to be a real cop again. We get to flex our muscles. 
 ANDERSON'S VOICE I want to tell you something, partner. You listening? 
 Yeah. 
 ANDERSON'S VOICE I gotta do this.  I have to figure this thing out. (beat) But listen to me now.  If it was you running, I'd come after you, Ed. 
 You wouldn't shoot a cop would you, Paul? (beat) Paul?  Paul? 
 Got a cold. 
 DOC (CONT'D) Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there, and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum antibios I'll be shooting into you. 
 I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) It's all I could safely move 
 Yeah.  All right. 
 DOC (CONT'D) You understand what I told you then. I can't just give you new irises. The Scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off. 
 I'm a cop, I know 
 I gotta take your eyes out. 
 DOC (CONT'D) And put in new ones. 
 Yeah.  I get it, DOC. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Do me quick before I run out of here. 
 DOC'S VOICE Don't take the bandages off for twenty four hours.  You'll go blind if you do. 
 You're in a room.  I had you moved here, a couple miles from my place. If they find you, they don't find me. 
 DOC (CONT'D) A guy will come in, feed you once. (beat) I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes, 'cause I know you're in a hurry. 
 (Fuzzily)) Nano-re ...construction. 
 Organic microrobots that reconstruct nerves and blood vessels.  It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  Don't scratch. 
 DOC (CONT'D) I'm giving you a bonus, might come in handy.  Feel this. 
 DOC (CONT'D) It's a temporary paralytic enzyme. Someone spots you, you duck into an alley, shoot this under your chin. 
 DOC (CONT'D) The enzyme turns your facial muscles to mush.  You won't look like the same man. 
 Jesus. 
 You tighten up again in about thirty minutes.  Hurts like nothing you ever felt.  It's vicious, but effective.  I'll put it in your bag. 
 DOC (CONT'D) I'm setting up a timer.  When it buzzes tomorrow, take off your bandages, and get the hell out of here. 
 I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach. (MORE) 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Guess I should eat. (Beat) You gonna help feed me? 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) So how do we do this, pal? 
 (to himself) Fuck. 
 1 Got 27 warm bodies in this place. What should it take, three or four Spiders? 
 2 Do four.  Speed things up, so we can go eat. 
 It's nice to have a little company 
 1 Stinking drunk. 
 2 (beat) Or a guy who doesn't want to get read. 
 1 Let's eat. 
 They told me to move into Paul's office.  I said fuck you very much. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) (softly) I don't want to do any of this, Lisa. 
 I know.  I know that. (MORE) 
 LISA (CONT'D) (beat) Everybody's got their reasons for wanting you in charge.  So do I -- you won't bring him in dead. 
 Yeah.  But if he shoots a cop ... (beat) Which is what he does four days from now, isn't it? 
 He'd never hurt you. 
 I know that.  But the other thing I know is -- the Precogs are never wrong. 
 Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington.  Plenty of seats in the back. 
 Time to upgrade your alarm system, Senator. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Your work-up of Witwer.  The Security Panel would've done one. (beat) Why do I kill Witwer? 
 There's no motive. 
 There's, always a motive. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) I could've come to anyone on the panel.  But I picked you. (beat) Of all the shits on that panel, I like you least of all.  So if this gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but not, you know, devastated. 
 What the fuck was I worried about? You can't kill me.  The Precogs would've seen it. 
 Tell you something about the Precogs, Senator.  They're great on murder. But it's the little things they fail to see. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Little things like that, for instance. 
 He hasn't shown up on one goddamn IdentiScan in three days. 
 He's found a room -- he's going to sit it out. 
 Yeah, except for holding a gun to senator Malcolm's goddman head in his own goddman house last night, Anderson's sitting it out! (beat) Why hasn't he been scanned? 
 WITWER (CONT'D) Why is he invisible?  He's moving around but he isn't being seen. 
 He’s beating the scanners 
 No one beats the scanners. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) He's done his eyes 
 But the scarring always 
 He went the whole way.  The crazy bastard had his eyes removed.  New ones sewn in. 
 That takes weeks to heal. 
 If you're prepared to go blind, a street surgeon'll juice up the repair cycle.  They don't give a fuck about risk. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) He's going to do what it takes to stay free -- if it blinds him, maims him, or kills him. 
 
 
 The United States Supreme Court has issued a special injunction allowing the unprecedented public viewing of former Precrime Director Paul Anderson's future murder of Edward Witwer, the current Director. 
 His mouth slowly opens.  He steps back against a wall and slides his hand into his pants pocket.  He looks at the Precog DISC in his cupped hand, then quickly puts it away. 
 She continues her declamation 
 SPOKESWOMAN (CONT'D) The video you are about to see, generated by the Precognitive mutants, is the immutable evidence of the infallible system. (reassuring smile) Citizens are urged to call 1-800-PRECRIME with any information that may lead us to the whereabouts of Paul Anderson, future murderer. 
 Shakes his head in confusion and disbelief.  But he has the Precog disc ... 
 This oughtta be good, huh? 
 
 
 Oh, Ed ... 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Moves quickly through the crowds. 
 "Ennis Page engages the services of prostitutes because his relationships with them compound his feelings of selfloathing." (beat) Direct quote from your psychological profile -- the kind of shit I had to know as your former boss. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) "Page is an obsessive-compulsive Type Nine." Another quote.  Niners are great for the kind of work you do -- keeping all those Precog discs in order. 
 I fuck whores and I'm orderly, so what? 
 Something's out of order, Ennis. Deeply out of order. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Not A disc.  The disc.  When I went home sick, I stole it. (MORE) 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) I took it with me, Ennis.  I wasn't sick, I was running with the evidence. (lets that sink in) So how is it that Precrime has one, too? 
 (utterly baffled) You can't make copies 
 PAGE (CONT'D) It's the basis of the system.  The immutable evidence.  Copies are impossible. (beat) You went home.  A little later, I came in with a disc for Mr. Witwer to review.  I wasn't halfway out the door when he cried out. 
 PAGE (CONT'D) He was in shock.  He showed me.  It was you shooting him.  Then all hell broke loose.  He had to send the Precrime units to your house. 
 Ennis -- you gave out the same disc twice.  Less than an hour apart. The one I stole.  And then another one.  Of the same event. 
 It's impossible.  The Precogs can only move forward to new events. Into the future.  They never repeat. 
 Have a nice night, Mr. Symington 
 Hey!  Hey, you can't... 
 It's me. 
 Paul. 
 Your phone will be bugged.  So we can't meet, we can't do anything. Just listen.  Nowing you're listening is enough. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) When Precrime stormed the house, I thought you'd called them.  Betrayed me. 
 No. 
 I know.  Witwer sent them.  He saw the disc and had to do his job. (beat) Tell me you forgive me.  Please. 
 Of course, I forgive you. 
 All these people I need to forgive me. (beat) Do you think Frank forgave me?  All I could do for him was send him gardenias. (long beat) I love you. 
 (whispers to herself) Frank hated gardenias. 
 Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands and knees! 
 What the hell -- 
 Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands and knees! 
 VOICE (CONT'D) Lower your weapon, or we will neutralize your threat potential. 
 VOICE (CONT'D) Do not move! 
 Pick one for me! 
 What? 
 Point to the train I should take. Please. 
 I don't know. 
 Don't kill me!  Jesus.  Please. 
 But the Precogs would've predicted me killing you.  You'd know whether I do or not. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) They shut down the system.  Haven't they?  They've shut down the Precogs. 
 They're off homicides.  They're redirecting them to help us locate you. 
 
 ANDERSON'S FACE 
 You all right in there? 
 Welcome to the main headquarters of Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United States. 
 What is it? 
 What? 
 TECHNICIAN (CONT'D) It's him -- he's been scanned. 
 Where is he? 
 (barely audible) He had to have. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Standing orders from the Security Panel, sir. 
 If he wants to get to me, he'll get to me. 
 No, he won't, sir. 
 Explanation, please! 
 Shit. 
 Save us, Anderson. 
 I have to get out of here. 
 Save us. 
 You let me get here, didn't you? You stopped giving them information, so they couldn't track me. 
 Save -- And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls? What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom. 
 (wearily, to herself) Help me, Paul. 
 LISA (CONT'D) They're blue. 
 LISA (CONT'D) And now they're brown. 
 Why didn't the Precogs know he was coming to do this? 
 WITWER (CONT'D) The next time he shows up it'll be to kill me. 
 We won't let that happen, sir. 
 You won't, huh? 
 WITWER (CONT'D) (to a technician) When can we get these things operational? 
 These two are all I have to find the man who is about to murder me.  Hook them up, and flood them with whatever kind of fucking chemicals you have to.  They are a machine, and I need that machine at my disposal. 
 Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis.  I could just walk in here. 
 I forgot.  To turn it on. 
 You don't look surprised to see me. 
 LISA (CONT'D) I need your help. 
 He took one of my babies. 
 He's desperate, Ennis.  He had to. (beat) We have to help him. 
 LISA (CONT'D) It's a fake Ennis. 
 LISA (CONT'D) This is the first disc.  You delivered it to Director Anderson.  He reviewed it.  And then he stole it, and went on the run. 
 I delivered ... a fake .. to him? 
 But he thought it was real, and ran with it. 
 LISA (CONT'D) An hour later, you delivered a second disc of the same event.  Witwer reviewed it.  It was real.  (Beat) How do I know this? 
 LISA (CONT'D) Director Anderson had his eyes changed.  They were blue.  Now he has brown ones. 
 LISA (CONT'D) This disc, the fake one, shows a blueeyed Anderson murdering Witwer two days from now.  He doesn't have blue eyes anymore.  The person who faked this disc had no idea he would change his eyes. 
 LISA (CONT'D) Listen!  But the second disc has to be real, because he has brown eyes when he murders Witwer. (MORE) 
 LISA (CONT'D) (beat) Somebody tried to frame him with a fake.  And somehow it all became real. Why, Ennis?  How could this happen? 
 LISA (CONT'D) You handle the discs.  How did a fake one get delivered? 
 LISA (CONT'D) You want-- ? 
 He spilled coffee everywhere ... Everywhere ... 
 What coffee?  What are you -- ? 
 My brothers aren't here. 
 You didn't even look around.  You knew. 
 (beat) We can sense each other.  You must save 
 Stop.  I saved You.  It was the best I could do. 
 Thank you, Anderson. 
 What am I going to do with you? 
 Name me, Anderson. 
 What? 
 Give me a name.  I've never had one. 
 Listen. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Listen to me. (beat) Listen to me ... Rose. 
 Rose. 
 Rose.  They shifted your precognition so you would locate me. 
 (guiltily) I didn't know. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) When they shifted you to find me, you didn't reveal everything.  That I was going to break into Precrime. 
 You used me -- to save you. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) No one cared that we were human. From a human mother.  Taken at birth. Hooked to machines. (beat) We have been alive, Anderson. Enslaved, for the greater good. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) But now I have a name.  And I know the man who has named - me will not allow me to be enslaved again. 
 Rose.  What's going to happen to us? Can you see that? 
 You didn't know I was going to do that, did you? 
 Who else could it've been? 
 (beat) Page worshipped the system.  He fell apart.  Shot himself. 
 Anderson. 
 Director Witwer.  This event is a positive homicide. (MORE) 
 There. 
 The one on the left, the first disc -it's a fake.  He doesn't have blue eyes anymore. 
 A fake. 
 (BEAT) But the Precogs predict the infallible truth.  They don't emit fake discs. 
 Exactly.  You can't tamper with the Precogs, induce them to make fakes (MORE) 
 LISA (CONT'D) (beat) But that doesn't mean someone couldn't have made a fake disc on their own and inserted it into the delivery system. 
 Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake disc in with that day's real ones... 
 (excited) We're all programmed to believe anything we see on a Precog disc. The system has never been wrong ... 
 LISA (CONT'D) You have to call off the hunt.  He was set up. 
 (long beat) It's gone too far, Lisa She shakes her head, shocked at his response 
 He was set up!  You both were.  If Paul kills you, you're both out of the picture. 
 Who wants us out?  Of what picture? 
 Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing!  And then we can investigate Witwer's mouth opens and closes.  He tries again. 
 Ennis Page was murdered last night. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) Everything points to Paul. 
 He's not a murderer. 
 I think he is.  A murderer ... and a future murderer. (beat) Lisa.  What does it matter that the first disc is a fake ... if the second one's real? 
 Rose.  Listen to me.  I'm going to leave you here.  I have to keep moving. 
 It's impossible.  There's no time. I've done what I can do! 
 ROSE (CONT'D) Do you see that boy in the blue hat walking with his mother? (beat) In sixty seconds he will walk beneath those workers installing a window on the tenth floor of that building. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) They'll drop the window, killing him.  It is impossible to save him. 
 You knew it wasn't impossible.  That I'd get there. 
 I'm in a lot of trouble right now. 
 Rose.  Ed Witwer -he's in the most trouble of all.  Who saves him? 
 DR. RESFIELD We're not really set up for this type of 
 Rose.  Try to drink. 
 Why? 
 What are you seeing? 
 You're scaring me, Rose 
 ROSE (CONT'D) In three minutes your wife will take a walk .. 
 Sir?  I'm sorry, she stepped out for a few minutes. (beat) Sir? 
 Hello?  Hello? 
 ANDERSON'S VOICE I need you. 
 (V.O.) At 1:07 hang up the phone and enter the Lawrence Museum. 
 (V.O.) At 1:13 the two Precrime officers following you take a wrong turn into a different room, losing sight of you for ten seconds. 
 (V.O.) An undercover transport officer will have received emergency orders to follow you. (MORE) He's wearing a red tie.  He has short blond hair. 
 (V.O.) As you come around the bend, cry out and turn around and slap the officer... 
 (V.O.) Stay on Ninth street.  Underneath Ninth street is the main power feed for The Sprawl.  It'll mess up the navigational beacon on the hovercraft. (beat) Keep switching taxis.  But stay on Ninth. 
 Two hundred dollars if you don't scan me. 
 (V.O.) The hovercraft will try to drop altitude, but the air traffic will slow it down. (beat) Precrime loses you.  You'll have to walk two miles.  Don't get scanned. 
 You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your teeth out. 
 Cut it a little close there, honeybunch. 
 Rose got the street wrong.  She's getting weak. 
 Rose? 
 Two discs.  One fake.  One real. 
 I don't think there were supposed to be two.  Whoever planned it, wasn't counting on two. 
 An infallible system.  Every disc ever generated has been true ... 
 Somebody wants you out of the way -- so they make a fake disc.  Who ever doubts the discs? 
 I never doubted it.  I saw it.  And believed it, absolutely.  I was certain I was going to murder Witwer. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) I saw the fake, and believed so much in the system, that I saw myself as a murderer. (beats) And the Precogs picked up those thoughts ... 
 And generated the second disc.  The real one. 
 A self-fulfilling prophesy.  I believed it was true.  And that made it true. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Rose.  If all this is based on a lie -the fake disc -- then do I really kill Witwer? 
 We can't take chances, sir 
 The event. 
 I've been ordered to get you onto the craft.  By force if necessary. 
 The event is inevitable, Lieutenant. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) The Precogs are never wrong.  The event will take place.  I'm a believer.  Aren't you? 
 I don't leave this room without you, sir.  The Security Panel insists. 
 Nobody could slip a fake disc past Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head. 
 He was the weak link in the perfect system. 
 Obsessive compulsive niners can't allow changes in the routine 
 Something threw him off. (beat) He tried to tell me.  It didn't make any sense.  Something about "spilled coffee." (beat) Someone was in his office with him. And coffee spilled ... 
 ROSE (CONT'D) Even now.  You forget that I'm here. You talk between yourselves.  And when you need me to see into the future, then you turn to me. 
 Rose.  What is it? 
 Your eyes were open.  What did you see, Rose? 
 Rose.  Who spilled the coffee? Straight ahead ... 
 
 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Page was so upset at the sight of the coffee. 
 ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket, reached over Page and put it in one of the open cases. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) I didn't understand what I'd seen. And I had no one to tell ... 
 Ed ... 
 The perfect system -brought down by a cup of coffee.  My god. 
 (long beat) He set into motion his own death. He didn't know it would go this far. (to Rose) What makes me leave this room?  If I stay here I won't kill him.  Right? 
 You see, if you think you can put me on a hovercraft and save me, then you don't believe in the infallibility of the Precog system. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) And what I do not want around me, are nonbelievers. 
 Things quiet? 
 Sir.  Should you ... be here? 
 There's been a development.  A body's been found in the Sprawl. 
 Anderson's? 
 They're checking it out.  I need to see what the Precogs have seen. 
 Borrowed this from the technicians' lounge.  You don't think they'll mind, do you? 
 DR.RESFIELD You shouldn't be here, Director. 
 No, no.  This is exactly where I should be. 
 DR. RESFIELD You're under a lot of strain, Director. 
 And tv's so good for that -- soothes the mind. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) Bring me up to speed, Doc. 
 DR. RESFIELD We're getting nothing from them. 
 And that's because ... ? 
 DR. RESFIELD I don't know. 
 Do you think they know where Anderson is? 
 DR. RESFIELD It's impossible to tell. (beat) We've done everything.  Maybe even too much. 
 They know how to find Anderson for me. (MORE) 
 WITWER (CONT'D) (beat) They're the perfect machine, Doctor. You just have to know which button to push. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Come on, Rose. 
 One hour.  We hold it together for an hour, Witwer lives -- and I'm not a murderer. 
 She won't last an hour. 
 Rose! 
 ROSE (CONT'D) You didn't save my brother. 
 Did he kill both of them, Rose? Rose! 
 If you leave this room... 
 Then I'm a cop, just trying to do hisjob. 
 Is he coming?  No?  Yes?  Maybe? (beat) I think yes. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) And you think yes. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) Infallibly, immutably yes. 
 I figured, since I can see the future, too, maybe I could get a little disc action going. (beat) Just kidding. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) You find you been doing that a lot this week?  Looking at clocks? (beat) Three minutes to go. 
 There's never anything good on, you know? 
 There.  That's the old Paul. 
 You're not the old Ed. You've lost it. 
 You lost it.  You went weak in the knees, partner. 
 I'm not your partner. 
 The air went out of you when Frank D'Ignazio killed himself. 
 He was guilty.  I accepted that. 
 No you didn't.  The doubts were creeping in on you.  The lab trying to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm pressuring you to expand ... 
 WITWER (CONT'D) Belief is the basis of the system. It was your job to be the ultimate believer. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) And when Frank died, you faltered. I'm a cop, I see into the hearts of men. (beat) And the thing about you is, you wouldn't have just walked away. 
 Never been my style. 
 Precrime needs to grow.  You would have stood in its way.  The Security Panel wouldn't have understood that. What you're capable of.  What a bulldog you are. (beat) Look what you've been doing to us all week.  Amazing.  You're the best. 
 So you took matters into your own hands. 
 I understood the threat.  I understood YOU 
 You killed a Precog.  You ended the system you wanted to protect. 
 Wrong.  This lab will make more. Believe it, Paul. 
 Knowing the exact moment of your death -it's made you crazy, Ed. 
 You sonofabitch! 
 WITWER (CONT'D) You didn't bring your gun! 
 That's right.  No gun. 
 You see?!  That's exactly what I'm talking about.  You don't Believe! 
 WITWER (CONT'D) The system is infallible. 
 WITWER (CONT'D) I guess that's why I've always carried two. 
 You can't have it both ways.  You don't want to die.  That's why you lured me here -- to kill me first. (MORE) 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) (beat) But it you don't diet the system is flawed, and you couldn't live with that. 
 Pick it up 
 WITWER (CONT'D) You're killing him, partner. 
 Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains his gun on Anderson.  Anderson trains his gun on Witwer. 
 ANDERSON (CONT'D) Oh, Ed ... 
 Now do you believe?

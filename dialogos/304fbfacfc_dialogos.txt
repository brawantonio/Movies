 
 Cut. Brilliant. 
 Okay, I think we have a little communication gap here. Natasha translates in Russian what Andy just said. 
 When I said «more»... 
 ...I didn't mean trash the fucking set. 
 This is not Chekhov. You're not the star. You're just another victim. 
 You get stabbed. You die. 
 I want to see the pain. 
 I want to see the blood spurting. 
 You make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with your elbow. Okay ? 
 We're gonna be here till Christmas, right ? (turning around and calling) Natasha ! 
 Yes. 
 Tell him you make the blood flow by squeezing the bag with your elbow. 
 Okay. 
 Mmmm... She heard you. You all keep forgetting she can hear you perfectly well. 
 Okay, from the top. 
 What's the holdup ? The angry bearded man speaks angrily in Russian. 
 What is he saying ? 
 Okay, well, let's just do the close-up of the corpse now, and that'll wrap it for today. 
 All right. Okay. So, what I want to do is zoom in, do a slow zoom into the puddle of blood... On another part of the set, behind the dining room, Billy kneels down in front of a big ancient-looking wooden trunk. 
 Billy. 
 Madame Olga wants some sugar in her blood again. Billy laughs. 
 So, he's kind of cute. 
 Three months in Moscow, cold winter nights... 
 Just a thought. 
 Billy, that's what Mom would say. 
 Hi. 
 He says use more white like a real dead body. 
 What... what is going on now ? 
 Andy. Sorry, it's six o'clock. 
 One shot, one more shot ! 
 We have no time. 
 One shot ! I can't believe this. 
 She needs to go get Strohbecker's face. 
 Ohh ! Right ! His dummy falls off the balcony on Monday. 
 We'll wait for you here. 
 Karen, she's got her own car. 
 Okay. Okay. Don't forget tonight. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah! Fiesta ! I'm making my famous chili con Clarke. Near Andy's car, Alex, the assistant producer we just saw on the set, is opening the door of his car. 
 Alex !... what do you say ? You coming ? 
 Sorry. I have tickets for the Bolshoi Ballet tonight. 
 Well, try and stay awake. 
 Yeah ! 
 Damn ! 
 Honey ! Honey, can you get that ? 
 Honey ! 
 Hello ?... Hello ? 
 Hello ? 
 It could've been Billy. 
 I'm still thinking about dinner. 
 She's not there either. Shit. 
 Okay. Ohh ! 
 Hello, Billy ! 
 Thank God. She's there. Are you all right ? 
 Ask her about the mask. 
 You want to tap something through ? CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT 
 Wait. Wait. Wait. 
 Oh, man ! 
 Oh, man ! 
 ...L ? 
 Man ! Oh, man ! 
 Was it L ? The second letter, was it L ? Karen shushes Andy with her hand. 
 Shit ! 
 A-L-L ? 
 O...kay ! 
 We're eating out tonight. 
 Okay. So are you coming over now ? 
 Well, don't worry. Just get over here. 
 You hungry ? 
 Bye. 
 Hey ! 
 Hello ? 
 Is anyone there ? 
 I can explain. 
 Lyosha ! Lyosha is coming to meet Arkadi. They speak in Russian. 
 Arkadi ! 
 Arkadi ! 
 Billy ! 
 Wait. I explain. 
 Lyosha ! In the electricians' control cabin, hearing his name, Lyosha looks outside the cabin. 
 Come here, quickly ! 
 Oh, my God, Billy. 
 Quickly ! 
 What did happen ? 
 I don't know. 
 She slipped and fall bad. Poor Billy. 
 Andy, she's at the back ! 
 Get the doctor, quickly. 
 You go. I'll stay here with her. 
 Let go of her. 
 No, I must hold her. She must not move. 
 Danger she'll never walk again if she move. 
 Go ! 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Billy !... Billy, you mustn't move... You may become paralyzed. It's dangerous... Don't worry. I'll be right back... I promise. 
 Andy ! 
 What's going on ? 
 Andy, go with the janitor... 
 What ? 
 Do it now ! 
 Ambulance ! 
 Come on ! 
 It's all right, sweetie. 
 I'm here now and an ambulance is on its way. 
 Let go of her. She's trying to say something. 
 Police ? 
 Murder ? 
 Andy ! Andy ! CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT 
 Excuse me. It's true. We just fake murder. If we really want to murder... 
 We're not stupid, really. The janitor is trying to follow the conversation. We hear a policeman talking in Russian. 
 No, no. Sorry. 
 ...a real murder and panic. Billy taps on Karen's arm. Karen looks up at Arkadi. 
 Where did you see the murder from ? 
 And it was this man ? 
 But you say here : «He wore a stocking pulled over his head.» 
 «And then they chased me through the building and try to kill me as well.» 
 Guys ! Guys ! English, please. 
 We make test for you. 
 For your film. We try make blood much big. 
 We not tell you. Keep secret not to hurt your feelings. 
 I would've let you done tests. 
 What I mean is... What I mean is... Let's see their film. I'll know if it's real. 
 Wait. Stop ! Karen runs after Lyosha. 
 He could expose the film. 
 Let her do it. Please. 
 Okay. 
 This lets you unload the film without needing a darkroom. 
 I see. Close shot on Arkadi's face. He looks very menacing. 
 It's okay... It's okay. 
 Murder weapon ? Where ? 
 I'm... 
 What ? 
 I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 You... 
 Oh, my God! 
 Tastes sweet. 
 It's for the actors. They put the stuff in their mouths. 
 What she say ? 
 That it's her knife. They broke into her box and used all the blood. 
 So now she say it was a trick. 
 It happened so fast she couldn't see the knife clearly. 
 But everything else she saw tonight was clear ? Huh ? 
 The body in the elevator shaft. She saw that. 
 What ? 
 What ? What ? 
 Sweet. It is fake blood. 
 It's fake blood. 
 They could have soaked the sheets in fake blood afterwards. 
 But... where is the body ? Huh ? 
 Here you say, "A head cut off." 
 Oh ! Wait. Wait. Ah ! She says... Well, there were more bags in there before. 
 No, she's right. I will show you. 
 From lift shaft we take the rubbish here. Fast. Easy. 
 Hey, we need that. 
 Sorry, I can do nothing for you now. But I will call you after I see the film. Okay ? Sorry. He walks away. The second policeman shakes hands with Arkadi and Lyosha and goes away with his chief. 
 Well, I've never been more embarrassed in my entire life. 
 I don't get it. I mean, Billy's a pro. She'd know the difference between a real murder and a gag. 
 Please, has she even seen a real murder ? 
 That's my point. If what she saw tonight was real, then she has seen the difference, right ? 
 Oh, come on, honey. We all bought the guy cutting me up tonight. Even I believed it. 
 Because you're a wuss. 
 I'm gonna let that slide. 
 No offense, Billy, but I'd like to re-shoot the stuff today using that guy's knife. 
 It was her knife. God ! 
 Whatever. It looked good. 
 Shut up. 
 Buka ! 
 Buka ? 
 Buka. 
 Buka. Buka. 
 Please, Billy, take some of mine. You'll feel better. 
 Okay. 
 Could you pass me the salt, please ? 
 You could at least make the effort. Andy stops eating, looks at Billy drinking water and then at Karen. 
 Listen... I'm sorry. All I can think about now is the movie, but as soon as we get back, I promise, I'll learn. 
 How often have I heard that ? 
 Come on. I can understand some of what she's saying. 
 What ? 
 Okay, how about this ? 
 Means «makeup», right ? 
 Wrong. It means somebody's look, the expression on their face. 
 That was close. 
 What Billy said she'll never forget the look on the girl's face tonight from the moment she knew she was gonna die. She said the pain and the terror was real. You can't act that. 
 About the money... 
 Yes, of course. No problem. 
 We did our job. The condition was... 
 Yes. Yes, and we have your diskette. 
 American girl say something, but nobody believe her. 
 You mean ?... THE REAPER I think we understand each other, Mr. Hausmann. 
 No, honestly, you can come back to our place, and we'll set up the couch if you want. 
 You're not on one of your «I'll show her how independent I am» kicks, are you ? 
 Honey, you coming or what ? 
 Andy, don't you care about her ? 
 I don't care ? I don't care ? Fine, fine. I'm calling the American Embassy tonight, okay ? 
 It's the weekend. They're closed. 
 Not for us. My dad gave me the duty officer's direct number before we left, just in case. So say goodbye. He waves to Billy, who waves back to him. She blows a kiss to her sister, who blows one back, and enters her building. 
 Mr. Lovett, these are the two officers who answered the complaint. He shakes hands with the two policemen. 
 Good evening, gentlemen. 
 Good evening. 
 Please speak English to the ambassador's secretary. My chief asked me to meet Mr. Lovett here. If this witness is correct about what she saw tonight, she may help my own investigation. 
 Your English is quite good, Mr. Larsen. 
 Thank you. My mother was a translator. 
 In the university ? 
 No. KGB. 
 Please. They all follow the technician. 
 We've been tracking gangsters in Moscow running an international pornography and prostitution racket. 
 Sit down, please. We have information they have made snuff films here and sold them all over the world. 
 Snuff film... Is that what I think it is ? 
 Victims believe they are making a sex film, but they are murdered in front of the camera. 
 What is the name of the witness ? What is it ? 
 Billy Hughes, sir. 
 Billy Hughes. Yes. She claims to have seen one being made. 
 He is brutal, ruthless. They call him The Reaper. 
 I'm surprised his men gave up the film so easily. If it is what I think it is, our witness, Billy Hughes, is in great danger. 
 Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking. 
 Hello. 
 Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking. 
 Hello. 
 Have you seen a... how do you say... snuff film before ? 
 I saw a woman tied to a tree   kept alive while her arms and legs were cut off. It's hard   to talk about it, or even think about it. And it makes   you sick to watch it. You never forget the look in the   victim's eyes. The sheer panic and horror when they realize   they're about to die. 
 Right... Right... Right, sir. Right, sir. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. So, I really appreciate the call. I'll give Dad your best. Right. 
 Well ? 
 I told you. There's nothing to worry about. He says the film's the biggest piece of shit he's ever seen. 
 Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking. 
 Hi, Billy. It's Karen. I hope you weren't sleeping. I just wanted to check and see if you're okay. 
 I am fine. No need to worry. Did you call earlier ? 
 No, I got straight through. You sure you're okay ? 
 Sure. Had bath. All fine. Now I go to bed. You too. 
 I just wanted to tell you : they saw the film, and it's not the real thing. 
 Did I hear something there ? 
 Doorbell. Wait. I'll see who. 
 Billy ? You be careful, now. Check who it is first. 
 
 Please. I want to talk. 
 Billy, are you still there ? 
 Would you leave her alone ? 
 I heard a noise, Andy. Something's happened. I swear. 
 Billy ! 
 Okay, that's it. I'm going there. 
 What ? 
 Karen, help. Call police. Emergency. 
 Police, emergency. 
 Yes. 
 Da. 
 Hello, my name is Billy Hughes. My address is apartment 923... 
 ... 126 Kievsky prospekt... 
 Telephone 9-2-0-9-5-9-1-0... BILLY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT 
 Billy Hughes speaking. 
 This is a digital voice computer. 
 Please have patience and I will answer. 
 Hello ? You English ? 
 My name is Billy Hughes. 
 Yes ? What do you want, please ? 
 Hello ? 
 Help. Intruder. 
 I no understand. Sorry. 
 Bad man want to kill me. 
 Bad man ? I get man who speak English, yes ? Close up on the lock : another screw pops off. 
 I speak English. 
 Where's the diskette ? 
 Where is the diskette ? 
 I know you have ! 
 My name is Alexander Larsen. I'm a policeman. Take your clothes. We must get out of here. 
 You must hurry. 
 I explain everything in the car. 
 In the car. No time now. 
 They are coming. 
 We are in great danger. 
 Quick. 
 It's not over yet. Billy puts her jacket on. Larsen looks in the back-view mirror. 
 My... 
 Oh, my God, it's trashed ! 
 Billy, where are you ? 
 I'll call the police ! 
 Billy ! Oh, Billy. Oh, my God ! BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
 How do you work this thing ? Oh, there it is. 
 Someone's dead in the ba... 
 God ! Oh, my God ! 
 The girl you saw murdered tonight... 
 ...her boyfriend stole a diskette full of information. Money, names, connections, everything. He blackmailed The Reaper. Very dangerous. And now he thinks that you have the diskette. 
 You have it ?... Huh ? 
 We don't have any diskettes. 
 Not that one. That's my script. 
 The girl had it when she went into the studio. Then she was murdered, and it was gone. Where is it ? Think. You were the only person there. 
 Think. 
 Write. Write it. 
 Write it. 
 Quick, write. 
 Police ? Yes. Yes, but only with the diskette. 
 You know, I work undercover. The Reaper thinks I work for him. Trust me. Trust me. 
 Crazy ! 
 They'll kill you ! 
 Get in ! 
 Get in! 
 Please, give me the keys. 
 Write. Where is the diskette ? 
 We cannot escape in this car. Write. Write. 
 Studio. Where in the studio ? Billy makes a «No» with her finger. 
 Delta three. 
 What ? 
 What ? 
 This is all a big misunderstanding and... Excuse me, but this is... 
 You don't have to arrest us. Why is he arresting me ? This is ridiculous. I'm an American citizen. Do you understand what I'm saying ? Now, I'm a director. 
 You know, I'm directing a movie here in Moscow. I'm bringing a lot of money in this place. 
 And my father, okay, he knows a lot of big people, and... Listen. 
 You want money ? Is that what you want ? 
 I don't understand what is going on here. We don't have a diskette ! 
 # 1 You have one more chance to tell me where is diskette. 
 The diskette. You know, I mean, this is ridiculous. We don't have a diskette. That's what I'm saying. 
 Karen, get the key ! Get the key ! Unlock me ! 
 Right. Let's get out of here. 
 Answer it. 
 Why ? 
 They may say something about Billy. WARTSCHUK (voice over from the talkie) Delta three. 
 Da. 
 Da. 
 I got something about studio. Come on. 
 Look out ! 
 Mmm... It's not what you think. What do you say ?... How do you ?... In Russian, what ?... 
 What ? What does that mean ? 
 Hel... 
 Hello ? We need help ! 
 I'm a director, and I'm making a movie here. This is not a movie. 
 Put the gun away. You look like a hit man. He thinks we're gonna kill him ! 
 We're not gonna kill you ! 
 This is not even ours ! 
 The policemen wanted to kill us ! 
 We gotta get out of here. 
 Well, I think we should call the cops. 
 Are you crazy ? 
 Well, we can explain this. 
 Explain ? You are crazy. Come on. Here. 
 I'll take these too. 
 And now ? Billy tries to get out of the car, but she can't open the back door. 
 Child locks. 
 Don't look now, but our friends are still here. 
 I will block the other entrances. 
 What... what are you doing ? That... that's Red Square. 
 Oh, perfect. MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
 This damn gun, I can't work the safety. 
 Holy shit ! 
 Around the back. 
 Okay. Jump, Andy. I got you. 
 What ? 
 I got you. I got you. 
 It's no use. All lines are cut. 
 Where is it ? 
 You helped us a lot, Billy. Thank you. 
 The Reaper wants to meet the woman who has kept him up all night and witnessed a live snuff. 
 He wants you to do it. 
 You know why we call him The Reaper ? You see his face, you die. 
 Nice night, isn't it ? 
 I'm just taking a piss. Right, you know, just... The watcher walks slowly down the ladder. Karen reaches the ladder, climbs on something we don't see, and catches the watcher's foot through the steps of the ladder. The man falls and rolls all the way down the ladder. He is unconscious and Andy ties his wrist to the ladder with the handcuff. Karen joins him. Andy seems very happy about the successful operation. 
 Who the hell is that ? 
 Well, whoever it is, they're coming here. 
 I can't work the safety. 
 Andy, come on. 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. 
 Hurry ! 
 Shoot him. Shoot him, Andy. 
 Okay. 
 Be careful of Billy ! God. 
 Stay where you are ! 
 Stand back ! 
 Now please, let me explain. Please ? 
 Karen ! 
 Kill him. 
 You genius ! 
 You thought we were tourists, huh ? Guess again, pal. 
 Don't move. Don't move! I'm talking to you ! 
 I'm warning you. Don't move or I'm gonna shoot you ! Okay ! 
 Billy ! Billy ! Billy ! 
 She's okay. She's fine. 
 She's fine ? She's okay ? Billy mouth the words «I'm fine» and shows him the special effect device on her stomach. Larsen comes behind her and takes her by the shoulder, saying a few words in Russian. Billy says something in sign language to Karen. 
 A cop ? 
 A cop ? 
 Oh, my God, I'm sorry. 
 Sorry. 
 Forget it. Your sister was brilliant. 
 Next time, hit back. 
 Oh !... this is the remote. I get it. 
 Big cowboy. 
 What ? 
 That was an invitation to dinner sometime. 
 How you say ?... It would be a pleasure. 
 I still don't understand. 
 What ? 
 I don't understand why The Reaper didn't take the diskette off me. 
 Who ? 
 Whoops !... Shit. I'm sorry. 
 Big cowboy. 
 Ciao !... 
 Billy, tomorrow ! 
 Tomorrow ! 
 What's the matter ? 
 Big cowboy. 
 Guys, could we get out of here, please ? 
 The expression ? 
 The car ? 
 The car...

 
 Know what the problem is, kid?   You're too ugly to get propositioned. 
 C'mon, it's a quiet night. 
 Next week we work the park. 
 You will, one day at a time.   I'll be old and grey when it happens... 
 A small gift, sir, for the Queen ... 
 Here you go, your Highness. 
 Thank you, officer. 
 Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful. 
 How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping. 
 One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family. 
 Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery? 
 I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it. 
 What was it this time? 
 We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up. 
 You okay? 
 Freeze!   Police! 
 Let her go. 
 You have no idea how sorry you're going to be. (to The Girl) Don't worry. 
 Mike... 
 Take your time... one day at a time, kid... 
 (grinning) Ain't that a shit-- 
 Hey, Reilly, Captain's looking for you. 
 Prints? 
 Nothing so far. 
 What about the ballistics report? 
 Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it. 
 Reilly, what the hell happened out there?   Why didn't you call for back-up? 
 You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved. 
 You know the rules. You're off the street `til I.A.D. clears the investigation. Now go home and clean yourself up, get some rest... 
 She won't talk. Look at this shit, no I.D., nothing... 
 What's that? 
 Bracelet she was wearing. 
 Maybe she knows your old man. 
 Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie- 
 Okay, kid.    Run this down to the Cave. 
 May I help you? 
 They're not here. 
 And you are...? 
 There out on a call, perhaps I can help you- 
 2600 block of Lakefront.   A limousine.   But, I- 
 Smell anything, Schnoz?    Me, neither. 
 Who the heck're you? 
 We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive. 
 Schnoz says it's loaded.    Good boy, Schnozzie. 
 Alright boys, look close.   Let's assess. 
 Whadaya think, "boy" or "girl"? 
 It's a "girl" ! 
 No shit.   I better send Meg flowers just in case. 
 He is! 
 Where did you get this? 
 High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition. 
 Fire in the hole! 
 Sorry about that. (to Reilly) That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do. 
 Hey wait a minute- 
 That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on. 
 What about the cop? 
 If you'd let me waste him. 
 She won't. 
 I say we split town. Come back to this job when things cool. We've got other contracts - Denver, Seattle... 
 I want her back and we do the job. 
 I thought we agreed, the personal can't interfere with the professional. 
 Unless we make them. 
 Captain, line one! 
 (to Reilly) I thought I told you-- 
 He says it's important, something about the Rice shooting. 
 Winters. 
 SWAN'S VOICE I said release the girl or alot of people are going to die. 
 Wait, what do you mean--? 
 What the hell was that? 
 What? 
 It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap. 
 We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert. 
 Goddamit, Reilly-- 
 I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand? 
 No, honey, I'm fine. Yeah, well, you're welcome. You deserve flowers more often. 
 Bev, you're the greatest... 
 Hey, that's the guy- 
 Alright, let's check it out. 
 Assist?   What the hell you know about tickers anyway? 
 Easy, guys. (to Reilly) (MORE) 
 When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department. 
 (to Glass) What do you think? 
 Call upstairs, see what you can find out. 
 Right. 
 (re: bracelet) T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk. 
 What time is it? 
 Swan, it's no use. Look, we can still make Houston-- 
 Shut up! 
 Fuck off, pal. 
 Eight dead, so far. 
 What're you doing here? 
 And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Son-of-a-bitch... my nose...   This fuck-up is interfering with- 
 Reilly, what're you doing here? 
 I thought I told you-- 
 (O.C.) He's with us. 
 Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner. (to Reilly) Coming? 
 Go ahead, kid. 
 I'm filing charges against that mother- 
 Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose. 
 That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner. 
 Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives. 
 This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand? 
 Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive. 
 By the way, I'm Glass.   This is T.J., and Pooch. 
 That there's Schnoz, mascot and ace bomb sniffer. Say hi, Schnozzie. 
 Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ... 
 We don't use the b-word.      Bad luck. 
 Treat.    We treat devices. 
 Don't push it, slick. 
 I don't know... 
 Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you. 
 C4, plastic explosive. 
 Hey, check this out? 
 Lemme see that. 
 Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something. 
 Let's go, we gotta jump on him the second he calls again. 
 You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you. 
 Captain, it's him! 
 Winters here. 
 SWAN'S VOICE Don't make me send another. 
 Look, we're prepared to talk, what do you want--? 
 Upstairs, interrogation. 
 Three hours. She's tough. 
 Tough? Tough is "Fuck you, where's my lawyer?". This chick doesn't say boo. 
 Bupkiss.    Sorry about Rice. 
 She ain't no hooker.   This is a murder investigation. 
 I'll be in the can. 
 We missed you, where'd you go? 
 Awright!   How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking? 
 I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register. 
 Whadaya mean? 
 It's from an IRA. 
 Oh shit... 
 I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish? 
 Only once, at Redstone. 
 Shit.   We're fucked. 
 Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal. 
 Stop it... 
 Shut up, T.J.! 
 Be nice Pooch! 
 Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar? 
 No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did. 
 (beat) Drive. 
 Then let's go see what they missed. 
 So what were they doing here? 
 An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout. 
 Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers. 
 (nods) Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs. 
 There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course. 
 With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver? 
 Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers. 
 No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage. 
 This is where the van was parked. 
 Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ... 
 Bingo! 
 Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ... 
 Ka-Boooom. 
 They make bowling balls out of vulcanized rubber ... 
 Resin... 
 (beat, proud of his team) A bowling alley. 
 Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work. 
 (smirks at Reilly) "Punks", huh? 
 Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area. 
 Right! 
 Pooch, why don't you e-mail your buddies at Langley and on the other side of the pond, see if any IRAs been popping up lately? 
 You got it. 
 (to Reilly) We work fast enough for you? 
 How long are we going to stay? 
 Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match 
 Political. 
 Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies.   Some insured, some not. (MORE) 
 Not bad for Bomb squad, eh? 
 Right. 
 I got a friend over at Scotland Yard who's gonna try and reach out to a undercover guy who would know if any of the rightwingers are circulating over here. Bev's following up on the briefcase manufacturers, too. 
 How're you guys doing? 
 It's a small fraternity, everyone knows everyone. I'm always recruiting. Pooch is ex- D.O.D., military expert... claymores, grenades. He played linebacker at Boston College, worked a K-9 unit - that led him to the Bomb Squad... great nose, lousy fingers, we try to keep him away from the tickers. T.J. is a heck of chemist, Texas A&M engineering degree. Found him in a Militia chat room - turns out we were both monitoring the same groups. Bev is the natural born hacker, we stole her from dispatch. She had the Cave reorganized and ultra-high-tech in two months. Captain has no idea how much hardware she's "found" for us. 
 We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments. 
 I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it.   See, when you beat one of these things... (MORE) 
 He set one, the son-of-a... 
 Alright.   Let's assess. 
 
. 
 Oh shit... 
 Okay, I'm going in, nobody breathe. 
 One shuts it down, one turns arms it. 
 I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire. 
 (smiles) Is this a great job or what? 
 I don't know, honey. I'll see. No, everything's fine, it was nothing. 
 Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly.      C'mon. 
 In case you change your mind. 
 What's this? 
 You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean. 
 But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it? 
 To recap, a gunman carrying what police described as a phony bomb was shot and killed less than an hour ago. 
 She talked. 
 More coffee, T.J.? 
 Mr. Reilly? 
 Time for bed, kiddos.   Say goodnight. 
 Can Uncle Teej tuck us in? 
 (to Glass, Reilly) Goodnight Uncle Charlie, goodnight Uncle Mike. 
 How long were you hooked? 
 You don't have to talk about it. 
 Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second. 
 Your partner? 
 Let me see. 
 No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you. 
 Congratulations, you just built your first ticker. 
 Alright! 
 Any word? 
 Nothing.    Maybe they gave up, split town. 
 One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol. 
 Coffee, Mike? 
 Yes, sir.   He's here.   I'll tell him. 
 Yes ... no, of course not but ... yes, sir, I understand. 
 She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk? 
 Reilly, I think I've shown that I'm a patient man. Rice was your biggest fan and I've tried to honor him by giving you some slack. But you are very close to running out of slack. 
 I read your report. Impressive. I'd say it's got detective written all over it. But... you cross the line one more time... you're gone. Are we clear? 
 I'll be outside. 
 Cover. (slowly, ashamed) It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away. 
 Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau. 
 There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138. 
 He's my brother... 
 People are dying. 
 Ex-girlfriend? 
 No. 
 On second thought, maybe I did. 
 Lemme see... yeah, here it is, 11:18 this morning. Very disrespectful. He used to drive a van, but he got a new car. You want the license number? 
 Ran the license plate - car was rented early this morning from a Hertz office downtown. 
 Alex Swan - demolitions expert, trained at Redstone, dropped out, freelanced in the middle East for awhile, then disappeared, no criminal record. The other one, Leveau, is French Canadian, he's a mercenary, record in half a dozen countries. 
 Get out an APB, now! 
." 
 Yes, sir. 
 (V.0) ... suspects driving a dark green Ford Grenada, license number one Two Eight Michael Vincent Edward ... 
 We've got company. 
 (O.C.) Roger that.   All available units... 
 Oh... damn. 
 KA-BOOOOOM!!! 
 Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and- 
 (ignoring Reilly) Glass, you're to stand by with your team. 
 It's our only option. 
 Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business- 
 You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon. 
 It's him! 
 Winters here. 
 SWAN'S VOICE You motherfuckers, you don't learn, do you?! 
 We're prepared to talk- 
 SWAN'S VOICE Shut up!    Shut up! 
 15... 
 SWAN'S VOICE You have exactly thirty minutes to release the girl where you found her. 
 Twelve ... 
 SWAN'S VOICE Thirty minutes. 
 Nine ... 
 How do we know you'll keep your word? 
 (to his men) Okay, let's move! 
 Get out and go to the machine shop - 
 She's out of the bag. 
 (O.C.) (on the radio) Position Four. Turning on Elm. 
 (speaks into sleave) Six.   She's crossing to Main. 
 Seal the building! (to Benson) Let's move. 
 (into sleave) We have contact. Black Camaro- 
 (O.C.) -license number HQW-256. 
 You okay? 
 Alex- 
 I know.   I warned them. 
 What is that? 
 Security. 
 C'mon, cowboy, you're next. 
 Okay, what's it gonna be? I got China White, Snow Flake, Ivory Pearl... 
 (impatient) Hey, asshole ... 
 Hey, I'm talking to you-- 
 You hungry?     We could get something to eat. 
 What's the matter? 
 Nothing... just tired. 
 Why are we stopping here? 
 We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes. 
 No...   No more killing. 
 Stay here. 
 Alex, please. 
 Stay in the truck. 
 
 (O.C.) Operator. 
 Get me the police! 
 (O.C.) Is this an emergency? 
 Yes! Please, hurry! 
 SERGEANT'S VOICE Police, Sergeant Doyle speaking. 
 Please, I need help, my name is-- 
 Who are you calling, sis? 
 What?    Nobody, I- 
 Alex, please- 
 Shut up! (into phone) Who is this? 
 Help! 
 Hey--? 
 All units, 211 reported at 8th and Sycamore. Suspect is a Caucasian male, armed with an automatic weapon, last seen heading east with female hostage in a U-Haul truck ... 
 Go ahead. 
 Aren't you on suspension? 
 Hang on. 
 T.J.'S T.J. here. 
 What's up? 
 Driving in circles, waiting for- 
 How do you know? 
 Should we head for the Interstate? 
 No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound... 
 (0.C.) (on radio) You got it. 
 (into mic) Reilly, what the hell are you-? 
 Pull back.   You're only an observer. 
 (O.C.) Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes- 
 
 Reilly!    He's loaded! 
 
 I want out, right now.      Or the whole city block is gone. 
 Reilly, he's got enough to do it. 
 Drop it. 
 (to Reilly) Take him! 
 Hold on to that thing tight. 
 Off the scale. 
 Can you hold it? 
 Right. 
 He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote. (beat) Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor. 
 Good, now the other side. 
 Okay, let's go in. 
 Close your eyes, feel your fingertips.   Tell me everything you feel. 
 Don't touch that. 
 Stay to your left. 
 That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait... 
 Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe. 
 Ease your thumb over to the right - feel anything? 
 Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down. 
 I don't know. 
 When in doubt, pull the yellow wire. 
 No excuses, just do it! 
 All clear, but we need an ambulance! 
 Mayor loves a hero. 
 Hey, you look great.

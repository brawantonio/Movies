 Now remember, keep your shoulders back. 
 Okay, put your arm around your brother. That's it. And breathe in. 
 Okay, one more. 
 Now just to review, you're going to follow along the procession until you get to the headmaster. At that point he will indicate to you to light the candles of the boys. 
 All right boys, let's settle down. 
 Banners up. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, boys, the light of knowledge. 
 One hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this room and were asked the same question that greets you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what are the four pillars? 
 Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence. 
 In her first year, Welton Academy graduated five students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And more than seventy-five percent of those went on to the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught here. This is why you parents have been sending us your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory school in the United States. 
 As you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English department retired last term. You will have the opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who, for the past several years, has been teaching at the highly regarded Chester School in London. 
 Glad you could come by. 
 Thrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan. 
 You've been away too long. 
 Hello Dr. Nolan. 
 Good to have you back. 
 This is our youngest, Todd. 
 Mr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill, young man. Your brother was one of our finest. 
 Thank you. 
 Lovely ceremony. 
 Thank you. So glad you liked it. 
 Gale 
 Tom 
 Good to see you again. 
 Hello Mr. Nolan. 
 Neil. We expect great things from you this year. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Well he won't disappoint us. Right Neil? 
 I'll do my best sir. 
 Hey, come on son. 
 Chin up. 
 No tears now. 
 Okay. 
 Chin up. 
 I don't want to go here. 
 You be a good boy and do your lessons. 
 Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates. 
 I'm Neil Perry. 
 Todd Anderson. 
 Why'd you leave Balincrest? 
 My brother went here. 
 Oh, so you're that Anderson. 
 This is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing you can give him some of those. 
 All right fine. 
 (to son) Did you remember your vaporizer? 
 Yes, I put it in my room. 
 Hey, how's it going Neil? 
 Hey Knox. 
 Neil, study group tonight? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new kid. Looks like a stiff! 
 Oops! 
 Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his foot in his mouth. You know what I mean? 
 Rumor has it, you did summer school. 
 Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead. How was your summer Slick? 
 Keen. 
 Meeks. Door. Closed. 
 Yes sir. 
 Gentlemen, what are the four pillars? 
 Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement. 
 Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study group. 
 Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind including him? 
 Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking? 
 Come on, he's your roommate. 
 That's not my fault. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks. 
 Oh, this is Todd Anderson. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Charlie Dalton. 
 Knox Overstreet. 
 Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson. 
 Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar. 
 Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton. 
 It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a genius like Meeks. 
 He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin. 
 And English, and Trig. 
 It's open. 
 Father, I thought you'd gone. 
 Mr. Perry. 
 Keep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking too many extra curricular activities this semester, and I've decided that you should drop the school annual. 
 But I'm the assistant editor this year. 
 Well I'm sorry Neil. 
 But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair. 
 Fellas, would you excuse us for a moment? 
 Don't you ever dispute me in public. Do you understand? 
 Father, I wasn't disputing- 
 After you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then you can do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you. Is that clear? 
 Yes sir. I'm sorry. 
 You know how much this means to your mother, don't you? 
 Yes sir. You know me, always taking on too much. 
 Well, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything, you let us know, huh? 
 Yes sir. 
 Why doesn't he let you do what you want? 
 Yeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse. 
 Oh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr. Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker. 
 Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do. 
 Well just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You guys are the same way. 
 All right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do? 
 What I have to do. Drop the annual. 
 Well I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan. 
 I don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it. 
 Well, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room? 
 Yes. 
 Todd, you're welcome to join us. 
 Yeah, come along pal. 
 Thanks. 
 Slow down boys, slow down you horrible phalanx of pubescense. 
 Pick three laboratory experiments from the project list and report on them every five weeks. The first twenty questions at the end of chapter one are due tomorrow. 
 (students repeat after each word.) Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae. Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas. Agrilcolis. 
 Your study of trigonometry requires absolute precision. Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge you now not to test me on this point. 
 Hey Spaz, Spaz. 
 Brain damage. 
 "To the virgins, to make much of time"? 
 "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still a flying, and this same flower that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying." 
 Carpe Diem. That's "seize the day." 
 Meeks. 
 Because he's in a hurry. 
 That was weird. 
 But different. 
 Spooky if you ask me. 
 Think he'll test us on that stuff? 
 Come on Cameron, don't you get anything? 
 What? What? 
 Let's go boys, hustle up in here. That means you Dalton. 
 Okay, who's up for a trig study group tonight guys? 
 Me. 
 Me. 
 (still annoyed by what the coach said) What? 
 I can't make it guys. I have to have dinner at the Danburry's house. 
 The Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's? 
 Big alumns. How'd you swing that? 
 Friends of my Dad's. They're probably in their nineties or something. 
 Ooh! 
 Anything's better than Hell-ton hash. 
 I'll second that. 
 Yeah we'll see. 
 Hey, you coming to the study group tonight? 
 Uh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I wanna do. 
 Suit yourself. 
 Ready Overstreet? 
 Ready to go sir. 
 (O.S.) Chet, can you get that? 
 (O.S.) I can't, Mom. 
 (O.S.) I'll get it. 
 Can I help you? 
 Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager. 
 Hi. 
 This is the Danburry's, right? 
 Are you here to see Chet? 
 Mrs. Danburry? 
 No. 
 Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry. You must be Knox. 
 Yes. 
 (to Dr. Hager) Back by nine. (to Knox) Please come in. 
 (O.S.) Chris, come on, what are you doing? 
 Chet, I'm coming. 
 Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry. 
 Nice to meet you sir. 
 Well he's the spitting image of his father, isn't he. How is he? Come on in. 
 (O.S.) Chris! 
 He's great. He just did a big case for GM. 
 (O.S.) I'm coming. 
 I know where you're headed, like father like son, huh? 
 Just replace these numbers here with "x", for "x" and "y". 
 Of course. 
 Of course, so what's the problem? 
 How was dinner? 
 Huh? 
 How was dinner? 
 Terrible. Awful. 
 Why? What happened? 
 Tonight, I met the most beautiful girl in my entire life. 
 Are you crazy? What's wrong with that? 
 She's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry. 
 That guy could eat a football. 
 That's too bad. 
 Too bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie, it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in love with such a jerk. 
 All the good ones go for jerks, you know that. 
 Ahh, forget her. Open your trig book and try and figure out problem five. 
 I can't just forget her Cameron. And I can't think about trig. 
 We got it. 
 Holy cow. 
 All right gentlemen, five minutes. Let's go. 
 Did you see her naked? 
 Very funny Dalton. 
 That wouldn't be a radio in your lap, would it Mr. Pitts? 
 No sir. Science experiment, radar. 
 Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech. Then ask two questions: One, how artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered, and two, how important is that objective. Question one rates the poem's perfection, question two rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining a poem's greatest becomes a relatively simple matter. 
 If the poem's score for perfection is plotted along the horizontal of a graph, and its importance is plotted on the vertical, then calculating the total area of the poem yields the measure of its greatness. 
 A sonnet by Byron may score high on the vertical, but only average on the horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on the other hand, would score high both horizontally and vertically, yielding a massive total area, thereby revealing the poem to be truly great. As you proceed through the poetry in this book, practice this rating method. As your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows, so will - so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry. 
 We shouldn't be doing this. 
 Rip, rip, rip! 
 What the hell is going on here? 
 Mr. Keating. 
 I'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were here. 
 Ahh, so you are. Excuse me. 
 Quite an interesting class you gave today, Mr. Keating. 
 Oh, there's no need to apologize. It was very fascinating, misguided though it was. 
 You take a big risk by encouraging them to be artists John. When they realize they're not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts, they'll hate you for it. 
 Free thinkers at seventeen? 
 (taken aback by the comment) Not a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll show you a happy man. 
 Tennyson? 
 Hey, I found his senior annual in the library. 
 Listen to this, captain of the soccer team, editor of the school annual, Cambridge bound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society. 
 (reading from the annual) Man most likely to do anything. 
 Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser. 
 What's the Dead Poets Society? 
 I don't know. 
 Is there a picture in the annual? 
 Nothing. No other mention of it. 
 MR. NOLAN (O.S.) That boy there, see me after lunch. 
 Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain, My Captain? 
 We were just looking in your old annual. 
 What was the Dead Poets Society? 
 Why? What was it? 
 Sure. 
 You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting around reading poetry? 
 Dead Poets Society. 
 What? 
 I say we go tonight. 
 Tonight? 
 Wait a minute. 
 Where's this cave he's talking about? 
 It's beyond the stream. I know where it is. 
 That's miles. 
 Sounds boring to me. 
 Don't go. 
 You know how many de-merits we're talking Dalton 
 So don't come, please. 
 Look, all I'm saying is that we have to be careful, we can't get caught. 
 No shit, Sherlock. 
 (yelling) You boys there, hurry up. 
 All right, who's in? 
 Come on Neil, Hager's right- 
 Forget Hager, no. Who's in? 
 I'm in. 
 (O.S.) I'm warning you, move. 
 Me too. 
 I don't know Neil 
 What? Pitts- 
 Pitsie, come on. 
 His grades are hurting Charlie. 
 You can help him Meeks. 
 What is this, a midnight study group? 
 Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks, are your grades hurting too? 
 I'll try anything once. 
 Except sex. 
 Ha ha ha. 
 I mean as long as we're careful. 
 What about you Knox? 
 I don't know Charlie. 
 Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris. 
 Yeah? How? 
 Women swoon. 
 But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me why they swoon. Charlie! 
 (whispering) Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall. It's right there. It's got to be on the banks. 
 I don't know, it's starting to sound dangerous. 
 Well, why don't you stay home? 
 For God's sake stop chattering and sit down. 
 Todd, are you coming tonight? 
 No. 
 Why not? God, you were there. You heard Keating. Don't you want to do something about it? 
 Yes, but- 
 But? But what? 
 Keating said that everybody took turns reading and I don't want to do that. 
 Gosh, you really have a problem with that, don't you? 
 N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil, I just- I just don't want to do it, okay? 
 All right. What if you didn't have to read? What if you just came and listened? 
 That's not how it works. 
 Forget how it works. What if - what if they said it was okay? 
 What? What are you gonna do, go up and ask them? 
 No. No, Neil. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Neil, Neil! 
 Oh shut up, will you. 
 That's my- that's for my asthma, okay. Could you give that back please? Could you give that back? 
 What's the matter? Don't you like snakes? 
 You're in. 
 Get away from me, okay? 
 Spaz, why don't you check your pocket, huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my teeth 
 Get a- get off, 
 Cut out that racket in there. 
 Arrr, I'm a dead poet. 
 Aww, Charlie. 
 (laughing) Guys, over here. 
 You're funny. You're real funny. 
 It's too wet. 
 God, are you trying to smoke us out of here? 
 No, no, the smoke's going right up this opening. 
 You okay? 
 Oh God. Clowns. 
 All right, all right, forget the fire. Let's go gentlemen. 
 I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets Society. 
 Welton chapter. The meetings will be conducted by myself and the other new initiates now present. Todd Anderson, because he prefers not to read, will keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now read the traditional opening message by society member Henry David Thoreau. "I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life." 
 I'll second that. 
 "To put to rout all that was not life, and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived. 
 And Keating's marked a bunch of other pages. 
 All right, intermission. Dig deep right here. Right here, lay it down 
 On the mud? We're gonna put our food on the mud? 
 Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket. 
 Yes sir, use Meeks' coat. 
 Don't keep anything back either. You guys are always bumming my smokes. 
 Raisins? 
 Yuck. 
 Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll? 
 (talking with his mouth full) I'm eating the other half. 
 Come on. 
 You want me to put it back? 
 It was a dark and rainy night, and this old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw puzzles, sat by herself in her house at her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle. But as she pieced the puzzle together, she realized, to her astonishment, that the image that was formed was her very own room. And the figure in the center of the puzzle, as she completed it, was herself. And with trembling hands, she placed the last four pieces and stared in horror at the face of a demented madman at the window. The last thing that this old lady ever heard was the sound of breaking glass. 
 Ohhh… no… 
 This is true, this is true. 
 I've got one that's even better than that. 
 Ha! 
 I do. There's a young, married couple, and they're driving through the forest at night on a long trip. And they run out of gas, and there's a madman on the- 
 The thing with the hand- 
 I love that story. 
 I told you that one. 
 You did not. I got that in camp in sixth grade. 
 When were you in six, last year? 
 "In a mean abode in the shanking road, lived a man named William Bloat. Now, he had a wife, the plague of his life, who continually got his goat. And one day at dawn, with her nightshift on, he slit her bloody throat." 
 Oh, and it gets worse. 
 You want to hear a real poem? 
 All right? No, I don't need it. You take it. 
 What, did you bring one? 
 You memorized a poem? 
 I didn't memorize a poem. Move up. 
 An original piece by Charlie Dalton. 
 An original piece. 
 Take center stage. 
 You know this is history. Right? This is history. 
 Oh, wow. 
 Where did you get that? 
 
 The god of love, if such a thing there be, may learn to love from me. 
 Wow! Did you write that? 
 Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next? 
 Alfred Lord Tennyson. Come my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world for my purpose holds to sail beyond the sunset. And though we are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;-- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will. To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. 
 Then I had religion, then I had a vision. I could not turn from their revel in derision. Then I saw the Congo creeping through the black, cutting through the forest with a golden track. Then I saw the Congo creeping through the black- 
 Meeks, Meeks. 
 
 
 Morose? 
 Uh, to communicate. 
 Oh, God! 
 To feel taller. 
 MR. NOLAN Take a power train in two! Three! Keep your eyes in the boat! 
 We got it, Pittsie. We got it! Radio Free America! 
 I found it. 
 You found what? 
 What I wanna do right now. What's really, really inside me. 
 "A Midsummer Night's Dream"? 
 This is it. 
 What is this? 
 It's a play, dummy. 
 I know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have to do with you? 
 Right. They're putting it on at Henley Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts! 
 Yes, so? 
 So, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna be an actor! Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to try this. I even tried to go to summer stock auditions last year, but, of course, my father wouldn't let me. For the first time in my whole life I know what I wanna do. 
 and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem! 
 Neil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you? 
 First I gotta get the part, then I can worry about that. 
 Yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds out you went to an audition and didn't even tell him? 
 No, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of this. 
 Well, that's impossible. 
 Bullshit! Nothing's impossible. 
 Well, why don't you just call him and ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes. 
 That's a laugh! 
 If I don't ask him, at least I won't be disobeying him. 
 Yeah, but if he said-- 
 (shouting angrily) Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on? 
 I mean, I haven't even gotten the part yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a little while? 
 You're coming to the meeting this afternoon? 
 I don't know. Maybe. 
 Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it, Todd? 
 W-What is that supposed to mean? 
 You're in the club! Being in the club means being stirred up by things. You look about as stirred up as a cesspool. 
 So- You want me out? 
 No! I want you in, but being in means you gotta do something. Not just say you're in. 
 Well, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this concern, but I-I'm not like you. All right? You, you, you say thing and people listen. I'm, I'm not like that. 
 Don't you think you could be? 
 No! I--I, I don't know, but that's not the point. The, the, the point is that there's nothing you can do about it, so you can just butt out. I can take care of myself just fine. All right? 
 No. 
 What do you mean, "no"? 
 No. 
 Give me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. 
 "We are dreaming of a--" Poetry! I'm being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, okay. 
 What are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You see this chemistry- 
 Hey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be immature. Come on. I need my- 
 Give it to me! Give it to me! 
 Charlie! 
 Let me have my book, I need my- 
 Okay, everybody on the bus. Let's go, boys. Come on, let's go. On the bus, boys. Now! 
 "Oh to struggle against great odds. To meet enemies undaunted." 
 "Oh to struggle against great odds. To meet enemies undaunted." 
 1 "To be a sailor of the world, bound for all ports." 
 2 "Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave." 
 3 "To mount the scaffolds. To advance to the muzzle of guns with perfect nonchalance." 
 "To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout, skip, roll on, float on." 
 (without energy) "Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of new joys." 
 "To indeed be a god!" 
 Charlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play Puck! I'm gonna play Puck! 
 What did he say? 
 Puck? 
 That's the main part. 
 Great, Neil. 
 Charlie, I got it! 
 Congratulations. Good for you, Neil. Good for you. 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 Neil, how are you gonna do this? 
 They need a letter of permission from my father and Mr. Nolan. 
 You're not gonna write it. 
 Oh yes, I am. 
 Oh, Neil. Neil, you're crazy. 
 Okay. "I am writing to you on behalf of my son Neil Perry." 
 This is great. 
 (quietly) "To Chris." 
 1 Who's Chris? 
 2 Mmm, Chris. 
 I see a sweetness in her smile. Blight light shines from her eyes. But life is complete; contentment is mine, Just knowing that... 
 just knowing that she's alive. 
 Sorry, Captain. It's stupid. 
 "The cat sat on the mat." 
 I, I didn't do it. I didn't write a poem. 
 A yawp? 
 (quietly) Yawp. 
 (quietly) Yawp. 
 Yawp. 
 (shouting) Yawp! 
 A m-m-madman. 
 A c-crazy madman. 
 Uh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman. 
 Uh, I-I close my eyes. 
 Uh, and this image floats beside me. 
 A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain. 
 H-His hands reach out and choke me. 
 And, and all the time he's mumbling. 
 M-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold." 
 Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough. You kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us. From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying, it will just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream. 
 Attaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply. 
 My dad collects a lot of pipes. 
 Really? Mine's got thirty. 
 Your parents collect pipes? Oh, that's really interesting. 
 Come on, Knox. Join in. 
 Yeah, Knox, we're from the government. We're here to help, man. 
 What's wrong? 
 It's Chris. Here's a picture of Chris for you. 
 Smoke that. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. 
 That's not funny. 
 Knock it off. Smoke your pipes. 
 Neil! 
 Friend, scholar, Welton men. 
 What is that, Neil? 
 Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks. 
 No. This is the god of the cave. 
 The god of the cave. 
 Charlie, what are you doing? 
 What do you say we start this meeting? 
 1 Y-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just gotta- 
 2 Got my earplugs? 
 Gentlemen, "Poetrusic" by Charles Dalton. 
 Oh, no. 
 Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling. Gotta do more. Gotta be more. 
 Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta do more! Gotta be more! 
 Wow! 
 That was nice. That was great. Where did you learn to play like that? 
 My parents made me take the clarinet for years. 
 I love the clarinet. 
 I hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone is more sonorous. 
 Ooh. 
 Vocabulary. 
 I can't take it anymore. If I don't have Chris, I'm gonna kill myself. 
 Knoxious, you've gotta calm down. 
 No, Charlie. That's just my problem. I've been calm all my life. I'll do something about that. 
 Where are you going? 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I'm gonna call her. 
 (O.S.) Hello? 
 She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will hate me. My parents will kill me. All right, goddamn it. You're right. "Carpe diem." Even if it kills me. 
 (O.S.) Hello? 
 Hello, Chris? 
 (O.S.) Yes. 
 Hi. This is Knox Overstreet. 
 (O.S.) Oh, yes. Knox. Glad you called. 
 She's glad I called. 
 (O.S.) Listen, Chet's parents are going out of town this weekend, so he's having a party. Would you like to come? 
 Would I like to come to a party? 
 Yes. Say, yes. 
 (O.S.) Friday? Um- 
 Well, sure. 
 (O.S.) About seven? 
 Okay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris. 
 (O.S.) Okay. 
 Friday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay. Thank you. 
 (O.S.) Okay. Bye. 
 Thank you. I'll see you. Bye. 
 Yawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna call me. She invited me to a party with her. 
 At Chet Danburry's house. 
 Yeah. 
 Well? 
 So? 
 So, you don't really think she means you're going with her? 
 Well, of course not, Charlie. But that's not the point. That's not the point at all. 
 What is the point? 
 The point, Charlie, is, uh-- 
 Yeah? 
 that she was thinking about me. I've only met her once, and already she's thinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna happen, guys. I feel it. She is going to be mine. Carpe. Carpe! 
 I don't know, but I've been told-- 
 Doing poetry is old-- 
 Exercising the right not to walk. 
 Todd? Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What's going on? 
 Nothing. Today's my birthday. 
 Is today your birthday? Happy birthday. 
 Thanks. 
 What's you get? 
 My parents gave me this. 
 Isn't this the same desk set- 
 Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing as last year. 
 Oh. 
 Oh. 
 (laughing) Maybe they thought you needed another one. 
 Maybe they weren't thinking about anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is about this is I, I didn't even like it the first time. 
 Todd, I think you're underestimating the value of this desk set. 
 I mean, who would want a football or a baseball, or- 
 Or a car. 
 Or a car if they could have a desk set as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if I were ever going to buy a, a desk set twice, I would probably buy this one both times. In fact, its, its shape is, it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can feel it. This desk set wants to fly. 
 Todd? The world's first unmanned flying desk set. 
 Oh, my! 
 Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get another one next year. 
 "To live deep and suck out all the marrow of life. To put to rout all that was not life" 
 Oh, my God! 
 Is this it? 
 Yeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in. It's my cave. Watch your step. 
 We're not gonna slip, are we? 
 Uh-oh. 
 Hi. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Hi, you guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and-- 
 Tina. 
 Tina. This is the pledge class of the Dead Poets Society. 
 Hello. How do you do? 
 Hello. 
 Hi. Hi. 
 Guys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's Friday night. Let's get on with the meeting. 
 Sorry. Excuse- Excuse me. 
 Guys, I have an announcement to make. In keeping with the spirit of passionate experimentation of the Dead Poets, I'm giving up the name Charlie Dalton. From now on, call me Nuwanda. 
 (laughing) Nuwanda? 
 Nuwanda? 
 Hello? Hello, Chris? 
 Knox! 
 Hi. 
 You made it. Great! Bring anybody? 
 No. 
 No. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have to go find Chet. Why don't you go downstairs where everybody is? 
 Make yourself at home. 
 But I-- 
 Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba, this guy look like Mutt Sanders to you or what? 
 You're his brother? 
 No relation. Never heard of him. Sorry, guys. 
 (obviously drunk) Where's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders' brother, we don't even offer him a drink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal. 
 Yeah. 
 Whoa, I, uh, I don't really drink-- 
 To Mutt. 
 To Mutt. 
 To Mutt. 
 Now, how the hell is old Mutt, anyway? 
 Yeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh? 
 I don't really know Mutt. 
 To Mighty Mutt. 
 1 To Mighty Mutt. 
 To Mighty Mutt. 
 Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say hello to Mutt for me, okay? 
 Will do. 
 Yeah. Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt. 
 We gonna have a meeting or what? 
 Yeah. If you guys don't have a meeting, how do we know if we wanna join? 
 Join? 
 "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate." 
 That's so sweet. 
 I made that up just for you. 
 You did? 
 I'll write one for you too, Gloria. She walks in beauty like the night. She walks in beauty like the night. Of cloudless climes and starry skies. All that's best, dark and bright, Meet in her aspect and her eyes. 
 That's beautiful. 
 There's plenty more where that came from. 
 God help me. 
 Carpe diem. 
 Chet! Chet! Look! 
 What? 
 It's Mutt Sanders' brother. 
 Huh? 
 Knox, what-- 
 And he's feeling up your girl! 
 What are you doing? 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Chet! Chet, don't. 
 Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but you've gotta- 
 Chet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop it! Leave him alone! 
 Goddamn! 
 Chet, stop it! 
 Bastard! 
 Knox, are you all right? 
 Chris, get the hell away from him! 
 Chet, you hurt him! 
 Good! 
 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 It's okay. It-It's okay. 
 Next time I see you, you die. 
 Go ahead, pass it around. 
 Me and Pitts are working on a hi-fi system. It shouldn't be that hard to, uh, to put together. 
 Yeah. Uh, I might be going to Yale. Uh, uh, but, I, I might not. 
 Don't you guys miss having girls around here? 
 That's part of what this club is about. In fact, I'd like to announce I published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets. 
 What? 
 Demanding girls be admitted to Welton. 
 You didn't. 
 (whispering to Meeks) So we can all stop beating off. 
 How did you do that? 
 I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in. 
 Look, uh, it's, it's over now. 
 Why? Nobody knows who we are. 
 Well, don't you think they're gonna figure out who wrote it? They're gonna come to you and ask to know what the Dead Poets Society is. Charlie, you had no right to do something like that. 
 It's Nuwanda, Cameron. 
 That's right. It's Nuwanda. 
 Are we just playing around out here, or do we mean what we say? For all we do is come together and reach a bunch of poems to each other. What the hell are we doing? 
 All right, but you still shouldn't have done it, Charlie. This could mean trouble. You don't speak for the club. 
 Hey, would you not worry about your precious little neck? If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up. 
 MR. NOLAN Sit. 
 MR. NOLAN In this week of Welton's Honor there appeared a profane and unauthorized article. Rather than spend my valuable time ferreting out the guilty persons -- and let me assure you I will find them - - I'm asking any and all students who knows anything about this article to make themselves known here and now. Whoever the guilty persons are, this is your only chance to avoid expulsion from this school. 
 Welton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just a moment. 
 Mr. Nolan, it's for you. It's God. He says we should have girls at Welton. 
 MR. NOLAN Wipe that smirk off your face. If you think, Mr. Dalton, that you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again. Others have had similar notions and have failed just as surely as you will fail. Assume the position. 
 MR. NOLAN Count aloud, Mr. Dalton. 
 One. Two. Three. Four. Five. 
 MR. NOLAN What is this Dead Poets Society? I want names. 
 You kicked out? 
 No. 
 So what happened? 
 I'm to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven. 
 So, what are you gonna do? Charlie! 
 Damn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda. 
 MR. NOLAN Excuse me. May we have a word, Mr. Keating? 
 MR. NOLAN This was my first classroom, John. Did you know that? My first desk. 
 MR. NOLAN English. Oh, long before your time. It was hard giving it up, I can tell you. I'm hearing rumors, John, about some unorthodox teaching methods in your classroom. I'm not saying they've anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst. But I don't think I have to warn you boys his age are very impressionable. 
 MR. NOLAN What was going on in the courtyard the other day? 
 MR. NOLAN Yeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison. 
 MR. NOLAN Well, John, the curriculum here is set. It's proven it works. If you question, what's to prevent them from doing the same? 
 MR. NOLAN At these boys' ages? Not on your life! Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself. 
 Creak. He started walking around towards my left. Creak. Creak. "Assume the position, Mr. Dalton." 
 Mr. Keating. 
 You're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about Carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that? 
 But I thought you'd like that. 
 Yeah. Like what? 
 Aye, aye, Captain. 
 Yes, Captain. 
 All right. Go on. 
 We're trying to rehearse, okay? Start. 
 A good persuasion, therefore hear me, Hermia. 
 Wait, please. Excitement. I don't hear any excitement about this play. And take her hand. Bring her down the stage and stop. And "There, gentle Hermia." Okay? Try again. 
 What's for dinner? 
 Spaghetti and meatballs! 
 Save some for me. "But, room, Fairy! Here comes Oberon." 
 Father. 
 MR. PERRY Neil. 
 Wait a minute. Before you say anything, please let me ex- 
 MR. PERRY Don't you dare talk back to me! It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this, this absurd acting business. But you deliberately deceived me! How, how, how did you expect to get away with this? Answer me. Who put you up to it? Was it this new man? This, uh, Mr. Keating? 
 No. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you. I've gotten all A's in every class. 
 MR. PERRY Did you think I wasn't going to find out? "Oh, my niece is in a play with your son," says Mrs. Marks. "No, no, no," I say, "you must be mistaken. My son's not in a play." You made me a liar of me, Neil! Now, tomorrow you go to them and you tell them that you're quitting. 
 No, I can't. I have the main part. The performance is tomorrow night. 
 MR. PERRY I don't care if the world comes to an end tomorrow night. You are through with that play. Is that clear? Is that clear? 
 Yes, sir. 
 MR. PERRY I made a great many sacrifices to get you here, Neil, and you will not let me down. 
 No, sir. 
 Can I speak to you a minute? 
 I'm sorry. Here. 
 Tea. Sure. 
 No, thanks. 
 Gosh, they don't give you much room around here. 
 She's pretty. 
 How can you stand it? 
 You can go anywhere. You can do anything. How can you stand being here? 
 I just talked to my father. He's making me quit the play at Henley Hall. Acting's everything to me. I-- But he doesn't know. He-- I can see his point. We're not a rich family like Charlie's, and we-- But he's planning the rest of my life for me, and I-- H-He's never asked me what I want. 
 I can't. 
 I can't talk to him this way. 
 I know what he'll say. He'll tell me that acting's a whim, and I should forget it. That how they're counting on me. He'll just tell me to put it out of my mind, "for my own good." 
 No. What about the play? The show's tomorrow night. 
 Isn't there an easier way? 
 I'm trapped. 
 Chris! 
 Chris Noel. Do you know where she is? 
 Um, I think she's in room 111. 
 Thanks. 
 Excuse me. Chris. 
 Knox, what are you doing here? 
 I came to apologize for the other night. I brought you these and a poem I wrote for you. 
 Knox, don't you know that, if Chet finds you here he'll kill you? 
 I can't care. I love you, Chris. 
 Knox, you're crazy. 
 Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it. Please, accept these. Please. 
 No. No-- I, I can't. Forget it. 
 Knox, I don't believe this. 
 All I'm asking you to do is listen. 
 The heavens made a girl named Chris With hair and skin of gold. To touch her would be paradise. 
 Get out of here. Cameron, you fool. 
 Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to her? 
 Yeah. 
 What'd she say? 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? 
 Nothing. But I did it. 
 What did she say? I know she had to say something. 
 Come here, Knox. 
 Seize the day! 
 Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at least he's letting me stay in the play. He won't be able to make, make it. He's in Chicago. But, uh, I think he's gonna let me stay with acting. 
 Yeah. He wasn't happy. But he'll be gone at least four days. I don't think he'll make the show, but I think he'll let me stay with it. "Keep up the school work." Thanks. 
 Beautiful baby. 
 Beautiful baby. Henley Hall, here I come. 
 Excuse me, just a moment. Yes. You're so cute. 
 Come on, Todd. I'm trying to fix this. 
 Come on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss Neil's entrance. 
 He said something about getting red before we left. 
 Getting red? What does that mean? 
 I, uh-- Well, you know Charlie. 
 So, Charlie, what's this "getting red" bit? 
 W-What is that? 
 It's an Indian warrior symbol for virility. Makes me feel potent, like it can drive girls crazy. 
 Oh, come on, Charlie. The girls are waiting. 
 Chris. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up. 
 Yeah, come on, guys. 
 Chris, you can't be in here. I-If they catch you, we're both gonna be in big trouble. 
 Oh, but it's fine-- 
 It's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me? 
 I didn't mean to make a fool out of you. 
 Well, you did. Chet found out. And it took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. Knox, you have got to stop this stuff. 
 I can't, Chris. I love you. 
 Knox, you say that over and over. You don't, you don't even know me. 
 Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk. 
 Knox, Knox, it just so happens that I could care less about you? 
 Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet. 
 I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the play. 
 Are you going with him? 
 (laughs) Chet? To a play? Are you kidding? 
 Then come with me. 
 Knox, you are so infuriating. 
 Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come with me tonight. And then, if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out. 
 You know what would happen if Chet found out? 
 He won't know anything. We'll sit in the back and sneak away as soon as it's over. 
 And I suppose you would promise that this would be the end of it. 
 Dead Poets Honor. 
 What is that? 
 My word. 
 You are so infuriating. 
 Hey, there he is! Hey, hey. 
 
 
 I am that merry wanderer of the night. I jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, 
 Neighing in likeness of a filly foal: And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl, In very likeness of a roasted crab, And when she drinks, against her lips I bob And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale. The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, 
 (whispering) He's good. He's really good. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Neil. That's your cue, Neil. Come on, Neil. Here's your crown. Let's go. 
 
 Think but this, and all is mended, That you have but slumber'd here While these visions did appear. And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding but a dream, Gentles, do not reprehend: If you pardon, we will mend: And, as I am an honest Puck, If we have unearned luck Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, We will make amends ere long; Else the Puck a liar call; So, good night unto you all. Give me your hands, if we be friends, And Robin shall restore amends. 
 Yawp! 
 Yeah, Neil! 
 MR. PERRY Excuse me, I'm Neil's father. I need to see him. 
 Neil, Your father. He's- 
 What did you think? 
 Really I thought you were all just wonderful! 
 MR. PERRY Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 Neil, Neil, you were great. 
 I can't, guys. 
 Neil! Neil! 
 MR. PERRY Get in the car. Keating, you stay away from my son. 
 Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on. 
 Is it okay if we walk back? Captain? 
 Knox. 
 MR. PERRY We're trying very hard to understand why it is that you insist on defying us. Whatever the reason, we're not gonna let you ruin your life. Tomorrow I'm withdrawing you from Welton and enrolling you in Braden Military School. You're going to Harvard and you're gonna be a doctor. 
 But that's ten more years. Father, that's a lifetime! 
 MR. PERRY Oh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You make it sound like a prison term. You don't understand, Neil. You have opportunities that I never even dreamt of and I am not going to let you waste them. 
 I've got to tell you what I feel. 
 MRS. PERRY We've been so worried about-- 
 MR. PERRY What? What? Tell me what you feel. What is it? 
 MR. PERRY Is it more of this, this acting business? Because you can forget that. What? 
 Nothing. 
 MR. PERRY Nothing? Well, then, let's go to bed. 
 I was good. I was really good. 
 MRS. PERRY Go on, get some sleep. 
 MR. PERRY It's all right. It's going to be all right. 
 MR. PERRY What was that? 
 MRS. PERRY What? 
 MR. PERRY That sound. 
 MRS. PERRY What sound? Tom? 
 MRS. PERRY What is it? What's wrong? 
 MR. PERRY Neil. 
 MRS. PERRY Tom, what is it? What's wrong? Neil? 
 MR. PERRY Neil? 
 MRS. PERRY I'll look outside. Neil? 
 MR. PERRY No! 
 MR. PERRY Oh, Neil! Oh, my God! 
 MRS. PERRY Oh! No! 
 MR. PERRY Oh, my son! 
 MRS. PERRY He's all right. 
 MR. PERRY My son! My poor son! 
 MRS. PERRY (crying hysterically) He's all right! He's all right! He's all right! He's all right! He's all right! He's all right! 
 MR. PERRY Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. 
 Todd? Todd. 
 Oh, Charlie. 
 What is it? 
 Neil's dead. 
 It's so beautiful. 
 Todd. It's okay, Todd. 
 Calm down. 
 It's all right, Todd. 
 Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd. 
 It's all right. It's alright. 
 He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it. 
 You can't explain it, Todd. 
 It was his father! 
 No! 
 He wouldn't have left us. It's because he- He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his father did it. 
 Todd. 
 His father killed him. He made him do it. 
 You can't explain it, Todd. 
 Todd! 
 Leave him be. 
 (singing) All my life Thy light shall surely follow me And in God's house forevermore My dwelling place shall be Amen. 
 MR. NOLAN The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He was a fine student. One of Welton's best. And he will be missed. We've contacted each of your parents to explain the situation. Naturally, they're all quite concerned. At the request of Neil's family, I intend to conduct a thorough inquiry into this matter. Your complete cooperation is expected. 
 You told him about this meeting? 
 Twice. 
 That's it, guys. We're all fried. 
 How do you mean? 
 Cameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office right now, finking. 
 About what? 
 The club, Pittsie. Think about it. The board of directors, the trustees and Mr. Nolan. Do you think for one moment they're gonna let this thing just blow over? Schools go down because of things like this. They need a scapegoat. 
 What's going on, guys? 
 You finked, didn't you, Cameron? 
 Finked? I didn't know what the hell you're talking about. 
 You told Nolan everything about the club is what I'm talking about. 
 Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, there's something called an honor code at this school, all right? If a teacher asks you a question, you tell the truth or you're expelled. 
 You little- 
 Charlie! 
 He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes, so he rattled to save himself. 
 Don't touch him, Charlie. You do and you're out. 
 I'm out anyway! 
 You don't know that, not yet. 
 He's right there, Charlie. And if you guys are smart, you will do exactly what I did and cooperate. They're not after us. We're the victims. Us and Neil. 
 What's that mean? Who are they after? 
 Why, Mr. Keating, of course. The "Captain" himself. I mean, you guys didn't really think he could avoid responsibility, did you? 
 Mr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is that what they're saying? 
 Well, who else do you think, dumb ass? The administration? Mr. Perry? Mr. Keating put us up to all this crap, didn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating, Neil would be cozied up in his room right now, studying his chemistry and dreaming of being called doctor. 
 That is not true, Cameron. You know that. He didn't put us to anything. Neil loved acting. 
 Believe what you want, but I say let Keating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives? 
 You just signed your expulsion papers, Nuwanda. 
 And if the rest of you are smart, you'll do exactly what I did. They know everything anyway. You can't save Keating, but you can save yourselves. 
 Knox Overstreet. 
 Meeks? 
 Go away. I have to study. 
 What happened to Nuwanda? 
 Expelled. 
 What'd you tell 'em? 
 Nothing they didn't already know. 
 (O.S.) Todd Anderson. 
 MR. ANDERSON Hello, son. 
 MRS. ANDERSON Hello, darling. 
 Mom. 
 MR. NOLAN Have a seat, Mr. Anderson. 
 MR. NOLAN Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well put together what's happened here. You do admit to being a part of this Dead Poets Society? 
 MR. ANDERSON Answer him, Todd. 
 Yes, sir. 
 MR. NOLAN I have here a detailed description of what occurred at your meetings. It describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, encouraged you boys to organize this club and to use it as a source of inspiration for reckless and self- indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. Keating, both in and out of the classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to follow his obsession with acting when he knew all along it was against the explicit order of Neil's parents. It was Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his position as teacher that led directly to Neil Perry's death. 
 MR. NOLAN Read that document carefully, Todd. Very carefully. 
 MR. NOLAN If you've nothing to add or amend, sign it. 
 What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating? 
 MR. ANDERSON I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd. 
 MR. NOLAN Sit. 
 MR. NOLAN I'll be teaching this class through exams. We'll find a permanent English teacher during the break. Who will tell me where you are in the Pritchard textbook? 
 MR. NOLAN Mr. Anderson? 
 Uh, in the, in the Pr- 
 MR. NOLAN I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson. 
 In the, in the, in the Pritchard? 
 MR. NOLAN Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. 
 We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered the Romantics and some of the chapters on Post Civil War literature. 
 MR. NOLAN What about the Realists? 
 I believe we skipped most of that, sir. 
 MR. NOLAN All right, then, we'll start over. What is poetry? 
 MR. NOLAN Come. 
 MR. NOLAN Get them now, Mr. Keating. 
 MR. NOLAN Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on "Understanding Poetry." 
 That page has been ripped out, sir. 
 MR. NOLAN Well, borrow somebody else's book. 
 They're all ripped out, sir. 
 MR. NOLAN What do you mean, they're all ripped out? 
 Sir, we, uh- 
 MR. NOLAN Never mind. 
 MR. NOLAN Read! 
 "Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then ask two questions: 1) How artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered and 2)..." 
 "... How important is that objective? Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; question 2 rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining the poem's greatness becomes a relatively simple matter. If the poem's score for perfection is plotted on the horizontal of a graph--" 
 Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign it. 
 MR. NOLAN Quiet, Mr. Anderson. 
 You gotta believe me. It's true. 
 MR. NOLAN Leave, Mr. Keating. 
 But it wasn't his fault! 
 MR. NOLAN Sit down, Mr. Anderson! 
 MR. NOLAN One more outburst from you or anyone else, and you're out of this school! Leave, Mr. Keating. 
 MR. NOLAN I said leave, Mr. Keating. 
 O Captain! My Captain! 
 MR. NOLAN Sit down, Mr. Anderson! 
 MR. NOLAN Do you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This is your final warning, Anderson. How dare you? Do you hear me? 
 O Captain! My Captain! 
 MR. NOLAN Mr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down! 
 MR. NOLAN Sit down! Sit down. All of you. I want you seated. Sit down. Leave, Mr. Keating. 
 MR. NOLAN All of you, down. I want you seated. Do you hear me? 
 MR. NOLAN

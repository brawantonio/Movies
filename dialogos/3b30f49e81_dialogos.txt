 DAVID (CONT'D) That is what the cynics used to say..Companies would refuse to look to the future..They'd say `Can we stop this virus"? 
 DAVID(O.S.) (CONT'D) As if it was a negative progression, a descent into hell, moving with stealth amongst those you need to affect, growing more and more with a momentum that is unstoppable. 
 DAVID (CONT'D) Now, some inane kid snorting the entire load of his mother's spice cupboard and posts that on You Tube. They would watch as it would become the buzzword amongst high school kids everywhere. Eventually..their cynicism would turn to awe.

 Do I? No. 
 Well, what's a date?

 Well, yeah. I mean, I just don't understand why people would want to get married. Especially nowadays, I mean, it's.. You know.. I don't see the point. 
 In relationships? 57. 
 It doesn't seem realistic. 
 Are you serious? I mean.. 
 Yeah, I am, really. 
 (LAUGHS) Well, then, you know, why are we here, if we don't matter to one another? 
 Well.. 
 Why are you here? 
 The food's supposed to be really great here. (LAUGHS) 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) No, no, no, no. I'm not.. I'm not saying it like that. I mean, I just mean, you know.. One person for the rest of your life? I mean, it's.. I mean, you know, you come to restaurants, you see couples sitting together and they don't even speak to one another. They don't have anything to say, they don't have anything. 
 They probably don't have to speak because they're connected. 
 Or they're just bored with one another. 
 Every.. 
 WAITER (OVER) Here we go.

 No, seriously, seriously. Touch it. 
 OK. 
 MARIANNE (CONT'D) Oh, my God. 
 Do you feel that? 
 Yeah, what is it? 
 It's a remnant. 
 A remnant? 60. 
 Yeah, from the Neanderthals. There's only a few of us left since the homo sapiens took over. 
 MARIANNE (OVER) OK. Hmm.. That would explain the forehead. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 `What's that supposed to mean?' 
 What do you mean? 
 (CHUCKLES) No, seriously, how did you get it? 
 (COUGHS) I used to play this game with my cousin. 
 Hm-hmm. 
 Where I would sit on his feet and he'd fly me through the air. I hit my head on the ceiling and I blacked out. 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) I was knocked out for 5-10 minutes. I peed my pants. 
 (Reacts Sympathetically) Oh. 
 If you had a choice to live in the past or future and you could be anything you wanted, what would you be? 
 What would you be? 
 I always wanted to be a musician in the sixties. 61. 
 That's cool A musician? 
 Yeah. 
 Sixties is tough though. I saw GIMME SHELTER recently, you know the Rolling Stones documentary? 
 Yeah. 
 It kind of seemed like hell. 
 What? 
 (LAUGHS) Yeah, the sixties would be the last place I'd want to be. 
 No way! 
 Yes. Eugh, chaos! 
 So where would you wanna, and what would you wanna be? 
 Erm.. You know. Here, now. 
 That's boring 
 Fuck you. (LAUGHS) 
 MARIANNE (CONT'D) OK. Well, this is me. 
 This is you. 
 Thank you very much Brandon. 
 Thank you very much MARIANNE. We should do this again.

 SISSY (O.S.) (CONT'D) Have you eaten? 
 No. 
 (O.S.) Are you hungry? 
 No. 
 Can you just give me a hug? 
 He's not gonna screw you again. 
 
 (SIGHS). 
 You left a message didn't you? You can't help yourself. It's disgusting. 
 Why are you so fucking angry? 
 Why am I so fucking angry? That's my boss! You sleep with him after twenty minutes and now you're calling him up? What's the matter with you? You know he's got a family, right? You know he's got a family? 
 No. 
 You didn't see the wedding ring on his finger? 
 No. 
 You're a liar. 
 I'm sorry 
 You're always sorry. 
 At least- 
 BRANDON (OVER) That's all you ever fucking say! 
 SISSY (OVER) Well, least I say I'm sorry. 73. 
 Try doing something, actions count! Not words. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I fucked up. I'm not perfect. But I'm...trying. 
 Some people fuck up all the time. 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) Look, just forget it. This isn't working out. Obviously. You need to find somewhere else to live. 
 I don't have anywhere else to go. (beat) This isn't about him. I make you angry all the time and I don't know why. 
 No. You trap me. You force me into a corner and you trap me. "I've got nowhere else to go." I mean, what sort of fucking shit is that? 
 You're my brother. 
 So what, I'm responsible for you? 
 Yes! 
 No I'm not! 
 Yes you fucking are! 
 BRANDON (OVER) I didn't give birth to you! I didn't bring you into this world. 
 You're my brother, I'm your sisterm. We're family. We're meant to look after each other. 74. 
 You're not looking after me. 
 I'm- 
 BRANDON (OVER) I'm looking after myself. 
 SISSY (OVER) I'm trying to help you! 
 How are you helping me? Huh? How are you helping me? 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) How are you helping me? Huh? Look at me. How are you helping me? You come in here, and you're a weight on me. Do you understand me? You're a burden. You're just fucking dragging me down. You can't even clean up after yourself. Stop playing the victim. 
 I'm not playing the fucking victim. If I left now, I'd never hear from you again. 
 SISSY (CONT'D) Don't you think that's sad? Don't you think that's sad? You're my brother. 
 Why is it always so dramatic with you? Everything is always the end of the world. 
 It's not fucking dramatic. I'm trying to talk to you! 
 I don't want to talk. Try not talking. Try just listening or thinking for a change. 
 Yeah, `cos that's working great for you. You're completely fine. 75. 
 Well, I've got my own fucking apartment. 
 Oh, whopee-fucking-shit. You have your own apartment, that's amazing. Your job and an apartment, I should be in awe of you. 
 Well, at least I'm responsible for it. At least I don't depend on people all the time. You know, you're a dependency, you're a parasite. 
 You don't have anybody. You don't have anybody. You have me and your fucking pervert boss. 
 You slept with that fucking pervert boss. So what does that make you? 
 DOn't talk to me about sex-life Brandon. Not from you. 
 Whatever. 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) I'm going out. 
 Great. And then you'll just come back and we'll just have this same fucking conversation again. 
 No, you'll move out. 
 And then I'll never hear from you again? 
 Hey. 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) (close to) You want to get out of here? 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) I could take you somewhere. 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) What? Are you with someone? Does he go down on you? I do..That's what I like to do.. 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) I like the way it feels. I like the way it's just me and it... I wanna taste you. I like to slip my tongue inside you- 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) ...just as you come. 77. 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) Want me to make you come? 
 BRANDON (CONT'D) I can do that. Want me to do that?

 Which brings us on to Dental Insurance. Generally speaking, when you receive care from a participating PDP dentist, your out- of-pocket expenses will typically be lower than if your were to accept care from a dentist outside the group. The law deems it illegal for dentists to charge any more than the network approves... But listen, in my three and a half years of experience in this business people mainly care about keeping their premiums low. So, each of you must be prepared to sell the network to your clients and always cater to their specific condition. 
 (To himself) Where's everybody? 
 Mr. Brown. You scared me! 
 Mavis. Where's everybody at? I got a meetin' this mornin'. 
 It's Sunday, Mr. Brown. 
 No, it's Tuesday, Mavis. 
 Now, understand that not all people have the same type of needs. When it comes to an insurance plan everyone is different. (MORE) 3 
 OK Stop. Sir. Stop. Who been in there? 
 Excuse me? 
 I own this building, someone has been in there used my commode. Now who was it? 
 Sorry. We're actually renting this part of the building today, and we're in the middle of a seminar. 
 I don't care if you're in the middle of a heart attack son. Someone been in there, I hear the chain flush, I can smell it. Now who it was? 
 It is. It's fuckin' him. 
 Something funny? 
 No, sir. 
 Then why you cats laughing? 
 I wasn't laughing. It wasn't me. 4 
 Look, I suggest we just continue... OK. So. How does the program work? Initially, participating dentists undergo an extensive credentialing process which, if approved, allows customers to pay the minimum deductible allowed and the remainder is insured. But with non- participating dentists the cost per visit is much higher and comes completely out of pocket. So some people may want a high deductible because they have more to cover, but most common folks simply want the lowest possible plan... and remember our key takeaway!? 
. 
 OK listen up people. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Being it's Sunday and all I'm gone ask each of you to imagine you're sittin' in church right now. While today's sermon may be good they's something else on your mind. You realize you gotta take a shit. (MORE) 5 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Real bad. And you don't want to shit at the church house, naw sir. So you just sit there and think about getting home to your own toilet in your own master bath on Beech Island, South Carolina. I gotta a bidet in my master bath. Love my bidet. And a big pretty oval tub too. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) You got a bidet, Sir? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) You? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Well you gotta get you one. You all gotta get you a bidet. Are y'all sure its really Sunday today? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) What was just saying... Oh, that's right. Yes! You gotta take shit. So, after church, you speed back home and you run like hell to the house scared you ain't gonna make it. But you do. Now imagine unhitching your pants as your open your bathroom door. And then you see me. James Brown. Sittin' on your master toilet taking a break. What would you do? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) (sotto) Good God. Tear up the devil. I'm gone have to get that fixed. 6 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Now I'm a busy man, and I'm guessin' you cats are too. But someone has abused a personal convenience. Now I ask you nicely. I'm gone ask you again. Which one of you gentlefolk hung a number two in my commode? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Was it you, Sir? Was it you?! 
 Don't shoot. 
 I ain't gone shoot nobody, son. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Ma'am, it was you wasn't it? You took a break in my bathroom, didn't you? 
 Yes sir, Mister Brown. 
 Yes you did. Now, don't cry. It's gone be okay. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) You had to use the toilet. You saw an opportunity and you took it. Yeah, I got mad but, Lady, you did right by yourself. I've spent my whole life doing right by myself. I'm James Brown and I made a difference. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) You cats may not own my records but you can bet every record you have got a piece of me in `em. Ain't nobody singing today that ain't been touched by James Brown. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) So, Lady, you did right by yourself. And there ain't no other way to live. You understand me? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) You understand me? 
 Don't hurt me. Don't stop me. Don't stop me. 
 Don't stop me. Don't stop me. 
 C'mon. C'mon.

 The Rolling Stones, huh? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Then why we here, Bobby?

 You're here because they want you here, James. You're James Brown! I want you here. Because this isn't the chitlin' circuit man. We're done with that shit. This is an audience full of white faces and you're gonna make them love you. You're just not closing the show. 
 This don't matter, James. 22 
 The Rolling Stones ain't even had a hit record here. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) They ain't even ever played in America. Have they? 
 They're just kids. In a year from now we won't even know who they are. It's business, James. 
 And it's my business to hear what they got to say about this. 
 James, don't... 
. 
 Fellas, how ya doin'. Mr. Jagger. Mr. Richard. Hear you boys are closing the show. Did you know that? 
 Uh..That's what they're saying. Yeah. They just told us. 
 Uh-hmm. Well, I was told I'm closing the show. That's why I flew out here. 
 Listen man. We're filming a movie here today. This isn't live. 
 I know that. 
 What I mean is, the order in which we play makes no difference. They're going to edit and arrange the show any way they want later. 
 Y'all have a great show, fellas. 
 I'll be on stage in five. They better be ready. And the white people. 
 Yes Sir, Mr. Brown. 
 You got your high-heel sneakers on- 
 JAMES (CONT'D) You know you out of sight- 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Say I...I...I...I love you so! 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Welcome to America. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) The British Invasion make a man strong. Make him stand up. You ain't never been down how ya gonna get on up? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I can't never quit cause it get hard. You quit, you going backwards. You going backwards, you dead. So, I take it. But I take it and flip it. I go forward. And I live. 
 You leavin' you take your child, girl. You his momma. I don't need no hungry child. 
 You keep him. You can feed him. I can't. (She holds him, kisses him) Bye, baby. You be good. She leaves. Joe calls after her. 
 That's right. Why don't you go try to sell your ass on Twigg Street. That's right. Buy yourself a dress. Maybe I pay you a visit. 
 Be back in a week or so. Mind you don't makes no mess. 
 (Chuckling) Look at you boy. You go clean yourself up `fore you come in here. 
 Quit that. Driving me crazy. 
 Keep singin'. (James taps the stick quieter. (Staring at his father.) "No more my Lord" 
 I said stop! 
 (O.C.) Stop crying. I said stop crying. 
 I feel good! And I knew that I would now... 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I feel nice. Like sugar and spice. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Take it and flip it. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I feel good and I knew that I would now. So good. So good. Cause I got you. 
 That was great James. 
 Wow, James. You've got some groovy moves my friend. 
 Thank you, Mr. Avalon.   And please call me, Mr. Brown 30 
 Get up, James. 
 How many times have I done this split Bobby? 
 A thousand, maybe five thousand. 
 Exactly, and now the first and only time I rip my pants has to be in front of all those white people. 
 In white boy sweater. 
 My trumpet, bass, and drums are spread out all over this cold floor. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Go get my towel! 
 You got it boss. 
 (O.S.) I'm seventeen... 
 Know what that means,   Big Junior? Means they can try me   in Superior Court. Means they can   send my juvenile ass down for   a man's term. 3 maybe 4 years. 
 You reach my daddy? 
 I know he's in the Army. So you gotta go find him. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) What'd Aunt Honey say? 
 Go find my daddy, Big. Please! Okay? 
 So, he knows I'm here? 
 Don't cry Junior. Don't cry now. 
 (O.S.) And you were thinking of this as a profession... 
 So you want to be a singer? 
 Oh no Sir. Truth is I ain't really into all that so much. Not no more. 
 But the other boys, they call you Music-box. 
 It's just a old nickname is all. I'm looking for something stable. Steady. I want to be a Mechanic. 
 So first a singer and now a Mechanic? 
 Yes Sir. There's a fella I know back in Augusta, he owns a garage, he said he could find me a job if- 
 You can't go back to Augusta. In the event of parole, the Court in Augusta ruled you not be allowed to set foot in Richmond County til the full term of your sentence. 
 WARDEN (CONT'D) Do you know anyone outside Augusta who could act as your parole sponsor? Any family? Associates? Is there anywhere else you could go? 34 
 We the Gospel Starlighters, from right here in Toccoa. Three Four.. 
 You eyeballin' me, Music-Box? 
 What happened to you? 
 Someone threw something. 35 
 Gee, that's too bad. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Walk in the jungle sometimes you get bit by a snake. 
 (Deadpan) I'll try an' remember that. 
 Say. What's that song you done? 
 We only done half of it. "Mary Don't You Weep" is an old gospel, man. You ain't heard that before? Everybody be doin' it. 
 I ain't heard nothing since my radio got busted. That's a cool song bro'. You sung it great. That sounded real sweet. 
 Crowd sure went crazy. (James smiles. Then:) You like music? 
 Only thing keeps me sane in here. 
 How long you in for? 
 Five to thirteen years. 
 What did you do? 
 Robbed a suit. 
 They give you five to thirteen for... (Shakes his head) That's time man. 
 Tell me about it. 
 You get parole? 
 Board say I need a permanent family address and a job. But see I don't know no folks here. 
 Where yo' folks at? 
 My Daddy's in the army. And my momma... well, she left. 
 Sorry to hear that. 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) Seriously. You think I sung it good? 
 You got that swing feel. Hittin' it late. Buh, dum, Bop. That's what a song need. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) See without that feel, song just sit there. Don't move. You gotta fill it with something. You know what I'm sayin'? 37 
 (O.S.) He can do Roy Brown and The Dominoes and Louis Jordan and and... 
 -you should hear'm holler momma! You ain't heard nothing LIKE IT. He sings every day in chapel. He's a very, very religious boy Momma. He could sing in St. Stephens! 
 MRS. BYRD Bobby. We got us enough mouths to feed an' enough butts to clothe. (Yelling out the door) Daryl! Sarah! Get down here! 
 He sings every day in chapel. He's a very, very religious boy Momma. He could sing in St. Stephens! Since Old Henry passed you been shy a baritone...he a showstopper. Momma? This is it. It's like a miracle. This is what Jesus wants! 
 MRS. BYRD Jesus speak to Bobby Byrd now. He tell you that himself? 38 
 Momma, he could be in there another ten year just `cause he got no folks. He got no-one. 
 MRS. BYRD Bobby. The answer is NO. Now, go on outta here and get cleaned up. 
 What's that thing you always told me, since I was real small. About Mercy. What's that saying momma? That thing you always say? 
 MRS. BYRD Like I always say. (Sighs) "Its a sin to stand in Mercy's way". 
 Thank you, Mrs Byrd. 
 So what you in the pokey for? 
 Grandpa- 
 (to Bobby) You know how would have felt you bringing this boy over here? 39 
 Big momma married you and you were in the pokey before. 
 MRS. BYRD Bobby Byrd! 
 (to Bobby) If I'm going to be forced to have a jailbird in my house I at least like to know what I'm dealing with. 
 Grandpa- 
 No. He got a right to ask. I am a jailbird. I've done wrong and I gotta own up to that. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I stole a man's three piece suit. You want to know me? I tell ya. My daddy is in the army. My momma left when I was five. I'm skinny but I'm strong. I can read a little bit and I like to sing. That's who's sittin' here. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) And I think God knew that when I took that suit that I might end up with you. I ain't never sat at a table with such a fine group of people in my life. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I used to wish I could put that suit back, but now I'm here with y'all. Fried chicken. Green beans. Corn bread. Those nice curtains. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) A house smells good. I'm happy I stole that suit. And I thank you for having me here. 
 Boy, pass them beans before you get your bullshit all over them. 
 MRS. BYRD (Changing subject) James is going to sing with us in church this Sunday Sarah. 
 Really. Well maybe we could work up a little harmony together. 
 Jailbird! 
 There's coffee in the kitchen, Nafloyd. Make yourselves at home. (Calls) James! 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) James. Come meet the band. 
 MRS. BYRD Sarah! I ain't tellin' you again. Get down here. 
 She's coming, Momma. She's coming. 
 MRS. BYRD Sarah! 
 Go fix Nafloyd and the boys some coffee. We got guests, Momma. 
 MRS. BYRD Nafloyd?! Where you boys at? 42 
 Pack up. We leaving. 
 You miss your momma, boy? 
 
 ..S'much appreciated Honey. Sure is mighty kind.. 
 What the hell am I supposed to do with that donkey, Joe? 
 Thought you could sell it. 
 I don't sell donkey, Joe. And Jumpin' in the Army ain't gone make this boy go away. 
 (to James) Look after yourself Junior. 
 Everybody gotta be somewhere. What's your name, sugar? 
 Junior. 
 Guess you Little Junior now. 44 
 I do this... (BJ touches his hat) You say `Pretty girls', unnerstand? So when they come, you be ready, alright? I'll say- Yessir, yessir, come on down the street-we got sweet whiskey, we got music- (touches his hat) 
 Pretty girls. 
 We got cards, we got dice, dancing- (touches his hat again) 
 Pretty girls. 
 You done good Little Junior. You the sweetest little boy in the world. Hear me? 
 I don't know, James.   This don't look too gospel. 
 What you talkin' about? Your hair is rising up to the Lord right? Like a flame. 
 The flames of hell. We're the Gospel Starlighters. We a gospel group. This is R & B hair. 46 
 What you think "Caldonia" is, Nafloyd. 
 (Ruffled) We just playin' around with "Caldonia" when we practicing. That don't make us R & B. We still Gospel. 
 I swear he's gonna break that piano. 
 We'll be back in ten to flip you again! Whoooo! Yeah! 
 (Frustrated) Look at these people James. Man! I'm ready. You know'm saying? When it gone be us up there? 
 Now. 
 What? 
 There's a piano. And a stage. And right now. (Looks at it) Ain't no one on it. 47 
 What you talking about? We can't go up there. 
 Why not? Like you said, Nafloyd, "We just playin' around with "Caldonia". So let's go play around. 
 We're the Star- 
 We're the Famous Flames. 
 Flames? 
 Famous? 
 What is that? 
 We the Flames. 
 (Deadpan) Just keepin' it warm for ya. 
 Hey. What's your name? 
 The Famous Flames. 
 No. What's your name? 
 I play a show in Lafayette last week twenty thirty girls pass clean out. Need oxygen. I'm killing `em James. They should lock me away. I cut loose it's like a spaceship land. Did I say I got a record out? They drop it five times a day on WIBB. Five times a day. (He looks at James) And I'm flippin' burgers. You know why? (MORE) 49 
 So how we catch the wind? 
 Sugar, may I borrow your pencil? 
 No. 
 Rob a liquor store. You take a hundred bucks to WIBB in Macon. Ask for Big Sauk. Say Richard sent you. You make an acetate. Ten copies. You send them to these people. 
 It's that easy why don' you do it? 
 I already did. Baby, this is the last time you're gone see my beautiful ass 'cep on TV. Six months the whole world gone know me. I gone be bigger than Cleopatra. It's written in the stars James. Yes Sir. I'm gone have the world on a string. (Then) And that's when the trouble start. 
 And why that. 
 That when the Devil come. And he ain't gonna be red with no fiery tail. He gone be white. In a fancy suit. And he gone look you in the eye and he gonna ask what you want. And you best not shake, nor tremble. You best not blink one eye. 
 You tell me Richard. You tell me what you see. 
 What happen to you? 
 Do you love him?! 
 Bobby. I can't make practice Thursday. I gotta get married. 53 
 (Whispers) What are you talkin' about? Who you marryin'? 
 That chick I met after the Stone Mountain Show. Velma. 
 What about my sister? 
 Oh, I'll still harmonize with Sarah from time to time. 
 I ain't playin', James. How you gone do all this? 
 Do all what? 
 Practice. The road. Makin' records. Startin' a family. 
 I ain't startin' nothin', Bobby. Except what we doin'. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) That us. We in there Bobby. 
 That's all the money we got. And some we don't. 
 But, it is beautiful. All those little grooves. That's us. It's been written. (MORE) 54 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Now, men gone lay with women. That's nature. But a woman ain't never gone stop a real man from what he's supposed to do. That's God. Husband? Daddy? That gives a man purpose. Man gotta have purpose. But purpose don't stop me neither, Bobby. Ain't nothin' gone stop us. Nothin'. And that's God too. 
 You gone smile for me, Teddy Brown? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Come on, boy. 
 We out of greens. You want me to go pick some up? 
 No baby. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Baby. I gotta go. 
 But I got your supper. 
 VELMA (CONT'D) Wake me up. 
 (shouts out) I got you right in here, Teddy Brown. 
 Nafloyd, you know in "Let's Make It" when it goes (he hums). If you go up there and hold it, like. (hums). It's gone be sweet. Make it like you got a harmonica stuck in your throat. 
 You know what? Why don't you sing it, James? 
 What? I can't sing it. It's your song man. 
 But I ain't singing it right James. I just ain't. (MORE) 56 
 James ain't saying that `floyd. He's just hearing something. Get back to pushing the car. 
 Let's all take a break for a minute. 
 What I say in Peterstown? Huh? 
 I know what you said. 
 What I say? 
 You said `Fill her up Floyd. 
 That's right. That's what he said. 
 I know you he said fill her up, Baby Roy! Problem is we don't got the dough to fill it. (to Bobby) We don't got the dough because Bobby here let James spend all our money on some fake record which is right now sittin' in trash cans outside King, outside RCA, outside Chess. (to James) You took all our money, James. Where my money at? 
 Cool it Floyd! 
 Where my money, James?! 
 I'm taking you to the money, Nafloyd. (James tap his head) Right now. 
 So, push the Wagon, Nafloyd. 
 Are you sure, Baby? 
 The Tuxedo Room already cancelled tonight's show. Said if we couldn't show up last night then why we gonna show up tonight. 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) Now we got twenty four hours to get to Prestonville. Hundred and forty miles West. We got no gas. No bread. No show. I miss anything? 58 
 Velma's pregnant again. 
 Congratulations. 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) So now, we gotta make us a business decision. 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) Thirty cents. The question is, do I call the Two Spot, find out we got any messages. Or do I get me a coffee. Or do I skip the coffee, and get me a donut. 
 Knock yourself out. 
 Hey honey. Can I get me a coffee... 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) ..and...let's see...a donut? 
 You boys from outta town? 
 We're Musicians. We the Famous Flames. 
 Flames? (noting their disheveled look) More like a flicker. 
 All we need is a spark, baby. So we can turn the lamp down low till this sun rise up on us in the morning. 
 Y'all's broke ass is splittin' that donut, ain't you? 
 WAITRESS (CONT'D) I'll bring it with a knife. 
 I gone call the Two Spot. 
 Oh no. 
 What? 
 Excuse me ma'am, I just came from a place called the Tuxedo Room. I'm looking for the boys who were supposed to be playing there tonight? 
 (whispering) I ain't supposed to leave Bibb County without telling my parole officer. 
 Shit James! What we do? 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) He's coming this way. Oh shit. 
 I can't go back to prison Bobby. 
 I've been driving across over two states looking for these boys. They have to be here in Macon. Tell ya what, I'll make it worth your while if you can tell me where they are. 
 King Records? What did they do? 
 Everything right. 
 (pole-axed) King records? 
 Evening, Sir. I'm Bobby Byrd this is my associate James Brown. 
 Hi. 
 I understand you're looking for the Famous Flames. 
 I'm Ralph Bass from Federal records in Cincinnati. An imprint of King Records. I heard your acetate. I want you to come to Cincinnati. I want you to make a record for King. 61 
 King records. As in King Records. The King records. 
 You sure put a lot into that cut. The main vocal. You got some soul right there. 
 Uh.. That's not me. That's uh. That's James. 
 That you singing? 
 Yeah. That's me. 
 Please, Please, Please....! 
 Wait...wait a second here- 
 What we stop for? That was cookin'. 
 It's OK sir we OK. We can just start right at the top. 
 It ain't right. It's too slow.     We gotta pick up the pace fellas. 
 What are you doing, James? These men been doing this for a long time. We need to listen to them. 
 I need to come in early..push it. Drive it. Early. Before the beat. Then speed it up, man. 
 James, this is a ballad. The pace we've set is perfect. 
 I know it's a ballad, Mr. Bass. But a ballad is supposed to get her in the mood, not put her to sleep. 
 Let's just get it done OK? 
 But it ain't right. 
 (Takes off cans. Yells) What the hell is this Ralph?! Where's the rest of the song? 
 Syd- 
 He just keeps hollering that one word over and over. "Please". "Please" what, Ralph?! Please jerk my dick? What the hell does he want? If he doesn't tell me, you're fired. 
 Listen, Mr. Nathan. This song- 
 I don't hear a song Ralph. A song has verses. A snappy chorus. It's not just some unfortunate nigger pleading. Who needs that? Give me the fucking song Ralph. The song. 
 It's not about the song. 
 What? 
 It's not the song. 
 Please!   Please!   Please. 
 James Brown, James Brown, James Brown. 
 Please!   Please!   Please! 
 James. I want you to meet somebody. 
 RALPH (CONT'D) James, this is Ben Bart. Ben is President of Universal Attractions. New York's biggest booking agency. 
 That was a great show last week over in Jersey. 
 Well thank you Sir, we worked real hard to- 
 Not we James. Not the Famous Flames. You. James Brown. 
 What Bart is saying James is- 
 I know what Mr. Bart is saying. I heard him. Loud and clear. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I see where we goin'. Saw it this morning when your secretary called ask me to come here an hour early. Alone. I knew it six months ago. Hell, I knew it the day I was born. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) There's some things I'm gonna want. 
 Come in Boys. Come in. 
 I don't understand. Is this some sort of mistake? 
 (Reads) His Famous Flames? 
 Sir, this ain't right. 
 We agree. See I believe it should say simply James Brown. The fact is Gentlemen, James Brown doesn't need the Famous Flames. King records and Universal don't need the Famous Flames. But James has requested that the name remain in some form. Now if you want to stay, stay, but from now on you work for James Brown, on James Brown's records. Should you find this disagreeable in part or whole, you can go home. 
 (Stunned) James? 
 Bobby. It's just a name. Ain't nothing different between us. This for all us not just me. It's gone be good. 
 James Brown. I never liked you. Come on. Let's get outta here.. 67 
 
 So. Do you know what you want James? 
 (Incredulous) I know exactly what I want. 
 Forget it. King doesn't make live albums. They're too expensive. 
 I think a live album- 
 James, your audience is Negro. Negroes don't buy albums. They don't have the resources. Especially not for a bunch a songs they already got. 
 James, Recording live is five, six times as expensive as the studio. And that's for some violin concerto at the Met. No one jumps up and shouts "Blow it fucker!" in the middle of The Magic Flute. 
 But, Pop, you know my show. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Mr. Nathan, you ain't ever even seen the show. My show. 
 Don't need to. 
 Mr. Nathan- 
 JAMES (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
 The "Mashed Potato". 
 That ain't the "Mashed Potato". 
 Exactly. 
 SYD (CONT'D) I can't do the "Mashed Potato". That's your job. That's the show. But what I can do is the business. 
 So I stick to what I know. You stick to what you know. And that's the showbusiness. 
 Book the Apollo. I'm gonna spend my own money on this. Syd Nathan's wrong. 
 I'm not going to let you do that, Jimmy. 69 
 Book it out next week for the whole week, go in, we drill it, we drill it, we drill it, then we drop it. 
 Forget it, Jimmy. It's too big of a risk. Let's order something to eat. 
 I don't understand risk? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I don't understand cos I'm just the "show"? Is that all I am to you, Pop? The show? The money? 
 Of course not, Jimmy. 
 Sure it is. That's all me and my black brothers are to the "White Devil". We the show and you the money. And that's how the White Devil keeps it all. 
 I'm not the "White Devil". I'm trying to protect you. I'm doing my job. 
 Pop, look me in the eye. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Pop. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Yeah, I'm the show. But, if I'm spendin' my own money on the show, then I'm gone be the business too. (MORE) 70 
 JAMES (CONT'D) And after we kill The Apollo, I'll kick over a few bucks to the white devil. Whatever I think he deserves. And If I'm payin' you, Pop, you gone show me how to do it. 
 I'll call Nola Sound. They got these new three track stereo recorders from Ampex. 
 And I want the best engineer in town. I don't care what it takes. I don't care what it cost. I want everyone in uniform, the ushers, front of house, the peanut peddlers. 
 We'll need the band in New York immediately. 
 And I want `em in Sapphire blue suits. Pop. Sapphire. 
 Sapphire Blue. Underwear too. How does that sound? 
 It's cold. It's cold. It's too cold man. It's too cold. Cold. Cold. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. 
 Evening, Mr. Brown. Cold out tonight. 
 Gertrude. See if you can get some coffee for the folks in line. 
. 
 You ready Mr. Byrd? 
 (Ice cool) Ready Mr. Brown. 
 V/O Are you ready for star time? Thank you and thank you very kindly- 72 
 We got the level on his main mic way up to drown out the crowd. You gotta get him to hold back a little in the first number! 
 I think its too late for that. You ain't got a breeze, Syd. You got a hurricane. 
 Watch me. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) You know I feel alright. (Yeah!) You know I feel alright children. (Yeah!) I feel aaaaaaaallllriiiiiiight. 
 Think...Think...Think...About your bad self... 
 Thank you. That's very kind of you. 
 Gertrude. Get everybody out. 
 What? 
 We gone celebrate tonight. And then tomorrow we gone Wilmington and do it to it all over again. 74 
 Mr. Brown. Excuse me. Mr. Brown. (Then) ...James. 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) There's a woman here, Mr. Brown. She says she's your mother. 
 Momma? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Momma it's me. It's me. 
 You know this little nigger? 
 SOLDIER (CONT'D) Beat it. 
 But Momma! 
 Get the fuck out of here. 
 Don't cry, Little Junior. Don't cry. Now, child, I want you to listen to me. You gone be okay. You hear me? Little Junior, you were born dead. Did you know that? 
 Who's this? 
 (quietly) James gone wear that seat out. 
 Which seat. Her's or the bus? 76 
 I'm Yvonne! I'm a singer. Let me worry about my seat. 
 Compliments of Universal Attractions. 
 This for me? Looky this! We got us a chauffeur. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) (to the chauffeur) Gimme the keys. What they payin' you? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) This here's a month's pay, help you get yourself another job. I gone drive myself. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Don't mention it. (turns to Ben Bart) That's six a month goin' somewhere else. 
 Pop, see there's something I been meaning to ask you. 
 What's that Jimmy. 
 I got a seventh grade education Pop, so you'll have to excuse me. I was looking over those figures you sent me, and something occur to me: we don't pay the promoter, the promoter pay us. 
 Just standard Jimmy. Guarantee against fluctuating ticket sales. Lets plan a- 
 -sure we planning, see I ask myself, what if we don't got fluctuating sales. What if you knocking the tar out of every show. 
 Well let me explain the way it works. When you book a show. Take Chicago. Now our promoter in Chicago is- 
 BART (CONT'D) Lenny J Frank. Lenny's the number one promoter in Chicago has been for twenty years. 
 I don't doubt it. 
 Now when Lenny pays us a flat rate, we can account. You know, number one, you're getting top rate and number two- 
 What if we took the gate? (Bart stops looks over) What if we took it ourself. (MORE) 78 
 JAMES (CONT'D) And still got the show promoted, but better. 
 Better than Lenny Franks? 
 Lenny Franks a James Brown fan? How old he, sixty? Why's he gone try harder for James Brown than for Sam Cooke? Or Ray Charles. Or Tom Jones. See Pop. We go to the radio stations. 
 Jimmy, I understand your frustration but you gotta realize you're entering a game where the rules are set out. If you were a ball player you can't walk in and change how many innings they're gonna play just because... 
 You see my point right? OK. Listen up. We go to the radio station. We go to the young cats. The hungry cats. The late night cat. 
 The twenty year old white deejay in Richmond Virginia who's getting paid nothing and is only doin' it because he loves music. We go to him we ask him if he want to be the sole James Brown promoter for the Richmond show. For a percentage. He gone say: 
 Between nothing and fifty bucks a week. But he love my music. He digs James Brown. And he got a microphone and a turn-table and four hours airtime to kill. 
 And at the end he gone say.. 
 Now because he's twenty he's got strong legs. And he knows everyone. 
 (V.O.) He know the guy in the barber shop knows the guy at the pool hall, the guy at the garage. 80 
 (to us) That way we get our record played outside Payola, we get our show promoted better, harder, cheaper, and we keep the gate. 
 (to Bart) And the best part is, you can put it all through the books. Item. Promoter. (He turns to Bart) What'd you think Pop? 
 Its beautiful Jimmy. I can't do it. 
 Why not? 
 Universal Attractions promotes many acts. I can't piss off the 60 or 70 promoters in this country to skim a little extra on the James Brown Show. 
 It's not a little. If the show sells, and it's sellin', we talking thousands of dollars a night. Difference per year between 2 and 3 million dollars. 
 And I'm out of a job. Think you're forgetting I don't just work for James Brown. 
 And there's my next point Pop. Why not? (Bart stops) (MORE) 81 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I can do something for you, and you can do something for me, and it ain't buy me no Cadillac. Did you buy Wilson Pickett a Cadillac? Did you buy Jackie Wilson a Cadillac? You know which way this thing is going Pop. I got people around me who don't see it. 
 (to James) I thank you for the fish. And I'm gonna need some benefits, boss. 
 Po-lice have the same problem. 
 Who you play Sax with son? 
 What's the rule? 
 Not on the bus. Not backstage. You a talented horn player, son. You gotta keep your game tight. Now you wanna smoke a little groove on your own time, that's yo' business. But we out here to work hard and we gone do just that you dig? Fifty. 83 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Hello pretty thing. You want an autograph? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) You want to come with me? So I can sign it somewhere private? 
 I called you yesterday, you ain't home. 
 I was home all day. 
 You were home all day. So why you didn't pick up the phone? 
 I don't know. What time you call? 
 I call you at one and quarter past one, then I call you at two. And I call again at three. 
 You must've wanted to talk to me pretty bad. 
 Where were you? 84 
 Yesterday. I don't know..in the bath? 
 For two hours? 
 You want me to take shorter baths? You don't have a phone in the bathroom, James. What you gonna do? Fine me? 
 I ain't gone fine you, baby.   You fine enough already. 
 Then get over here, Mr. Dynamite. 
 Got you a phone in the bathroom now. 
 Keep your eyes closed Bobby. Keep `em closed. 
 They're closed, Dede. 
 You peekin' brother? OK. OK. (James stops the car.) You ready. You ready? OK. Open `em. (Bobby does. ) Check it Bobby. Is that something? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) That something Bobby? Is that something? 
 Yeah brother. That's something. 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) Hey Velma. 
 Hey Bobby. 
 VELMA (CONT'D) Teddy got impetigo. 
 Impetigo? 
 It's a skin infection. 86 
 All that mess round his mouth. That's impetigo. It's highly infectious. 
 VELMA (CONT'D) I'm just sayin' Mrs. Brown, I wouldn't go too near Teddy. Not unless you wanna catch impetigo. 
 Thank you, Velma. I'll consider myself warned. 
 Warned? Oh, that's a whole other conversation. Welcome to the family. 
 Listen up. Which one of you cats want to fly to Reno on daddy's airplane? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) (to Velma) You need anything? 
 I'll let you know. I'm putting a big list together right now. 
 Welcome to Reno, Mr. Brown. What exactly do you call your style of music? 
 I call it James Brown music. What I mean is, it's so far ahead of it's time that they ain't got a name for it yet. Take another record, any record from your stack at home. I don't care if it's from Motown or Stax or whatever...and put it on your box. None of them are gonna sound like mine. Not even my own old records. Just like the title says, it's a "new bag". See the funk is in the bass. The bass never changes. It's a groove, lady. Soon as you hear that groove, I know I got you. 
 And what exactly is the groove? 
 The groove is something you feel. The groove is solid. Bam Bap. It don't move. It's like a heartbeat. It's inside you, driving everything. Hard. Flat. A groove. 
 But how exactly do you define it? 
 I just did. (Then) See Miss. See there's some things, they're just too big to fit in a magazine. But we all feel it. Even little Teddy here know it when he feel it. 
 "Um Booga Chooca" 88 
 See. Right there. We all feel it together. And that's the groove. Understand? 
 (Checks her questions) So what's your favorite food? 
 Then we got a day between Raleigh, Carolina and Columbia two days after. 
 Day off? 
 Sure. Regroup. Rest the horses. 
 We ain't payin' the horses to rest `em. Besides, we got a day off in two weeks in New Orleans. The boys can get their wives, girlfriends along, kick back. What's between Raleigh and Columbia? Spartanburg? 
 Well see, James started out in Augusta. Then his family moved to Toccoa. That's where we met. 
 And tell me about James' first band, the Famous Flames. 89 
 Well there was five of us to start with. Nafloyd Scott, Baby Roy Scott, Sylvester Keels.. 
 And they left... 
 Yeah. They left. 
 (interrupting) Bobby? What's the name of the theater in Spartanburg... 
 Uh.. The Viceroy. The.. 
 The Regal! 
 Yeah. That's it. The Regal. 
 (to Bart) On Howard Street and main. Hold about 750 people. Guy named Bennett used to own it. Yeah, Spartanburg. Yeah, we'll play there and I can bring in my masseuse from Anderson. 
 JAMES (O.C.) (CONT'D) Call `em up, Pop. 
 Wow. He's got an amazing memory. 
 Yeah. James remembers everything. 90 
 Hey little man, you been good this year. 
 Yes, Mister Brown. 
 Merry Christmas, Little Man. 
. 
 Great crowd today, Baby. 91 
 DEDE (CONT'D) You want some dinner? 
 (O.C.) You stand up in James Brown's yard dressed like that? So every man can see you? 
 JAMES (O.C.) (CONT'D) Cover yourself up. 
 (regarding the manager) Honey, his hands are tied. The pool area has been reserved for a private function. 
 We're good people and we've paid good money. We didn't come all the way to New Orleans to swim in a pool full of- 
 
 WIFE (CONT'D) Niggers.                          Entertainers. 
. 
 You a bad man Bobby Byrd. 
 Fella's this is Fred. I thought we'd show him how things work? 
 Means less sharp. Bring it down. 
 Mean I give it some heat. 
 What about when he do this..? 
 That'll be ten thousand dollars. 
 When? 
 Now.    We gotta go get dressed. 
 You're kidding. Tell me you kidding. 
 See My great grandmother on my momma's side, she Asian. She got Asian blood. See Asians are a flexible race. You get with an Asian chick? That a whole other story. No spank but they got it baby they got it. Anyway what was I talkin `bout? 
 Your Chinese knees Mr. Brown. 
 That's right. That it. I got these Chinese knees. (MORE) 95 
 JAMES (CONT'D) That's how come I can dance the way I do. Anyway. One. Two. Three. Four. Hit it. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Stop. Maceo. (Laughs) What you doing man? You coming in maybe a little too late. What's the matter son. You lost your feeling? 
 (Flatly) No Sir. I ain't lost no feeling. 
 (Innocently) Something wrong, Maceo? (SILENCE. Directly) Is something wrong, Maceo? 
 James- 
 You got something to say Mr. Byrd? (Silence. Smiling) Because a man got something to say he should say it. You got something to say? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) (Shouting) Well then you just HOLDING UP THE REHEARSAL Mr. Byrd. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I can't have people HOLDING UP THE REHEARSAL. If I can't do it right I ain't gone do it at all. We got to GET ON. GET AHEAD. Now you know the rule. (MORE) 96 
 JAMES (CONT'D) You late, you off or you hold us up, it's no good, Mr. Byrd. Its gonna cost you 50 dollars. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Now are you ready Mr. Byrd. Are you ready Mr. Byrd? 
 Yes, Mr. Brown. 
 Good. I ain't fattening frogs for snakes. From the top. One Two... 
 Quit it. (They all stop) Clyde man. Lets get that POP! Dee.. app..POP! Unnerstand? It drop before you reach the beat. Dig? 
 (Whispers to Waymon) Does he mean top of the bar? 
 (To Maceo) He means the down beat. 
 It goin' wrong there Pee Wee, when it rise up. 
 But Mr. Brown. 
 MACEO (CONT'D) We rehearsed it like you told us. We got it like you like it. Jimmy can't do that with the part he's playing. We can change the part if you want. 
 (Suddenly angry) Did I say change the part? Don't change the part. How many records you got? 
 Thank you! I like the part he playin' now. I just want it in a different place. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) What's this, Maceo. 
. It's a snare, Mr. Brown. 
 A snare what? 
. Drum. 
 Correct. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) What's this, Maceo? 
 Guitar, Mr. Brown. 
 No it's not. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) What's that, Pee Wee? 98 
. A drum, Mr. Brown? 
 Now you're getting it. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) What's that he's holding. 
 A drum? 
 You Fellas. What are those shiny things you holding. 
 Now we all got our drums. Now when you're playing the drum it don't matter what key you're in, what bar your in or what planet you on. Dig? 
 (With trepidation) But Mr. Brown. 
 MACEO (CONT'D) Clyde'll be in a different time to the rest of the band. That doesn't work musically. 
 But does it sound good? 
 Mmmn! Huh! Now that a groove. 
 Bobby, James Brown's my meal ticket. So I just shut my ears and chomp down his bullshit. But why you soak it up man? You his best friend. You know him for time brother. And he treat you like that. I was you I'd bust him in his damn mouth. 
 I hang in there cause I remember the day that I knew. Knew I was never gonna be in front. 
 You sure you just ain't too scared to be in the front? 
 No. But my ears a' open. Open your ears, Maceo. He's a genius. And he's takin' us with him. 
 Mother, she got to have. Say, you got to have a mother for me. Yeah, popcorn! 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Quit it. (They stop.) We missing something. (They look at each other. It was perfect.) (MORE) 101 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Pee Wee, get over here by the microphone. And bring that horn box. That's where you keep the wig, right? 
 Mr. Brown? 
 What is it? Why we stop Henry? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) What? What is it? 
 It's King. They shot Dr. King. 
 Jimmy, Mayor of Boston's office called. Wanted you to know they've cancelled tomorrow's show at the Garden. For reasons of public safety. He's worried about rioting. 102 
 Tell the Mayor, I sold 30 million records and ninety five percent of them are to the black community. They listen to me. They won't riot 
 We have virtual race war looming across the South, Jimmy. Politics, 101? Don't put 10,000 angry blacks together in one place in the middle of a city, and broadcast it live to the world. 
 Get the Mayor on the phone. 
 Mr. Mayor, the way I see it, you already lost your next election. You lost it at 7:05 PM Memphis time. 
 Now tomorrow night, you either got 10,000 angry folks in the Boston Garden, or you got 10,000 angry folks on your front lawn. Take your pick son. Which one you want? 
 All of us are here to night to listen to a great talent. James Brown. But we're also here to pay tribute to one of the greatest Americans, Dr. Martin Luther King. So, let us look at each other and pledge that whatever else any other community might do we in Boston will honour Dr. King in peace. 
 Brother before I get to this next thing I wanna say. He's a young man you dig. He's a young man so he's thinking together. The man is together. Give him another round of applause. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Hit it. 
 Oh no. 104 
 Wait a minute. Step off. Move off. I'll be a'ight here. I be fine. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Do you wanna dance son? You dance. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) C'mon. C'mon now. Y'all go down. Go back down. Don't nobody else come up. Wait a minute. Wait. Ladies and gentleman. This is no way. This is. We are black. We are black. (Cheers.) Wait a minute go back. Can't y'all go back down and lets do the show together. We're black don't make us all look bad. Let me finish the show. Step down there. Be a gentleman. Lets represent our own selves. Lets represent our own selves. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Now I ask the police to step back because I figure I could get some respect from my own people. Now we together ain't we. (Cheers! Screams!) Hit that thing man. 
 (to a policeman) Holy shit. He did it. 105 
 (sotto) Of course he did. 
. 
 (V.O.) In America today you've either got to be an entertainer or a ball player or what? If you poor, young and black, what is there? And you ask me why they on the street? It ain't politics we watchin'. It's economics. 
 You got kids out there that can't eat, robbing and stealing and doing what they have to do to make it. And if you don't do something about it we gonna lose the country. I go to Harlem, talk to Rap Brown, talk to the Nation they call me a separatist. Here we're on our way to the White House, Pop, and they already calling me an Uncle Tom. So what I supposed to do? (MORE) 106 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Write a check for Rap so he buy rifles, machine guns, rally on 125th and take it south? What it say to you, a street kid from Augusta, Georgia in the White House? 
 It says you kissin' up to the Man James. 
 You asking me to turn this plane around and stand up the President? 
 No. I'm saying who gives a shit. You're already screwed, James. Think about it.   If you stand up Lyndon Johnson to go kiss up to the Panthers, you ain't gone be playin' Vegas anytime soon because if they think you can stop a riot, they sure as hell will expect you to start one. 
 So here I am. Just a sorry soul brother whining inside his private jet, huh? 
 Don't be scared my friend. Because if you're scared, it doesn't end well for the black man. Do your thing, James. (He looks at him hard) It's worked for you so far. 
 I want to go to Vietnam. I want to show unity for the boys out there. The beleaguered, the tired and in the dark. (MORE) 107 
 JAMES (CONT'D) And we need to bring awareness, and Mr. President, we need to bring the super heavy funk. 
 Take it and flip it. 
 Hit it. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Quit it. (he pushes the intercom to the booth) Bring `em in. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) How we all doin'. Hope this ain't too late for you folks. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I brought you all here today so I could tell you something very important. I want you all to know that you can do or be anything you want in this world. Don't let anybody tell you anything different. You understand? When I was a boy I used to shine shoes in front of radio station. Now I own that radio station. You got to build it. And then you gotta learn it... and that's when you earn it. 
 You think they fuck up he gone take they pocket money. 
 We ready fellas? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I think about a lot of things. About problems. About solutions. You know one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got in this country...is letting a person feel that they important. Feel that they somebody. It's it. Man can't get hisself together... ...until he know who he is and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from! WHERE WE ALL 
! 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Say it loud! 
 I'm Black and I'm Proud! 
 
 You the man, Teddy Brown? 
 I'm the man, Mr. Brown. 
 Gertie. The band ready? 
 They're ready Mr. Brown. 
 Don't look like it. 
 Y'all act like y'all don't know what time it is. What you doin'? 
 I've been elected spokesman to speak on behalf of the band. 
 Spokesman? Elected? 
 We asked to get paid on time. We haven't been paid in weeks. We asked for scheduled days off. Every day off we get you make us rehearse.. We asked to get paid for recording but you included it in our salary. 
 Teddy, go on and wait outside. 
 Yes, Sir. 
 Fellas. I hear ya. I really do. And I appreciate the honesty. That can't be easy. No Sir. You got grievances. You got your own selves to think about. Hell, you're men. I dig it. 
 I don't think you understand. 
 We know you owe the government back taxes. Your restaurant, radio stations, recording studios, labels, all different businesses, Unaccounted cash passing between them. (MORE) 112 
 MACEO (CONT'D) It's a mess, Mr. Brown and if you want us to be a part of it, we gonna need our cash too. Right now. 
 MACEO (CONT'D) And most of all none of us ever want to be fined for anything ever again. 
 I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna think about it. That's all. 
. 
 (He shakes his head.) It's like I always say Bobby. You gotta know who you are. You got to know where you are in this world. Five minutes ago, those boys were the best band on the planet. Now they nothing. Now they a bunch of sidemen with their hearts beatin' fast. Maceo comin' in here talking about my taxes. All I've done for this country and they comin' after James Brown? How you gone keep everybody happy? Huh? And stay on top? You along for the ride while everything is groovy and now they gone kick me when I'm down? People either on the bus or they off it. 
 (He turns to Bobby.) Well go on. Get out of here. Y'might catch `em they gone need a singer. 
 Negro, what makes you think I'm leaving? I been here all the time, Mr. Brown. I'm still here. 
 See that's the thing about the funk. The funk don't quit. 
 Last time I checked. 
 Cause if the funk gone up'n'quit that's it. 
 That's why the funk don't quit. 
 Are we done here Mr. Byrd? 
 I'm afraid we ain't Mr. Brown. 
 Are we done? 
 I think we got more funk in the trunk. 
 That's right. Two Musketeers. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) What's those kids from Cincinnati. The New Dapps...Blackenizers? Who that kid play bass? 
 (Smiles) Bootsy. 114 
 Fancy suit bro'. 
 Backatcha slick. How you doin, Chicken? 
 Just shit my pants. 
 Easy now. Don't forget. Don't ever call him James or nothin'. He ain't no-one but Mr. Brown. 
 CATFISH                            CHICKEN Check.                             Gotcha. 
 BOOTSY (CONT'D) Good evening Mr. Brown. 
 CHICKEN                            CATFISH Mr. Brown.                         Mr. Brown.

 Can I stop you Mr. Brown. We been learning off yo' records since we was nine years old. You already taught us the songs. So with respect. We ready. Mr. Brown. 
 They say they ready Mr. Byrd. What you think? 115 
 We been waiting for this moment our entire lives, Mr. Brown. 
 How old are you son? 
 Twenty. (Then) Mr. Brown. 
 Cats know Super Bad? 
 Why won't you say it? I said it. Why won't you say it back? 
 Baby, I gotta get to my show. I can't be playin' around right now 
 I love you. 
 You know I don't drink. 
 Say it, Mr. Brown. Say you love me. 
 Happy now? 116 
 I'm pregnant. 
 Now it's true, we work hard. A man gotta work hard if he wanna break ground. And we breaking new ground everyday... 
 My record Live at the Apollo is the first R&B album in the history of the world to go top ten. Stayed up in there for 66 weeks.. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) That record come across. I mean it hit hard!!! Uhn! 
 And slowly, the whole World knew who we were. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) See in showbusiness, you got two parts. You got the show and you got the business. And brother. (Deadly serious) You better believe. You looking at both. 
 You know what I think? After we put out my next solo album, I bet I could play Paris or the Apollo. 
 How's that? 
 I was just saying when me and you put out my new record, I bet I could fill this place all myself. No problem. 
 What the hell you talking about? "Fill this place all myself"? "No problem?" You sayin' I'm slippin'? 
 No I don't think you slippin'.   You James Brown. You ain't never slippin'. I was just... 
 People copy me, Mr. Byrd. People gonna copy my moves till the earth goes dark. You understand? You think people are gonna buy that record like they buy my record? That what you sayin'? 
 No. 
 Who you been tellin' this too? You been telling that to the Apollo? 
 No, James! I haven't told nobody but you. We were just talking. (MORE) 119 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) I thought you be cool with that. You always been talking about... About... About... standin' on my own feet. 
 Bobby, how you gone stand on your own feet? You just spent twenty years gettin' fat on a man's dollar. I produce a record for you and now it's gone to your head. You go talking big behind my back. You go sneaking round, raising heat off another man's name. We here, we doing something and you making plans sucker? 
 (Shouting) I ain't told nobody or made any plans. We just talkin' about it. Now. That's it. 
 I'm ashamed of you, Bobby. And you should be ashamed of you. Now you tryin' to run around with Vicki. Don't jive yourself bro'. Now, Vicki, she could fill this place. 
 Well, Vicki ain't yours. So, Vicki and me ain't none of your damn business. 
 But she's been my business before. 
 I can't do this no more, James. 
 Damn right you can't do this no more. 120 
 I said I can't do this no more. 
 See, the funny part. You say that like it's a big thing. Like "oh my God, Bobby Byrd gone leave James Brown on his own." 
 I ain't leaving you on your own, Mr. Brown. You already on your own. Always were. 
 BOBBY (CONT'D) Is that God too? 
: 
 Bobby? Get everybody out of here and wait outside. 
 I was on the Subway last week, and the two kids next to me was arguing who was the best, James Brown or Little Willy John. And this one boy, he was saying "James Brown the best" "There ain't no one better than James Brown", he got so mad I thought he was gonna whup this other boy. And then- 
 Why tonight? (She stops, her face falls.) Why you come here? 
 Well. Sugar, I live over in Brooklyn... and you my baby and you here playin' the Apollo. 
 I don't want you to feel proud. I ain't your sugar. I ain't your baby. Not then. Not now. And I don't want you to tell anyone you my momma, because you and me know that ain't true. 
 Your daddy beat me. Beat you. I stayed because I loved you. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife. Nothin' about being a mother. I did the best I could. I did that. (MORE) 122 
 SUSIE (CONT'D) I left because I loved you. I ain't had nothing to make no other choice. I was shamed. I was. 
 See I thought about this. I know it weren't personal and that's why this ain't neither. It turned out fine. I didn't need you. I looked after James Brown. Made sure he was OK. No-one else. No-one help me. 
 I never wanted to be a momma. But I carried you, boy. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife or being a momma. But I carried you and I loved you when you were in me. I chose you. I chose you. 
 Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Clean yourself up. That's it. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) I'm James Brown. And James Brown don't need nothing. Don't need no- body. 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Why are you really here? What do you want? 
 JAMES (CONT'D) Here. That's a hundred dollars. I'm sorry but I'm gonna ask you to leave now. 123 
 You're so beautiful. You're so pretty. 
 Tell Pop to make sure she's taken care of. Whatever she needs. 
 JAMES 55 YRS 
 I'm OK. I'm OK. I'm OK.

 Teddy's funeral. 
 Right. Teddy's funeral. Damn. You look well. You shoulda called- 128 
 You know, Bobby, they still don't know what happened to Teddy and that boy. Those boys weren't drinkin' or doin' drugs. 
 I know, James. 
 No sir. Nothin' like that. He was a good boy. The car just hit that bridge head on. We ain't ever gone know how or why. They say he didn't feel a thing. 
 That's good, James. 
 But we brought him back to Augusta didn't we? Got him home then sent him on to the Lord. 
 We did, Mr. Brown.    We did. 
 OK. Mr. Byrd. I fixed your problem. I'll be back in the Spring to open her up. 
 I'm much obliged. Do I have to- 
 No no. We'll send the bill on. Well that's that. Good day Gentlemen.

 A little. You? 
 Not me. I just get stronger ever day. Gettin' better every day.

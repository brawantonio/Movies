 we? ALADDIN:    Trouble?  No way.  You're only in trouble if you get caught-- 
 Outrage! Scandal! ALADDIN:    Let's not be too hasty 
 PROPRIETOR:! JASMINE:        Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan. PROPRIETOR: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing? 
 C'mon,!' ALADDIN:    (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder than I thought. GENIE:  (Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE.  ABU screeches wildly.)  Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I didn't singe the fur!  Hey, Rugman!  Haven't seen you in a few millennia!  Slap me some tassel!  Yo! Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE. GENIE looks at ALADDIN.)  Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master. (Lifts his beer-gut.)  Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.  Look at me from the side--do I look different to you? ALADDIN:    Wait a minute!  I'm--your master? GENIE:  (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a mortarboard on his head.)  That's right!  He can be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as Arnold Schwarzenegger)  the ever impressive,(inside a cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with a dummy) often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside) but never duplicated-- 
 SULTAN:! JASMINE:    Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time. I'm so happy. SULTAN: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be,. I have chosen a husband for you. JASMINE:    What? SULTAN: (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.)  You will 
 wed.

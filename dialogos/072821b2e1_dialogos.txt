 TRISTAN + ISOLDE 
 A year younger than I was for my first. 
 When can I have a stag? 
 a stag? 
 Oh come on! 
 TRISTAN + ISOLDE 
 Why would they join up against the Irish? 
 Because someone has to stand up to them. 
 You? 
 Me, Marke, all the tribes. We can’t resist alone. 
 I could. 
 Oh my little warrior. We have to be careful. 
 Come home without something for your Lady there will be hell to pay. 
 Can I? 
 The Angles have arrives my Lord, as well as the Carrods, our fellow Jutes and the Saxons. 
 Good. With Marke, all will be here. 
 Yeah. It is a great day. 
 Let us hope so. 
 Thanks. 
 We heard the news... 
 Mother, I made this for you 
 Friends, look at us. 
 The tribes of Britain. Divided. Weak. Just as the Irish like us. But if we were one land united, we would out number them two to one. We could defeat them once and for all. That is why we are here today, to sign this treaty of unification. 
 But who would be King? 
 The strongest among us: Lord Marke. 
 Look if you are happy sending all of your gold to Ireland, living as slaves then by all means do nothing. 
 If we were happy doing that then we would never have risked coming here. 
 Friends. My wife is with child, my heart tells me it is a boy. I want him to grow old in a land where all of us, all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute, Saxon are at peace. This island has not known unity since the Romans left. That is why I sign this treaty. 
 Perhaps, Wictred, because your last attempt to form an alliance without the knowledge of half the Barons in this room has failed. 
 My Lord! The Irish are here! 
 Take all your men. Guard the women! 
 But you... 
 Go!!! 
 Tristan! Hurry! Come this way. 
 How did they know? 
 Tristan! 
 She’s with the Gods now Isolde, you’ll see her again someday. 
 Will I? 
 Morholt returns. 
 What news of the treaty? 
 Good Morholt, good 
 Your mother loved you so much Isolde 
 Why did she die Bragnae? Why? 
 It was an ill fever that took her. Fever. 
 No. It was her heart. 
 Your husband? 
 Oh sister I am so sorry. 
 A whole generation of men. 
 Who’s this? 
 Tristan. Son of Aragon. We’re his family now. 
 I have a son about your age. Melot! Melot!  Melot, this is Tristan. 
 What shall we do, my Lord? 
 Rebuild. 
 Don’t hold back 
 Tristan won’t fight me! Look he’s scared! 
 Still won't fight? 
 Why did you take off your helmet? You going to cry? My father died too, but you don’t see me crying! 
 Melot! 
 Run! Find another trapdoor to hide under. Coward! 
 Tristan! 
 Tristan! Tristan! We’ve found something! Come on, this way. 
 You will love it. 
 I found a trapdoor! 
 You found a trapdoor? Alright Simon, will you tell us all how you found it?! Look at that! 
 Where does this lead? 
 You’ll see. I like that vase, I think I'll have that. I always knew the Castle was built on Roman foundations but we didn’t think anything was left! 
 Must be a burial crypt or something. 
 Here we are: the bottom of the keep. 
 Who else knows about this? 
 Nobody. 
 Good. 
 The savages have rebuilt the castle at Cornwall, only now it’s made of stone. 
 Of Cornwall’s next tribute I want slaves. Young ones. Their future. If Marke resists have Morholt crush him. 
 My King. 
 Morholt. 
 I have led your armies to victory far and near. I’v made you rich and powerful. 
 Yes you have. You have been most loyal. 
 When I return from Cornwall, I was hoping... 
 What would please you? 
 A wife. 
 It’s dark in an hour. 
 What do you think is really out there? 
 Britannia. The old Roman lands. Full of evil and grief. 
 I want to see it. Do you know what the future looks like Bragnae? 
 I see the life you were meant for. Your father will speak with you. 
 Am I just a chattel to be traded at your pleasure? Do I have no say in my own life? 
 You have a duty to your King. 
 You are my father. 
 Then obey me, daughter. 
 Your father has given you the news? 
 And you welcome it? 
 I accept it. 
 You know, we are more alike than you might guess. 
 How so? 
 I too dabble in elixirs.  Poison from the livers of a puffer fish. Just a taste paralyses all the senses. So if the blade doesn’t kill... 
 Rendered safe by thistle and bark. 
 And you know the antidote for this? 
 Yohimbine. 
 Makes a hard man even harder.  The only cure... wild abandon. Till out wedding day. I’m to Cornwall, to deal with rabbles. 
 Release them. 
 Leave her! 
 Take him there. Get a rope. Any man foolish enough to interfere in any way shall suffer the same fate. 
 No! No! Please No! 
 If there are any more attacks we shall put our guests to death and raise this entire land. Take the horses. 
 When would you strike? 
 At once. Throw everything we have at them. 
 They are hoping you'll do that. On horse they outnumber us two to one. You would lead the men straight to their deaths. 
 So we do nothing?! 
 Donnchadh would like that even more. Me to lose face in front of the other tribes. No, we must act. We must be decisive but we cannot act alone. 
 So. Have the good men of York come to fight with us? Hm? The Saxons of Wessex? 
 Then why are you here? 
 I make it my habit to follow no one. 
 Marke delivered me from that place when I was a boy. You ran. So you can understand that when I think of Kings I think of him. When I think of cowards... 
 They are one day from their boats on the old Roman road. Now who will ride out with Tristan to fight them? 
 What is your plan, Tristan? 
 We will need our two fastest runners. 
 Go around! 
 Morholt, they’re back! 
 Kill the slaves! 
 Simon! 
 I don’t want to die. 
 Tristan! 
 I can’t feel my legs or my hands. 
 Poison. 
 Build a second boat. 
 Tristan! 
 He shall have a King's service. 
 Farewell, Tristan of Aragon. Death of the Irish. 
 When the Irish came to Cornwall and my father surrendered. You spared a dozen out of a hundred. I am even less kind. The leader and 3 shall take this message home. As for the rest... 
 Victory. 
 Tristan? 
 Simon too. 
 Did I love him like a son or did I misuse him for my own purposes? 
 He knew. He knew. 
 Where are we going? 
 Away. 
 You're afflicted child. Speak to me! Your father will find us and have my head. You are my charge. Please! 
 I am no ones charge! 
 You are. And you will be Morholt’s Lady! 
 And live a loveless life like my mam? 
 What’s that? 
 Where? 
 Isolde. Wait! Don’t!  Isolde. Don’t! Isolde! 
 It’s a man. 
 Dead? 
 Alive! Bragnae help me! 
 Isolde? 
 Help me! 
 Start a fire! Quickly! 
 His heart falters. 
 What are you doing? 
 He needs heat. Now! Get your clothes off! Quickly! 
 Hurry! Quickly! Smell that? Smell the poison? When he warms we will need thistle and bark. 
 I’ve not been naked with a man for 15 years! 
 Hello.  You've been sleeping a long time. You're in Ireland. Did you know that? Shh... It's alright. You're safe here. No one knows. Don't be scared. Just sleep... sleep. 
 Nooo Nooo Noo! 
 It’s alright, you don’t need that! I forgot to tell him about you... 
 I’ll wait outside with the other beasts. 
 You said no one else knew. 
 Sorry... She’s... My maid. Sworn to silence. Um... lie down please. Please? 
 It’s good you are remembering things. This might sting. Do you remember anything else? The boat I found you in? How you got this? Too many questions. Here keep it dry. Here I found bread, you have water and fire. The ocean is outside if you wish a bath. You won’t know where you are going so please don’t try to leave. Just trust me. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 I’ll be back 
 This is a dangerous game you are playing. He’s English, Isolde. 
 Then we’ve got him prisoner. 
 Under no circumstances tell him your name, you hear me? Not if you wish him to escape this place. Do you hear me? 
 You’ve been away. 
 I had noticed. Yes I have a bit. 
 Where? 
 Bragnae and I were spying the convent of Brittes ]. 
 Seeking sanctuary? 
 Some women need it. 
 You’ll find no refuge in a new religion. Your place is here, with Morholt. 
 Any word of my betrothed? 
 Overdue. But comforted no doubt that you yearn for him. 
 What's your name? 
 Oh, I think it's better if we don't bother with names. 
 How can I thank you if I don't have your name? 
 You just did. If you insist... my name is Bragnae. I'm a lady in waiting at the court. My parents are dead. My mother, she is the source of the kindness you find so puzzling. My father would've left you where you fell. 
 Tristan of Aragon. 
 Well Tristan of Aragon, I'd guess about you too, but I think I've already seen everything. 
 Sir! I hope you appreciate the risks we are taking, and will honour us by leaving as soon as you are able. 
 She likes me. She’s right though, you do risk. 
 There. What of your parents? 
 They also died when I was a child. 
 Of what? 
 A different type of Irish kindness. 
 Sorry. 
 Tomorrow then? 
 Tomorrow. 
 There she who bore you brought you forth. 
 Ridiculous. 
 I happen to believe what that says. Don’t you think there is more to life? 
 Than what? 
 Something more than duty and death! Why are we capable of feelings if not to have them? Why long for things if they are not meant to be ours? Well don’t listen to me. You’re so sure of things. You’re certainty, it’s like armour. I wish I had that. 
 Why would you need it? 
 The joy of being a lady? Wanting something I can’t have. A life of my own. 
 Time for sleep now. 
 I’ll follow you later. 
 You need to rest. In case your betrothed should want to see you. 
 You’re promised? 
 Yes. 
 What’s he like? 
 Dark. Tall. Nearly twice your size. An absolute gentleman. 
 I thought... earlier when you spoke of wanting something you can’t have. 
 I didn’t know what I was talking about. 
 Outside, just past that bluff there is a boat. That’s how you should go when you leave. You should go soon. 
 How do you feel? 
 I don’t know 
 Tristan! They’ve found your boat. At this very moment the King himself is scouring the coast. He will find you. He finds everyone. The tide is coming let’s go! 
 Come with me. Come with me! 
 I can’t 
 Why not? Please! 
 Tristan, we’ve both known this can’t be. We’ve known this from the start. That doesn’t mean it isn’t true. It is. It just cannot be. I want to know that you are alive somewhere thinking of me from time to time. I want to know that there is more to this life and I can’t know that if they kill you. Please? 
 Go! 
 A Cornish warrior may be ashore. Beware. We seek him as I speak. Hopefully it is just his rotted corpse we'll find, for he has slain your betrothed. Morholt is dead. Fallen in battle. Isolde? Bragnae, comfort her. 
 She’s stunned. 
 As am I by her grief. 
 We should assulat the British straight away. Crush them with maximum force. 
 Maximum force. Like that of Marke’s tribe with the maximum force you speak of? I will not confront them again until our numbers are refreshed. Until then, we’ll have cunning divide them. 
 Of what nature? 
 A prize, perhaps. 
 What’s this about a tournament? 
 Donnchadh. He has offered his daughter and the lands of Lyonesse as dowry to whichever English tribe wins. It is a clever way of setting us against each other. 
 Well, the other barons will see through that. 
 For yourself you mean. 
 And what of the support you promised Tristan? 
 And ours as well. 
 So be it. 
 You're weary, let me rally your friends. I’ll lead them against D... 
 Ah, Melot, Melot, Melot. You are my blood and you are a noble presence but...... 
 Lord Marke! He’s back! It’s Tristan! 
 It cannot be! 
 Tristan! 
 I saw you dead. 
 I am delivered. 
 How? How? 
 A toast! Tristan! Back from the dead. 
 Tristan. The Irish King offers his daughter in tournament to divide the tribes. For the power and the wealth half the tribes have sent champions to fight at the...  Tristan! 
 God knows what happened to him. 
 "My face in thine eyes, thine in mine appears, 
 What? 
 It is the only way to keep the alliance alive. 
 I fail to see how fighting with our partners keeps us allies. 
 Well they are all going to the tournament anyway. By announcing you will share the dowry with every Baron that remains loyal and in turn offering to support whomever prevails, the others would be compelled to follow you when you win. 
 If we win. If we lose we could end up following Wictred. I’d need an infallible champion! 
 Me. 
 You are not yet healed. 
 Then this trip will be my tonic. I will be ready. I know I will. 
 What is the source of this fervour? 
 Let me go and win you a wife. She can make peace without spilling one drop of blood, and maybe heal a wound from which you still lack. 
 Truce. You have safe passage. 
 How do I look? 
 How do you look? 
 Where is this Princess? What’s her name? Isolde? I want to see what she looks like. 
 There. Almost done. 
 No, not quite. If I am to be a present I should be fully wrapped. 
 See how the bees come to the honey. 
 Tristan of Aragon. 
 So he lives. 
 For the moment. 
 Why Wictred? 
 Because the Barons will never unite behind him. 
 Do you think she’s got the pox? 
 Since the dawn of time... 
 ... Begin! 
 WICTRED’S OPPONENT Make it for real! 
 WICTRED’S OPPONENT I yield! 
 You were great! 
 Allow it! 
 It was too easy for you Tristan. Not much for a third draw. 
 One more fight Tristan. Take deep breaths. 
 Wictred: Lord of Saxonberg. Tristan: Champion of Cornwall. Warriors: Begin! 
 Yield! 
 An impressive victory. Of course the man who defeats Morholt might be expected to triumph here. 
 On behalf of Cornwall, I offer your daughter a place on our throne. The throne of England, united behind one leader. 
 Isolde! Perhaps it is just that he who took a husband provides one. 
 I’m yours. 
 No. Tristan of Aragon has won you on behalf of Lord Marke of Cornwall. 
 Let’s go. 
 Let them take her across the sea. After the wedding I'll disavow Isolde, the alliance will crumble. 
 Tristan. Princess wants to speak to you. 
 You risked your life to give me to another man. 
 You said your name was Bragnae. Why did you do that? 
 Oh what have I done? Stop this thing. Say something. 
 I can't. I won you in my King's name. 
 But I am yours. You touched me and I yielded... 
 It doesn't matter. 
 It is the only thing that matters Tristan. Leave with me, I will go anywhere. 
 Your marriage will end a hundred years of bloodshed. 
 My marriage to another man! 
 Isolde. You will live with this. We must. 
 Don't do this to me. 
 Tristan, we’ve made shore. 
 What if she’s a hag? Or maybe she won’t have me! 
 She will brother. You’re the prize. 
 My Lord. 
 Isolde? Welcome. 
 If things were different. If we lived in a place without duty... would you be with me? 
 That place does not exist. 
 I'll pretend it's you. 
 You’re trembling. You are far from home and I am a stranger still. But you mustn’t fear me. My wish is to make you happy, as a wife.. as a women and hopefully one day, the fact that I am not whole will not offend you. 
 That’s pretty. Did you make it? 
 It was a present. 
 Tristan? 
 Might I stay here a while? 
 Of course. 
 Tristan! 
 I’ve never seen him like this before. 
 Perhaps someone his own age should speak with him. 
 They believe you are distant. They are worried about you. So am I. 
 I can tell. Laughing at the market, holding hands, a caress on the neck when he pours you wine. 
 He is my husband. I remember his Kingdom comes before my life. 
 Yes well, I must confess I thought you might find more difficulties in performing your duty. 
 Am I not permitted a single moment without mourning? Living with this Tristan as you said we must. 
 I live in torture thinking of these moments. With every look he gives you I get sicker and sicker. There is a burning in me, I feel on fire and guilt and I can't get rid of either. Does it make you happy to know that? 
 The Roman Bridge. I can get to it without being seen. And I will go there anytime to be there with you. 
 Welcome bands of Anglia, Rothgar and Orick. Wessex: Kaye and Wictred. 
 It does. On the next full moon, all will attend. 
 Bearing that in mind, and given the instabilities of our new land I shall be naming a second. My sister has raised one, capable of guiding you if the need should arise. He is a man of passion, fierce in battle who has learnt to tame his heart with his head. I give you Tristan of Aragon. 
 For the first time since the Romans, this country stands united. 
 I can’t be your second. Melot must be. He is blood. Besides, I wish to journey north. 
 You no longer sleep at Dor, and now you don’t want to be my second. Do you find no comfort in your home? These stone walls that you helped build? 
 I find these walls a prison. 
 Why? 
 Everything I want seems misplaced. 
 Ever since you were a boy you sacrificed everything for me. All for one dream. Now that you reached that dream, it is natural that you would feel some loss. It doesn’t matter if you want to be second. You are. I will only be king if you are my second. I’d put it more gently if I could. 
 Then I am your second. 
 Perhaps it is time that you took a wife! 
 No! 
 Can’t live alone forever. 
 I can! 
 Isolde. I was trying to explain to Tristan the importance of loving. It seems he might live without it. 
 Why? 
 There are other things to live for. Duty. Honour. 
 But they are not life Tristan. They are the shells of life. And empty ones and in the end all they hold is days and days without love. Love is made by God. Ignore it and you can suffer as you cannot imagine. 
 Then I will no longer live without it. 
 Good. Very good! Come, we will be late! 
 Late? 
 The warriors ride out on the full moon. It is an old ritual. I shall miss you tonight. 
 How many did you love before me? 
 None. 
 And after me? 
 None. 
 Lord Marke! Are you hurt? 
 Nothing but for my pride. 
 Tristan, I need to speak with you. 
 Go ahead. 
 We haven’t even had a coronation yet to mark tradition. But now he breaks tradition and scares all the barons by naming you as second. 
 I tried to convince him you would be better. 
 Yes well, peace can be just as treacherous as war and I feel that Marke doesn’t really...Listen to me!!! Our attention must be on Cornwall now more than ever. 
 I am sorry he didn’t choose you. I am. 
 Can I speak to you? 
 What do you think became of them? 
 They were lives... just lived. 
 I find myself imaging things in this place. I decorate it. Books, a harp there... a child. 
 Would it be his or mine? 
 I would have no way to tell, would I? He is a kind man Tristan, I cannot hate him. Yesterday at the market I saw a couple holding hands, and I realised we would never do that. Never anything like it. No picnics or unguarded smiles. No rings. Just stolen moments that leave too quickly. 
 Where is Isolde? 
 I don’t know for sure, she was having a walk in the garden before and I’m afraid I got tired so I returned. It’s my fault. 
 You’re going to get caught! Both of you! He’s looking for you right now, he’ll see you! I told you this would happen! 
 There is another door here, forgotten. This comes up in the bottom chamber of the keep. 
 I hate this. 
 Hurry! Go on. 
 I’m tired of this. I’m tired of lying for you. I’m sick of it. 
 Then don’t. 
 There is a servings child, quite ill. Doing better now. 
 I didn’t ask you were you were. Your heart is beating so fast. 
 Is it? 
 Isolde. Is there anything I can do to make you happier. I want to make you happy. 
 I’m fine. 
 How? 
 And your price? 
 When his throne falls apart, we’ll go over and pick up the pieces. 
 Tristan? Can I speak with you? Is it possible... do you think a man blinded by love... Is it possible that that man might not see treachery right in front of him? 
 No. 
 Perhaps you could follow her. I can’t ask anyone else. I know. I know what you think – I’m acting like a child. Normally I can read faces, but with hers I feel like... I can't be objective. She’s so delicate. 
 You really love her. 
 Oh... I do...terribly. I didn’t know how empty I was. She sustains me, she thrills me. And when I see this ring, it is a ring of thorns. 
 The ring is nothing. She's loyal to you. I am sure of it. 
 ... If you say so. 
 I count nine 
 If they move they will warn us with a black flag 
 You bring an entourage? 
 I can let myself be alone in my position Lord Marke. But don’t worry, they will stay offshore.  I miss you. 
 My nephew, Merlot of Cornwall 
 And Tristan, slayer of my best general, winner of Isolde, defender of the alliance. You are a fortunate man. 
 Indeed. 
 Tristan! Seems I worried for nothing. 
 That’s right, you have never danced with Isolde before! 
 Why did you burn it? 
 You know. 
 Meet me there in an hour or I’ll die. 
 I could still teach you a thing or two, dancing being one of them. 
 Accuse him now. 
 Is something the matter? 
 I’m just feeling a little weary that’s all. I might just go and have a lie down. 
 Of course. 
 We honour it. In half a night. Ride out! Where’s Tristan? 
 I miss Ireland 
 Isolde, this must end. 
 That’s like asking me to stop breathing. 
 It cannot be. 
 Please don’t leave me. Please! 
 Isolde? There is someone...  No. 
 I see how it is in Cornwall. My money is good enough, my alliance is good enough, but my daughter you pass amoung your lieutenants like a whore! 
 It’s not like that. 
 I see no relation to me here! I will see this peace end. 
 Seize him. Seize him. 
 Behold your hero uncle  I would have no heroes now. 
 They’re ashore. 
 Prove your worth. 
 If a man can’t rule his woman, how can he govern an entire Kingdom? 
 He can’t. 
 We have suffered peace. 
 It’s all been coming apart. I can feel it 
 You’re right. 
 What’s this? 
 And who might that be, Wictred? 
 I like this plan. 
 I came to apologise. I’ve been selfish arrogantly thinking that perhaps I’d given enough. At least enough to merit if not your love then at least your respect. You have a home. A kingdom. Why was it not enough? Tell me.  Tell me! You do not know what you have done! Everything is destroyed, everything! All because you did not have enough. She’s loyal to you I am sure of it. You bloodsucker. What could it had been had I not stretched out my hand to save your life. How I curse that day, how I curse it. And so be with your defence. Then I will go complete your punishment, Donnchadh marches on us as we speak. 
 She’s young. I will not let you harm her! 
 How long? 
 Since you thought he was dead. I found him wounded on the beach in Ireland. I hid him from my father and I told him my name was Bragnae. So when he came to the tournament at Dunluce to win Donnchadh’s daughter he didn’t realise it was me. All this time my heart has been his, and I am sorry. He tried harder than you can possibly imagine because he loves you. 
 I will coax him out, make sure Donnchadh knows this. 
 Tristan and Isolde? 
 The tunnel. 
 The Roman Tunnel! 
 What is this? 
 The will of the King. Farwell. 
 I told him about Ireland. He’s given us our freedom. Why does loving you feel so wrong? 
 Get in. 
 Tristan, if I do this. 
 For all time, they will say it was our love that brought down a kingdom. Remember us. 
 Tristan, don’t! Tristan! Tristan! Tristan! Why?! Tristan! 
 Get the livestock and fuel undercover. Put some archers on the ramparts. 
 And you stay? 
 If you are surprised then they have won already. 
 Burn it. Their will is as strong as milk. The seas will unravel us. Where is Wictred with his key? 
 It comes up to the Roman foundations at the lowest level. 
 That he will not make any more mistakes and that it is time for him to move ba – what’s that?! 
 Aim for the front of the line 
 They are waiting. 
 The Irish are inside! 
 Follow me! 
 You. 
 What happened here? 
 A reward for idiocy. A dozen Irish have blazed your way. 
 Melot, I came to aid Marke. 
 Everyone lies. 
 I didn’t lead them here. 
 No, I did. 
 Why? 
 I thought someone believed in me. 
 It will be undone. 
 Tristan—I’m for the worms—swear to me that you are true. 
 As we were brothers. 
 Build my boat. 
 They’re here! 
 MARKE’S MAN Wictred. 
 He’s trying to lower the bridge 
 MARKE’S MAN Traitor! 
 Give me your shield, we’re pinned down! 
 Tristan! 
 MARKE’S MAN Him too? 
 No, he’s with us! 
 Tristan! 
 Tristan! How did you get here? 
 Secret. Secrets, in the bowls of the keep. 
 In the bowls of the keep. 
 They have reached the palisades. 
 Get back! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! 
 Behold! The head of a traitor! 
 Will you always be little men, who cannot see what was and could be again? There is no middle ground! So slay us  or slay him! 
 Oblidge them.  Oblidge them! 
 Take me out of here. Take me to the river. 
 Bring her. 
 I must heed their call, I am the King. 
 Know that I love you Tristan. And wherever you go, whatever you see, I will always be with you. 
 You were right. I do not know if life is greater than death, but love was more than either.

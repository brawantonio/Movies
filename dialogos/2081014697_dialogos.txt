 
 Last delivery's finally here. The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard references the sounds from upstairs -- ARMORED TRUCK GUARD Party? 
 Introducing a new line of jewelry. ARMORED TRUCK GUARD Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring. Told her to spend a little time with the family jewels first. PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside. Handing over the satchel and heading out -- ARMORED TRUCK GUARD Keep it real. 
 Watch yourself. Miles nods. 
 Keep it tight. Miles nods again, and they set off. 
 Bull's-eye. Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.    Fait pulls out a cell phone. 
 (V.O.) Yes? 
 (V.O.) We're in position. 
 (V.O.) Delivery confirmed. The stones are there. 
 (V.O.) Not for long. 
 CLICK.   HISS. Su didn't like what he just heard.       Curses in Chinese.   And takes off. 
 (0.S.) Where are the stones? 
 (French accent) Who the fuck are you? Wham.   The Chinese boxing version of a bitch-slap. 
 Who's getting them for you? 
 Fuck off. Wham!   Wham!   Wham!     Wham!   Much more violent than a bitch- slap. 
 I'll tell you. 
 I know. 
 Daria. 
 I'm here for the reception. 
 Name, please? 
 Angie Rawlins. Douglas scans a list of names.      Checks off hers. 
 Thank you. You can go on up.       Front elevator, to the mezzanine. Daria turns toward the elevator. Then doesn't go. Just glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic. 
 ... I hate these things.      Don't you hate these things? 
 I'm just here to do my job. Daria looks back at Douglas.      Studies him a moment.   Liking what she sees. 
 Then again, you never know who you're going to meet... She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage.      Then leans over the desk. Giving Douglas an eyeful. 
 
 Really, ma'am.   I have a job to do. Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her. Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk. 
 DARIA'S POV The magazine is Genre.   Males for males.   Buff boys.   Big pecs, big penises. 
 Well, I suppose I should go up and see what they're selling. Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY. 
 Tommy... What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as Daria walks toward Tommy: She whispers into a hidden mike -- 
 Change of plans. He's gay. Tommy hears it over his earwig. 
 No way. 
 Yeah way. INTERCUT WITH: 
 Tommy.    Your turn. 
 Uh-uh. 
 This isn't a conversation.    Do it. It's an order.    Tommy knows he has to.   Shit. 
 Shit. 
 Key-card. 
 Why don't you keep my purse?     I shouldn't be too long. Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him. Then heads toward the elevator, as... Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face. 
 ... Aloha. (NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20 thru 28.) Douglas looks up from his magazine. 
 Hi. 
 I hope you don't take offense at this... but I just have such a weakness for a man in uniform. 
 If that's your thing... 
 Uniform's definitely my thing. I mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking, mmm, seafood. Y'know? 
 I'm not actually supposed to be 
 Who's talking? Honey, this is a flirting... But you're probably just another good-looking man wasting it all on women. World's full of fools. Beat.   Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine. 
 Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have- A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the pictures of those underfed, white males and let's broaden your horizons. 
 TOMMY (CONT'D) I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm not too cute for you. And don't tell me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll come over there and slap a little discrimination right upside your yummy little cheeks. 
 I'm hooked up. 
 Another big, hot, cuddly, black love- Jesus got there first. That bitch. Taking you. From me. 
 Sorry. 
 Hey... This day and age, sweetie, I can appreciate the monogamy. Saving it for your number one is keeping the world safe, and it's okay by me. Even if you are just breaking my heart... Guess I'll just have to come in here someday, let you catch me shoplifting and resist arrest -- just to have you wrestle me down and cuff me. 
 I can be pretty rough. 
 Don't you get me all excited now.   I was just learning to accept my disappointment. 
 Tommy.     But you can call me Rachel. 
 Douglas. And, man, I really gotta get back to what I'm supposed to be doing, okay? He looks away.     Scans the monitors. 
 ANGLE - MONITORS Everything looks normal. 
 I'll leave you alone. But is it okay if I just stand here and stare at the muscles I'll be missing for the rest of my life? OFF which... 
 As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at... 
 who furtively flips her the bird.        Never missing a beat with Douglas. 
 Out. 
 ... I want to report a crime in progress. 
 Faith. 
 Faith. 
 Faith. Fait pulls out a remote control firing device.   He pushes the button. And... 
 Earthquake. 
 Bet you know how to hit a ten on the Richter scale... 
 Holy shit... 
 This will trigger the silent alarm. Let's go. We got eleven minutes. Miles moves down the rows of   drawers, using a tool to pop all the locks. Fait and Daria   follow behind, quickly pulling out the drawers and emptying   jewels into nylon bags. Fait empties drawer after drawer.    All white diamonds. When... He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds.     And stops, admiring them. 
 ... I love colored stones... Look at this... He holds up a small, faceted blue diamond. 
 Two-point-seven million. Into the bag. 
 Whose shit we stealing, anyway? 
 Drug dealers and money launderers. 
 Works for me. Then something else catches his eye. He holds up a small, pink diamond on a chain. Admires it. 
 This I can use. 
 T. 
 Pow. He takes the bag. Stows it in his jacket. When... Suddenly, Fait's CELL PHONE RINGS. Surprising them.   Beat. Fait answers. 
 Go. INTERCUT WITH: 
 Your employer betrayed you. The police are on the way. Leave the black stones. 
 Who is this? 
 You know the ones I mean. 
 Don't think I'll do that. Fait just hangs up. 
 Shit.  Five-0 at the do'. (then, aloud to Douglas) Better move my car. 
 Go time.     Leave the rest. 
 Move it out. 
 Stopped the trains. (then) We're in the rabbit hole, they're sending down the snakes. (then) Daria comes with me. (to Miles) I got no idea where you should go, but you know where to end up. Miles nods. 
 Faith. 
 Faith. 
 #2 All clear. 
 Fait turns back to Daria. Signals her to climb up onto the top of the train. Then begins climbing after her. As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT COP approaching the train's DRIVER, checking under seats, etc. Fait has to climb fast. The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting closer. Looking up. Just as... 
 #3 Hold it. 
 #3 (radios) Train's clear. The Cop exits.    The Driver enters his compartment. 
 Okay to go? 
 #4 Just hang tight. During which, just above them... Fait and Daria lie very still. Daria's tense. Fait winks at her, trying to relax her. Daria's still tense. He raises his eyebrows slightly. Shifts his gaze down. She doesn't get it. Finally follows his gaze. Sees her position is giving him a full view of her cleavage. She looks back at him in disbelief. 
 Nice. That does it. She relaxes and smiles back. Under which a voice crackles over the SWAT Cop's radio. 
 (V.O.) All clear. 
 #4 (to Driver) Okay.    Get this train outta here. Whereupon the train jerks to a start. 
 The stones. 
 You'll have to come and get 'em. 
 Hope we're not here long.    I hate sunshine. Ling kisses Sona on the lips.    Then -- 
 We may have a problem. Ling's mood quickly darkens. LING The stones? 
 The exchange was just robbed. LING ... Let's hope that was part of the plan. 
 -- 
 
 Who wants to know? Su flashes I.D. We don't see it.   The Cop scopes it a moment. He's clearly impressed. 
 Follow me. As he leads Su toward his superiors in the vault... 
 You know it's past your bedtime. 
 Just a little longer. 
 (imitating sweetly) 'Just a little longer'... School tomorrow, baby. Let's go. Vanessa sighs. Fait stands over her as she shuts down the computer, talking her through the commands, making sure she doesn't dawdle. 
 'Exit.' 'Quit.' 'Do not save.' 'Special.' 'Shut down.' Sleepy- time. Whereupon he whisks her out of her chair, flies her once around the room and tucks her into bed. 
 You bag some Z's now, you hear? 
 Okay. 
 ... Wait a second. 
 What? 
 I think there's something behind your 
 Oh, please, that is so lame.     It's in your hand. 
 How'd you do that? 
 Good night. Then Fait looks up.     Addresses the air above her. 
 Angels east, angels west, north and south, do your best. Guard her, watch her, while she rests. A bedtime ritual. Fait goes. When she's alone, Vanessa holds up the diamond, which catches every bit of available light and shines in the dark. Then she rolls over and closes her eyes. 
 She'll stay down now. 
 She won't listen to me lately.     Only you. 
 I'll have a talk with her about it tomorrow. Still to the nanny -- 
 I got some work to do in the office. You can go on to bed. 
 I'm watching TV, if you need me. Fait exits. 
 What the hell happened? Fait puts a finger to his lips.    Leads them across the room to another door. 
 Should we be considering a long vacation in a warm, foreign climate where there's no extradition? Fait's thinking it through. 
 The guy who called was only interested in the black stones... 
 Christophe sold us out. 
 Or something. Just then, Miles enters. 
 You made it. 
 By the skin of my ass. Some Chinese dude kicked me around the motherfuckin' block. Busted my ear piece. He takes the broken communication device out of his ear and tosses it on the table. 
 Snagged my loot, too... Maybe time to 
 Little ass-whuppin's nothing. 'Least you didn't have to play all foxy with the rent-a-cop. 
 Means this is all we got. 
 So what do we do? 
 You all wait to hear from me. 
 Where're you going? 
 To get some answers. Miles moves to go with him. 
 I got your back. 
 No. I got us into this.     I'll call you if I need you. Daria moves to him.   Their eyes meet. 
 Be careful. Fait gives her a kiss.   Then goes. 
 Yes. Only the handcuffs and fish tank are a new look. LING Apparently we're not his first visitors today. 
 Please, Monsieur Ling -- Ling interrupts him with a hand on the shoulder. 
 (O.S.) Bang. A hatch opens. ARCHIE, a fairly straight-ahead-looking man, pops his head up out of the tank. 
 Like it? 
 It's cool. As Archie climbs out of the tank and joins Fait -- 
 Want it? Give you a good deal. Ammo included... Reactive armor, twin M240 machine guns, 120mm smoothbore cannon. Guaranteed to get you through the rougher areas of the city and keep the neighbors in line. 
 Pass. 
 How about a Marine Corps assault hovercraft? 
 I got other business. Fait and Archie walk to a work table. Nearby, two MEN UNLOAD HOT TVS from a truck. One Man calls to Archie. MAN UNLOADING HOT TVS We're outta room over here, Arch. 
 Stack 'em in the office, if you have to. Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait. 
 ... You weren't downtown tonight by any chance, were you, Tony? 
 Don't know what you're talking about. 
 Me either. 
 Ever see black diamonds before? 
 White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil Diamond. Lou Diamond Phillips. Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No. Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup. Studies them a moment. Shrugs. 
 You got me. 
 Find out how much they're worth. 
 There a timetable on this, or -- 
 Yesterday. 
 That's what I figured. 
 I'll be back. I gotta go fuck over a guy who fucked me over. 
 (O.S.) Looks dead to me. Behind him.   Fait turns around.      Sees Su.   Sitting on a sofa. 
 Guess you got to him first. 
 Not me.     Someone else. Fait does the math. 
 ... You're the one who called me. The one who took on my guy... Who the fuck are you, man? 
 My name is Su. 
 Cool.     I'm Sally. 
 I want the black stones. 
 Yeah?   Make me an offer. Su stands. 
 You can walk out of here. 
 ... No deal. Fait launches   himself at Su. Gonna fight     his way    out the door. A much    better fighter than Miles.     And...    He's saved by the bell:    the PHONE RINGS. The fight     stops.     The phone's near   Fait. Beat. The answering      machine    picks up. 
 (V.O.) Christophe here. Leave a message. 
. LING (V.O.) I know you're there, Mr. Fait. Beat.   Fait pushes the button for the speakerphone. 
 Who's this? INTERCUT WITH: 
 Fine.   How much? LING Maybe you didn't understand me.    The stones are already mine. 
 I got 'em, I'm selling 'em. So get your bid in or go fuck yourself. 
 That your final offer? 
 Everybody think I'm the fucking Goodwill or something...? Look, I've had a shitty night, and so far, I got zip for all my troubles. So I don't know who the fuck you are, and I don't care. But hear this: you can beat my ass around the block all night -- Brother, it ain't gonna get you those stones. A long beat. The two men facing off. Then... As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out... 
 Oh, man... He's about    to punch it. When... A cop car turns a corner and falls    in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps driving.     Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now... Fait hits    it. Until... Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi- industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow, but is cut off by the on-coming cars. We STAY WITH Fait. He GUNS down the alley. Reaches an intersecting alley. Turns. GUNS it out of sight. 
 #1 Give us the stones. 
 Man, how many times I gotta tell people: I'm a business man. Make me a motherfucking offer. 
 #2 Here's your offer. He cocks his pistol.   Beat. 
 That shit ain't gonna do it, biggie. 'Cause I ain't scared of guns, and I ain't got the stones. 
 #1 Then you're gonna tell us where they are. Whereupon a... 
 Spins through the air. The bottle knocks the gun from one Killer's hand. The gun skids under a nearby chain-link fence. 
 the person who threw the bar.   Su. The fight's on.   Two on 
 Over here. Fait follows, right on his heels. The dogs close in. Su reaches the car. Dives through the open door. Somersaults over the rear seat. Kicks open the far door and rolls out. Fait dives in right behind him. The Dobies leap in after Fait. Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the other side of the car. Clears the door. And... Su slams the door shut. We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that door, too. Trapping the SNARLING, foaming DOGS inside. The bad guys are gone. And Fait's CELL PHONE is RINGING. As Fait digs out the phone, to Su -- 
 Man, what the hell's up with these fucking stones? (into phone) Go. 
 It's Archie.    Bad news.   We got a problem. 
 (O.S.) ... I did what you said, right? Put it out on the street, trying to get info on the stones. Next thing I know, the Jackson Five here show up... Now, there are three significant elements to notice here. One, I'm outnumbered. Two, they're heavily armed. Three, they're gonna beat me like a bongo drum... 
 ... I mean, hey, I coulda resisted, sure -- and they coulda beat me into a coma or killed me or whatever -- but then, see, I'm thinking: How would I be able to tell Tony what happened to the stones? Right? What good am I dead or on life-support. So I threw in the towel. Reluctantly, of course. For your sake. 
 Okay. You saved yourself to tell me. So tell me. 
 What? 
 Who are they? 
 Uh... Don't know. 
 What'd they say? 
 Well... 'Give us the stones, motherfucker.' You know. That kinda thing. 
 That's it? 
 Pretty much.    Yeah. 
 Thanks for keeping yourself alive to pass on all that valuable information. 
 Did you call the police? 
 Look around. Are you crazy? Then again, maybe you are crazy, 'cause I have no idea who you are. 
 Big question is, who's behind the boost? 
 (re: footage) I don't know that, but I know they got great guns. I can't even get those. U.S. Special Forces only. 
 ... Chambers. 
 What? 
 He's wired into everything going down in this city, and he can get that kind of firepower. Gotta be him. 
 Who's Chambers? 
 Runs the biggest outfit in town. What warlords are to Afghanistan, Chambers is to L.A... And you want to take him on, you're on your own. Game over for me. (beat; then) And now that I'm truly fucked -- what the hell are you, anyway? You got some I.D.? Beat.   Su takes out his wallet and shows him. 
 - I.D. 
 Doesn't mean shit to me. 
 Let me see that. Archie takes it, reads. 
 Taiwan. Central Security Bureau. Taiwanese intelligence. 
 You read Chinese? 
 No. But I know 'cop' in every language. 
 What, you some kinda Asian James Bond? 
 The stones belong to my government. 
 Yeah, well, they're Chambers' now. And even governments don't go to war with him. UNDER which, Fait's CELL PHONE starts RINGING. 
 I'm starting to hate this phone. (answers) What now? 
 Hey, it's Mr. Dangerous.   'Sup, 'homie'? LING You've made this difficult, Mr. Fait. Let me make it easy. 
 Can't wait to hear. LING I have your daughter. Fait freezes. LING She's very pretty in her pink pajamas. Aren't you, Vanessa? REVEAL Vanessa, in the limo, held by Charles.     On Ling's signal, Charles uncovers her mouth. 
 Daddy! 
 Vanessa! LING I want my stones, Mr. Fait. 
 Motherfucker... LING You think about it a moment. Let me talk to the Chinese gentleman who's with you. 
 Don't you hurt her. LING That's up to you... The Chinese 
 He has my daughter. 
 Oh, Jesus... 
 He wants to talk to you. Su takes the phone.   In CHINESE with ENGLISH SUBTITLES -- 
 Hello. LING I thought I killed you. 
 I have the stones.      No negotiations. Let the girl go. LING Do you really want one more person to die? We see this resonates with Su. 
 No negotiations. And then, he simply hangs up. END INTERCUT. 
 What'd you just do?     What happened? 
 I said I have the stones and won't negotiate for your daughter. 
 You what? 
 Oh, Jesus... 
 It will confuse him.     Buy us time and keep her alive. 
 
 Look -- I know him. (then) I want the stones, you want your daughter. We'll get them both back. We'll work together. 
 ... I gotta work with you? 
 You have no choice. 
 ... Shit... We gotta go see Chambers... (beat, then) Oh, god... Vanessa... 
 My daddy's gonna come and kick your butts. Sona just reaches out and slaps her. It hurts and surprises Vanessa. Tears come to her eyes. But she's Fait's daughter: she won't let this bitch make her cry. Charles takes Vanessa out. Ling's mind is still on the phone call. LING Su says he has the stones... But why cut me off? Why not negotiate for the girl? It doesn't make sense. 
 
 What about the girl? 
 I'm on the way to Chambers... Yeah, I know, but I got no other choice. Just get the word into his pipeline that I'm coming and want permission to visit... I'll get back to you... Faith... (hangs up) Maybe Chambers'll have a heart and give the stones back. (then) Yeah, right -- and maybe he'll join the Peace Corps. Su looks over.     Beat. 
 I'm sorry about your daughter... How old is she? 
 This ain't the Biography Channel. Let's just get there. A long beat.     L.A. moving by outside. 
 Eight.   She'll be nine in September. Beat. 
 
 Never happen.    I'll just kill 'em. 
 I wish it were that easy. Another beat.   Then -- 
 About time I got the 4-1-1. 
 4-1-1? 
 What's this all about? 
 The stones aren't what you think they are. 
 No shit. (then) How about the guy who has Vanessa? 
 He's exactly what you think he is -- a thief and a killer. 
 Great... 
 Where'd you get that piece of shit? 
 #1 Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa have a long walk back from the 
 You're sure you cleaned it out? 
 #1 Everything except the denture cream and adult diapers. Vanessa's still screaming.   It's getting on Charles' nerves. 
 I'm sick of her already. He marches toward the van.   Unlocks the rear door and slides it open. 
 Shut up! 
 You shut up! 
 Go to sleep! Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV.   Turns it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as... Charles slams the door shut.   Locks it.   And... Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark camper. Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it. A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the fear go away, but giving her strength. 
 CLOSEUP - FAIT As he drives, just as if he can sense Vanessa's need for him -- 
 Angels east, angels west, north and south, do your best. Guard her, watch her, while she rests. 
 Metz. The guard, METZ, stops and looks back. 
 D.V.D.'s broke. 
 Get you a new one straight away, Mr. Chambers. Metz goes. Beat.   Chambers eyes Fait and Su through his cigar smoke. 
 Thanks for your patience.   Man needs his nightly rest. (then) Who's the gook? 
 ... Chinese guy. 
 ... No shoes in my crib. 
 In. The sentries move aside. Fait and Su enter. Chambers ash- trays his Cuban and digs into b-fast. 
 How you doing, Jump? 
 Don't waste my precious time. 
 ... I got a problem. 
 How's Daria? 
 ... Good. 
 Always was good. From the moment I found her till the moment you took her away from me. Problem, you say? 
 ... The black stones. 
 Bitch brought it in. Made me a lotta money. But that all stopped. You stopped that. You decided it was okay to put an end to that. Black stones. Go on. 
 I need 'em back. 
 Only smart thing was not pimping her yourself, 'cause then I'da been real sore-angry, and you'da both been real cold-dead... 
 CHAMBERS (CONT'D) But you don't pimp, do you? Just a 
 You like tall white women? Su doesn't say anything.   Back to English -- 
 He can't talk? 
 I don't speak Korean. 
 Bought myself this Korean club downtown. Packing in the Seoul brothers 24-7-365... Black man gouging Koreans, ain't that a switch... Motherfuckers got faces like walls, but they love to drink liquor and look at naked girls... Place is no shitbox, either. Got me an office looks like a kabuki love palace. My own little sanctuary -- A QUICK SHOT OF Fait, taking this in. 
 -- just waiting for when I parole out... Stop by sometime, eyeball the poon. 
 ... Jump, my daughter's mixed up in this. I gotta have the stones, or she's dead. No response.   Chambers just keeps eating. 
 If you need something more than that, here it is... (this is hard) I'm begging you, Jump. Still no response... Chambers finishes eating.    Wipes his face. Finally -- 
 Big heist. Risky heist. Breaking news. I'm watching it wondering why. 
 She's my little girl. 
 Make another one... Lotta offspring running around. Big scores're rare in a lifetime. Another beat.   That's it.   No deal. 
 Slope's no dope. He indicates behind them. They turn. The two cell sentries are wielding prison shanks. So is Willy Chickens. 
 Let me cut one of these motherfuckers. 
 Your choice. Chickens is happy.   Thrusts the knife at Fait.       When... Su reaches out and catches the   blade.  Catches it with just the thumb and forefinger of one   hand.  And holds it like that. Holds it hard. Chickens     can't push and can't pull. Doesn't know what to do next.    Finally yanks really hard. And... Su lets go. Chickens goes backward, ass over teakettle. A beat. Then, to Fait -- 
 Say hey to Daria. And don't forget your shoes. 
 I used to look up to that guy.      All I wanted was to be like him. 
 In Taiwan, I could force him to talk. 
 This ain't Taiwan. (then) Only thing we can do now is find out where the stones are and go take 'em. 
 You make it sound easy. 
 It won't be. They're about to get in the car. Fait stops.     Looks back at the prison. Suddenly realizing something. 
 ... They're at his club. 
 How do you know? 
 I know. I can feel it.      That ever happen to you? 
 No. 
 I thought Chinese people were all mystical and shit. 
 We like to gamble.     Not guess. 
 It's no guess... But I could be wrong... We'll hit the club. You gotta see Archie. 
 Archie? 
 He's gotta remember something about the guys who took down his place. 
 What if he can't? 
 Pretend it's Taiwan.    Make him remember. 
 Hey!    Get away from there! Russell hurries over, extremely edgy, almost manic. 
 What are you doing?! 
 Whoa. Take it easy. Just seeing if I could help with something. 
 You can't! It's very delicate equipment! Stay away! Just stay away from my truck! 
 What? 
 Stay away from my truck! 
 What? 
 Stay away from my truck! 
 What? Sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby. 
 Stop it. Charles does. And now we can hear Vanessa, who's begun screaming inside the camper. 
 (O.S.) I want my daddy! Charles backs up, continuing to address Russell -- 
 I'm backing away... I'm backing away... 
 (O.S.) I want my daddy! I want my daddy! Charles joins Sona.   Re:   Russell -- 
 Someone give the geek his Ritalin. 
 At least he's doing his job. Which is more than I can say for some people. 
 (O.S.) I want my daddy! I want my daddy! Sona tosses Charles a roll of duct tape. 
 Tape her up and gag her. As Vanessa continues to SCREAM, Charles moves to the van, unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it. Then opens the door. And... Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his waist. 
 I want my daddy! I want my daddy!    I want my daddy! 
 Get the hell off me. He pries loose her arms from around him. Keeping a grip on her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face away from him. He's about to start duct-taping her wrists. 
 ... Waste of time... I can think of a better way of shutting you up -- Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads.   Charles howls in pain and lets her go. Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper. 
 Shit. (yells to Sona) She got the key! 
 ANGLE - CAMPER takes off. The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't see where she's going. But she's going. 
 Delicious Daria. 
 'Sup, Odion? 
 Long time no see. Then, checking her out -- 
 Like cognac. Just getting better. (then) So what brings you around? 
 ... Sometimes you need an old friend, y'know? 
 Got trouble? 
 ... With a capital 'T.' 
 Tony Fait? Thought you and him were tight. Bonnie and Clyde. 
 Used to be that way. Not treating me right these days. The kid's all he cares about. 
 ... What do you want me to do? 
 ... Man, I don't know. Probably nothing you can do. I just 
 Nah, hey, hold up. It's okay. 
 Back in the day... Just always seemed like you and I had something special between us. 
 Didn't know you thought so. 
 I always cared for you, Odion. That's why I'm here. 
 ... You looking for a job? 
 I need something. 
 ... So maybe you could work here. 
 Here?... Oh, man, I don't know. 
 You were the best. Not many girls pulling in two g's a night. 
 Yeah, but it's been a while for that... Might not remember how. 
 Just like a bicycle, baby.     You don't forget that stuff. Daria considers it a moment. 
 Don't know how Jump'd feel about it. Having me back. 
 Hey, you let me worry about Jump, 
 ... Just talk? Odion's drinking her in. 
 ... No. 
 They have boxing matches in the day? 
 Not exactly boxing. More dangerous. No gloves. No rules. Big money. Very illegal... Started holding 'em during the daytime to fool the cops. 
 The man you remembered -- how do you know he will be here? 
 I don't. But Chambers owns the operation, so I figure it's a good place to start. (then) This is it. They turn into... 
 How will you recognize him? 
 I didn't see his face.   But I'll know his pinkie ring when I  see it. Ten carats. Round cut with   square mount. Good color and clarity.   I remember thinking what it would  do to my face if he hit me. OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to help disguise himself... 
 How do we get in? 
 Leave that to me. Then, to the Guard -- 
 Hey, man, how you doing? Got a fighter here I want to enter. Su shoots him a surprised look. 
 My man's gonna put the rest of these bums to beddy-bye. He'll go in there and get all Chinese on 'em -- the teeth are gonna fly, the blood's gonna run... Gonna be fun. 
 Whatever... You're number twelve, Bruce. He hands a card reading "12" to Su. As Archie and Su make their way toward the arena -- 
 I didn't come here to fight. 
 You won't have to. That was just to get us in. 
 Good day, over a million dollars'll pass hands in here. 
 Find the ring. 
 Yeah.    Okay. He looks around.      Lotta African-American males. 
 Could take a little while. As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands, and Su follows... 
 Sit down. Odion sits. 
 Put on some music. Odion puts a DISC in the STEREO.        Cranks up some HIP-HOP. 
 Nah.    Something slower. Odion SWITCHES MUSIC.        A SLOW TUNE fills the room. 
 That's good... Now just relax... And watch... 
 Tommy. 
 Here come da bug man. 
 Hey.    Howzit? 
 What the hell you doing? 
 Pest control. Don't tell me you didn't get your notice. 
 What notice? 
 See, that burns my ass right to the bone. I mean, hey, I'm here doing my job... Anyway, putting that aside, if you had gotten your notice, you'd know there's a new city ordinance saying all businesses catering to foreigners gotta be sprayed. 
 Yeah?    How come? 
 'Cause foreign people're bringing all 
 We're doing business inside. Can't let you just start hosing the place with bug spray. 
 Yeah, well, maybe you should at least ask the manager about it. 
 Manager's busy. 
 ... Okay. Your call. Just know the city quarantine people'll be here first thing tomorrow. 
 Quarantine people? 
 They'll be shutting you down for non- compliance... Peace out. Tommy starts to go. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Tommy stops. 
 City's really gonna come and close us up? 
 Quicker'n a Zip-loc. 
 ... You sure you're not fucking with me? 
 I'm a licensed exterminator.   Why would I be fucking with you? The Doorman considers it another moment.   Then -- 
 Look. Let's do this. You let me start with a couple small rooms, y'know, offices or something, someplace you don't have customers. Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug bombs, and then we'll do the rest later. How's that? The Doorman considers a moment.     Then -- 
 ... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and come on. 
 ... Look.   At.   This. 
 Just do your thing and go, bro. 
 Roger that. He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT.     He sets off one. PFFFT. The other. As he goes -- 
 Just keep the door closed and be sure to give this shit a full hour before anyone comes in. OFF the closing door... 
 Safe. He kneels.     Removes a desk panel.   And... There it is.     The safe is small but highly secure. 
 Take it down. Miles finishes assembling a Barrett .50 caliber rifle. A big gun. Opens an ammo box labeled "Depleted Uranium. .50 cal." 
 Even with the music, they're gonna hear it when I fire this tank buster. 
 Daria.   Get ready to move. (then) 
 What was that? 
 'Sometimes you need an old friend'... He steps toward Daria.    Backhands her.   Hard.   Then opens the door. A CHAMBERS MAN outside the door addresses Odion. 
 It came from the office. 
 Watch her.   Don't let her leave. Odion goes. The Man enters. Shuts the door, leering at Daria, who starts putting on what she's taken off. 
 Not here? 
 They're here.    Somewhere else. 
 What're you talking about? 
 I'm telling you, they're here. 
 What're we gonna do? 
 Everyone out. Fait's started searching the room.       Tearing it apart. 
 What about you? 
 I gotta save Vanessa.     I gotta find 'em. 
 I'm not leaving you. 
 Yes, you are.    Go.   Now. Someone starts RATTLING the LOCKED DOOR.      Fait doesn't stop. 
 T. Come on, man. They're outside. Give it up. 
 Shut up and get the fuck outta here! That's an order! Miles hesitates. Fait's unreachable. Chambers' men are trying to break down the door. Miles goes. Out the window. Onto the ascender-descender. And gone. 
 ... Y'know, I got the big one... Her response is a front kick to the head. Followed by a spin kick, knocking him out. Then, stepping past him -- 
 Keep it in your pants. 
 ... If you're willing to pay five, you're willing to pay ten. 
 CHAMBERS (CONT'D) You're    willing to pay ten, you're willing    to pay twenty. Twenty, forty.     Forty, eighty... I'm not selling    till I know exactly where the ceiling    is. Whereupon we see who he's talking to:     Ling. 
 You like foreplay? LING How much money do you want for the stones? 
 I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up drills -- girl's gotta get in there and be ready to score points. Bring it straight to the motherfucking hoop. You understand? (beat) So, instead of us going back and forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for you to think of a number. A very high number. A very final number. A number so high and final it'll get me off good, bam, right when I hear it. Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time.       Still isn't looking. Forks up some lobster meat. When... 
 Okay, okay... Ling stops. 
 Ain't worth my life... I'll take the five and call it a game. 
 ... By the way, when we do find him, what then? 
 I'll handle it. In the cage, a fight has just ended. The loser's unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning airplane propeller. The winner doesn't look much better. 
 Seven advances, eleven's out... Next up, eight versus twelve. Eight versus twelve. Fighters report to the cage. As Archie and Su continue the search -- 
 You're after the stones, too, huh? No response from Su.   Beat. 
 ... I did some more checking around to see what anyone knows about 'em... Guess who get back to me? My Defense Department connection. Now, I think he's calling me about this surplus F- 14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands on. But no. Turns out he's calling to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan about black stones -- In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the midget calls out -- 
 Number twelve! 
 (to Su) -- only they're not jewels -- 
 Number twelve! 
 They're -- Suddenly, seeing the "12" card in Su's hand, a FIGHT CLUB FAN grabs his arm and raises it. Yells out -- FIGHT CLUB FAN Twelve's right here! Su pulls his arm back. FIGHT CLUB FAN I'd be scared of him, too. Su glances into the ring, seeing the BRUISER for the first time. The Bruiser's beckoning. 
 Let's go, chickenshit! Su waves them off. 
 Not today... The catcalls start.    Archie leans into Su. 
 I know it    wasn't the plan. But if you don't    fight, they're gonna toss us out on    our asses. We might never find the    guy. 
 #1 He's pretty beat up. 
 Yeah. Fell down the stairs... Enjoy the jail sex, Fait. As they continue up the stairs -- 
 #2 Better have the E.M.T.s look at his head. 
 We're still here to help you, T. 
 Anything you want us to do? 
 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 still checking out the hands of African-American men in the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it. 
 Number eight's on his feet.    Moving in again.   When... 
 Suddenly, he sees it.    The ring. 
 dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight. Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows. 
 You win. Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's path. 
 No quitting.    Get back in there. Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the cage. Where... It's now Su against them all. 
 MOTO-RIDER #1 Looking good. She ignores them.     To each other, so she can hear -- 
 MOTO-RIDER #2 Nice rack. 
 MOTO-RIDER #1 Like the upstairs, like the basement, 
 Shut up, assholes... 
 He's all patched up. 
 #1 Let's go. Fait stands.     Starts out.   Into his mike -- 
 Get ready to move. And we see... The handcuffs aren't on him anymore. 
 Fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand. To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on -- 
 Get the car.     Stay close. As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into the bed of the truck. Jumps on the ATV. IGNITION. The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening. 
 MOTO-RIDER #1 Hey! Too late. Fait blasts out of the rear of the truck.   Right through the nylon mesh tailgate. 
 MOTO-RIDER #1 Don't let that fucker get away! The Moto-Rider FIRES UP the MOTORCYCLE. Drops it into first. Dittoes Fait's leap out the back and SCREAMS off in pursuit. 
 (V.O.) ... We go now to this breaking story... ANGLE TO INCLUDE TV Airing a chopper shot tracking Fait on the ATV. 
 (V.O.) ... You're watching a man on an all- terrain vehicle leading police in a high-speed chase through downtown Los Angeles. An L.A.P.D. spokesman says the man, Anthony Fait -- Vanessa looks over in surprise. 
 (V.O.) -- commandeered the A.T.V. after escaping from police officers while being treated at a local hospital for injuries resulting from his earlier arrest for robbery... And this is certainly one of the wildest chases we've witnessed here in L.A... 
 Yo. 
 Here. 
 Above ground parking garage in Chinatown? 
 Know it. 
 Get there. 
 (V.O.) ... And it looks like this chase will end here, as police seal off the building... OFF Vanessa, watching... 
 Where is he? 
 Decided to leave early. 
 Where'd he go? 
 Right here. Su looks inside the car. 
 ANGLE - CAR Where Archie sits atop the man with the diamond pinkie ring. Holding a STUN GUN to the guy's cheek. 
 Good thing I brought my stunner. He ZAPS the air.    Then puts it back to the guy's cheek. 
 Okay, bud, wanna start the Q and A? 
 (V.O.) ... Here's a car coming down the exit ramp... We see the police approach the car. 
 (V.O.) ... The police apparently talking to the driver... The police let the car pass. 
 (V.O.) ... Now letting this car drive on as the search inside continues... 
 I knew the stones were in there. 
 Question is, how do we get 'em out? Place is slamming nonstop. A long beat.    Fait doesn't answer. 
 Something isn't right. 
 Yeah.   That's what I'm getting. 
 The doorman. 
 ... Where the hell is he? (then) Everyone stay put. OFF which, as he and Su go -- 
 No Chambers' guys.     I don't get it. They reach the closed office door, where they stop and listen. Hear nothing. Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look.     Then Su opens the door. 
 I get it now. Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain, where he reaches into the water and begins searching the rocks lining the bottom. Beat. Then -- 
 Are they there? Su doesn't answer, still searching. 
 No. This can't fucking happen.      They gotta be there. Another beat. Then, at last, Su holds something up:         one black stone. It takes Fait a moment to understand. 
 ... What?     That's it? 
 The rest are gone. 
 ... What the hell happened?        Who got 'em? 
 ... Ling. 
 How do you know? 
 I know. 
 ... How'd he get here before us? 
 He's good. Beat.   Failure.       Summed up in one word: 
 Vanessa... (then, trying) He has the stones. There's      no reason to keep her. Hell, she's a      little girl, she's eight years old     -- she can't hurt him. He can let      her go... He can just fucking let her     go... Su just looks at him.        Not a chance.   And he knows Fait knows it, too. It's over.     For Fait, it's as if his life just ended. 
 ... What the hell am I gonna do? 
 ... We need to go. Fait doesn't move. Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage, and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of exotica, destroying it. Beat.   Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes.          Then -- 
 Come on. OFF which, as Su mobilizes him, and they go... 
 Good. I don't have to baby-sit much longer. 
 I hate kids. LING Is everything else ready? 
 We just have to test the device. Russell, who's been working on his scientific contraption nearby, speaks up. 
 Dye master oscillator. And not test, calibrate. Which I'm now ready to do... Goggles. When the goggles are on, Russell hits a switch.   And... Inside the contraption, brilliant green laser BEAMS begin bombarding a sensor. OFF which... 
 ... I lost the stones. Ling has them... I don't know where he is... I have no way to find him... What do you want me to do? Under which, the PHONE begins to RING.    And... Fait's too upset to care about answering. 
 ... Answer, Daddy, answer... 
 CLOSEUP - PHONE "Low Batt"... "Low Batt"... 
 Want me to get that? Which finally mobilizes Fait to reach over and answer. 
 Hello. INTERCUT WITH: 
 Daddy? 
 Vanessa! Which gets everyone's attention. 
 Come get me!   Please!   I want to go home! 
 Okay, baby, okay. Just calm down. Under which, in b.g., Su quickly ends the phone call to his superior. Still in Chinese -- 
 I'll call you back. 
 (continuing, to Vanessa) Where are you? 
 I don't know. I'm in a van inside a big building. They painted the windows. I can't look out. 
 Try.   Try to see something. Vanessa puts her eye to the window.    Finally finds a small gap in the paint. 
 VANESSA'S POV Few details. Just some chairs and bright green light from Russell's contraption. 
 I see chairs.    And there's green light. Fait repeats for the others' benefit. 
 You see chairs and green light? Where's the light coming from? 
 I can't tell. 
 Is it bright? 
 The green light, baby -- is it bright? 
 Yeah.   Really, really bright. 
 (to Su) It's real bright. 
 Daddy, hurry!    I'm scared! 
 I know, baby.    Just hang in there 
 ... Daddy?!   Daddy?!... END INTERCUT. 
 ... Vanessa?... Vanessa!... Shit! Fait slams the phone down in frustration. But Su's mind is on what she told them. 
 ... He's doing it here.    Tonight. 
 What? 
 Selling the stones... A dye laser emits green light. He needs it to activate them. 
 What the hell you talking about? 
 What are these stones? Archie answers it. 
 Doomsday in disguise. All eyes go to him. 
 They're some kinda new synthetic plutonium. Small and portable, but mega-powerful. 
 This fucker's making bombs? 
 Not making them. 
 Yeah, he'd need a big operation for that. Why bother? Just demonstrate the stones work and sell 'em to whichever international scumbag offers the highest bid. He makes millions, they make the bombs, then... 'look out, world.' 
 ... Okay, so we know what he's up to. How's it get us to Vanessa? Su considers it a moment. 
 The buyers will want to arrive and leave quickly... Somewhere private... Accessible by aircraft. 
 Vanessa said she's inside a big building. Could be a hangar. 
 Man, there's dozens of little airports around here. We'd never get to 'em all. 
 ... Flight plans. 
 Hey, yeah. Flight plans show destinations. All aircraft file 'em with the Aviation Administration. If we could get a list, we could maybe figure out where the sale's going down. 
 ... Daria, call the aviation people. Use our L.A.P.D. credentials. We need flight plan info for all private aircraft in this area tonight... Everyone else get ready to move... Miles, the no-gun policy's revoked. You break out the heat... Tommy, you gotta get us a diversion. 
 I can help with that. 
 ... Do it all fast. 
 We're operational. The others remove their goggles.    Sona checks her watch. 
 The buyers arrive in less then an hour. Beat.   Ling holds up a black stone and examines it. LING ... So small. So deadly... We're selling conscience for money... A look at the others.   Serious.   Then a broad smile of 
 (O.S.) Wick Airfield... PULL BACK TO... 
 ... Five private choppers arriving tonight within minutes of each other. 
 Sounds like our best shot. 
 .. It better be, or my baby's dead. He and Su exchange a look.     Then -- 
 Let's go. 
 (V.O.) So tell me... How the hell's Taiwan fit into all this? 
 (V.O.) One of our scientists made the stones. Tried to go into business for himself. We stopped him. Recovered the stones... Ling betrayed us. He took them. 
 (V.O.) Ling?   He was one of you? 
 (V.O.) We were partners. Six of us. He killed the others. He thought he killed me, too. 
 (V.O.) (beat) So what're you really after -- the stones or the payback? 
 
 (V.O.) ... Yeah... Let's get it all. 
 LING (CONT'D) But nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle... But what if it weren't?... That's the question that brought you here tonight... And here's the answer. Ling holds up a single stone. LING In its present state, it's completely inert. Zero radiation, zero volatility... Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a table. Folds the velvet over. Then, whack, hits it hard with a mallet. He unfolds the velvet.   The stone's smashed to pieces. Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then inserts the capsule into his contraption. 
 Goggles on. Everyone puts on goggles. Then Russell hits the switch, and the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver of stone, which begins to glow. Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical readout on the contraption races up the scale -- 
 ... Firecracker... .44 magnum... R.P.G... Sidewinder... SCUD... Tomahawk... Daisy Cutter... Hiroshima... two Hiroshimas... And it just keeps going.   Until, finally -- 
 ... New World Order. As the buyers absorb this... 
 Goggles off. Russell removes the capsule and hands it back to Ling, who holds it up. LING One small    fragment. Transformed into a source    of immense energy. More powerful    than weapons-grade plutonium a hundred    times its size. A beat as this sinks in. 
 The purpose of today's sale is to begin trading a new commodity on the black market and establish its value... There are fifty stones available in the first sale. The opening price is one million per stone... Bids, please? The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. At the same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators. Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market- analysis for Sona to consult. The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel out the situation. 
 Five at one million. Sona is silent.   Silence means "No." 
 Five at one-point-two. Silence. 
 Three at two million. 
 
 Six at one-five. Silence. 
 Ten at two million. Silence. 
 Miles, what do you see? 
 (V.O.) Two sentries my side. Then, scanning inside Ling's hangar THROUGH windows -- 
 (V.O.) Sale's at this end... There's a camper with painted windows. Middle of the hangar. 
 Vanessa said she was in a van. That's gotta be it. (to Daria) When we get her, you move her outta 
 I'll keep her safe. 
 Eight at three. Silence. 
 Nine at three. Silence. 
 Ten at three-one. 
 We'll take that... There are now thirty-seven stones available. And now, in more and more rapid-fire succession -- 
 Five at three-five. 
 Eight at three-five. 
 Twenty at three. 
 Miles.   Sentries. 
 is already sighted in.   PULLS the TRIGGER.   PHUT! 
 One Ling killer takes a leg hit and goes down. Before the second killer has time to react, he catches a BULLET in the shoulder. 
 
 Done. 
 Tommy and Archie. Watch out for the camper. Punch it. 
 Five at five million. 
 Six at five. 
 Seven at five. 
 Ten at five. 
 Ten at five-one. 
 Five-two. When suddenly... KA-WHAM! Archie's Abrams TANK BLASTS through a wall and into the hangar. Archie's head pops out of the driver's hole. At the same time, Tommy pops up out of the turret and trains a mounted machine gun on the stunned group. 
 Freeze, motherfuckers! 
 I knew it!   I knew it! 
 VANESSA'S POV Charles is drawn away by the advancing tank. 
 (V.O.) Vanessa's out of the camper.   Running this way. 
 Stay. And he's gone, sprinting after her just as... 
 reaches a button for opening and closing the giant hangar doors. She jabs a button, and the nearest door begins to motor open. 
 hears the OPENING HANGAR DOOR.    Turns.   Sees Vanessa and goes after her. 
 (V.O.) She's out. Then, FINDING Charles coming after her -- 
 (V.O.) There's a guy after her. 
! 
 SHOOTS again.   PHUT! 
 The BULLET RICOCHETS off the PAVEMENT right next to him. In a flash, he's up and running. Heading out into the darkness of the airfield after Vanessa. Meanwhile, back inside... 
 Just be cool! At which point, Russell breaks for his five-ton truck. 
 I said don't move, motherfucker! Russell just keeps going. Slides open the side door in the back of the five-ton, revealing... A twin-fifty machine gun. Two barrels, .50 caliber. Dangerous even for a tank. Russell vaults in and takes aim. 
 Fucking amateurs! He starts FIRING. People start running. .50 CAL. ROUNDS take big CHUNKS out of whatever they hit. 
 Shit!   What do we do? 
 Shoot back! 
 How? The question's answered for him.   He somehow does the right thing. And... Tommy's MACHINE GUN begins RIPPING CHUNKS out of the FIVE- TON and EVERYTHING near it. Tommy's a horrible shot; the gun's more in control of him. But... Russell finally dies under a HAIL of HEAVY LEAD. 
 Twin .50's some major firepower. How'd that little shit get one? 
 Motherfucker.    Couldn't fucking listen. INTERCUT WITH which... 
 Ling and Sona are moving toward the limo. Ling has the stones. When... Su is there. Blocking the way. Sona attacks. Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back. Never taking his eyes off Ling. When... Sona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns the gun on Su. Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su... Su sees 
 Don't let him get away! 
 Ling's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH HOLES in the. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as the TANK CRUSHES the. INTERCUT WITH which... 
 Get him. Su goes after Ling. And now it's Daria vs. Sona. Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her side. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the Scorpion. She swings it up. And... Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the SCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips through her chest and kills her. And now, here's what's been going on outside... 
 
 The BULLET knocks his gun from his hands.    Charles is slowed but keeps going. 
 sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and Vanessa.     He comms Fait. 
 Lost 'em behind the gas truck. 
 stops behind the gas truck.   Looks around for Vanessa.    No sign of her. Until... Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all the way. He whips it open. And... There's Vanessa, hiding inside. Charles grabs her.   Yanks her out struggling and kicking. 
 Time to end this my way. And then... 
 (O.S.) Drop the girl. 
 Put her down. Charles lowers Vanessa to the ground.    He releases her. 
 Daddy! Vanessa runs to her father. Dives into his arms. It's a little more energetic than Fait was expecting. And... 
 comms Fait. 
 No shot. 
 Don't move. Fait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat the living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion. The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until... A mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is unconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over Charles. Tosses the chocks down. 
 Wrong kid.    Wrong dad. 
 The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into the bottom of the chopper. In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold. 
 Shoot it down!   Now! And then... Su lets go.      Drops fifteen feet to the ground. As... Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta. 
 Can you hit it? 
 No problem.   Absolutely... Load. Tommy slides a shell into the breech. 
 
 The Agusta's tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON SHELL. 
 Shot him right in the ass. 
 I did it.   I can't believe it. 
 Thought you said it was no problem. 
 What do I know? 
. The spilled fuel ignites.    A circle of intense fire.   With Su in the middle. The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside. Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones. Su is waiting. LING 
 ... I won't.    You will What happens next happens in an instant: Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms.   Wrenches it. A direction it can't go. Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP. Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from Ling's pocket. And... Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags, choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror- stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment. Then, inBTITLED Chinese -- 
 This is for our friends. And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that... 
 We got it all. (then) What happens to the stones? 
 They'll be destroyed. They see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive in b.g. 
 Looks like I'll be doing some jail time. 
 Jail? Man, you just helped save the planet. Law's gotta allow for that. A look between Fait and Su.   Su nods. 
 I'll do what I can. 
 That's good, 'cause I mean, we make a helluva team, y'know? (to Su) Well, not you, 'cause you're law enforcement. But the rest of us -- look, a white guy comes in handy now and then. Y'know, if you're pulling a job in Beverly Hills or ripping off a country club or whatever... What kind of percentage are we talking? 
 We're not. Fait looks at Vanessa again.     Finding a new purpose in her eyes. Beat. 
 Time I got real. He regards the others. 
 Time we all did. 
 Get real?    What's that mean? 
 ... Means we're through with that life. Fait's eyes meet Tommy's.     Beat.   Tommy nods. Fait looks to Daria for her answer. 
 I'm with you, T. He looks to Miles. 
 Whatever you say, man. Fait looks back to Su.   They hold the look.

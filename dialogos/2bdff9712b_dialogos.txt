 
 
 MUMBLE (VO) You ever feel small? 
 
 
 MUMBLE (VO) Like you're no-one, cos the world is full of us, and everyone's the same 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) How do you stand out from the crowd? How do you find someone special? 
 A 
 MUMBLE (VO) I know. I know. "You sing your heart out." That's how mum found dad in the first place 
 (trying to connect) "Babe...I got you Babe..." 
 (giving it his all) "When a man loves a woman..." 
 "Love me tender love me true, all my dreams fulfil. 
 MUMBLE (VO) With them it was love at first song. 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Apparently I only just made it. 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Afterwards Mum went off to the sea to keep warm. Dad stayed home like dad's do, incubating. 
 Safe home baby.... 
 WISHFUL (CONT'D) I'll miss you. 
 MUMBLE (VO) Tell me what it is about the cold and the dark. Soon as the sun goes away, everyone gets religious 
 When all others leave... 
 We Remain. 
 When the Sun vanishes... 
 We Remain. 
 Deny the pangs of hunger. Seal the gaps. Share the warmth.... 
 MUMBLE (VO) Caruso's the leader because he's so incredibly old. Some say more than 40, but you know how penguins exaggerate. 
 ....Each one taking his turn to defy the wind. 
 ÜBERPENGUIN. 
. ...As we invoke the Great One, Penguin of Penguins 
 (pushing back inside) OK. Invoke. But keep moving 
 MUMBLE (VO) My dad was never that devout. Often his mind was on other stuff. 
 J. (Sings) "I wanna be loved by you, alone and nobody else by you boo boo pee doo" 
 Amen to that honey 
 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, pal! Ya lettin' out the heat! 
 ...Quit shovin'! ...Hey watch where you're putting your feet 
 Brothers, BROTHERS! The Devotions! 
 Oh no! I dropped it! Where's my egg! 
 WISHFUL (CONT'D) S'okay. S'okay. No harm done. 
 MUMBLE (VO) I guess he was wrong about a lot of things. 
 But I did learnt this from him:    the power of positive thinking 
 By the power of our Devotions... 
 We turn the world once more. 
 By our devotion to the Wisdoms 
 We bring back the sun. 
. 
 ...It's   a   boy! ...It's   a   girl! ...What   a   peach! ...What   a   bruiser!

 Well, how about that? 
 Whoa li'l buddy, slow down!

 Get him to do it again Daddy 
 Shh. Quiet 
 We Wait 
 Any day now. 
 (sings) a wiggle when she walks, a giggle when she talks, makes my world go round.... 
 WISHFUL (CONT'D) (sharply) Hey. Thought I told you not to do that 
 Well tell em don't. 
 `Cos it ain't penguin. 
 Everyone's hungry son. The mommas are bringing fish soon. 
 You'll see it when she brings one 
 ...Wives-ho! Wives-ho! ...Hubba-hubba! Wives-ho! ...Better late than never. 
 ...Barbra-Ann! ...Peggy Sue! (MORE) (CONTINUED) 10. CONTINUED: (CONT'D) ...Hey Paula! ...Roxanne!! 
 
 J.?! 
#1 You're not as fat as I thought you'd be. 
#1 It was pretty slim pickings. Something's happened I tell you 
#2 Even the squid were hard to get We had to swim forever 
#3 Everyone split up. A lot of the gals never made it back. 
 #2 ...Delilah? 
 #3 ...Gloria?! Gloria??! 
 Since my baby left me. I found a new place to dwell. Down the bottom of lonely street at heartbreak hotel 
 WISHFUL (CONT'D) Woah I'm so lonely baby. I'm so lonely baby. I'm so lonely I could... 
 J.

 (overcome) O Honey. O Baby. You made it! 
 WISHFUL (CONT'D) You hurt?

 J But who's this. 
 I called him Mumble. 
 J Just a little krill that's all 
 Later, bud. Give your ma time to regurgitate 
 J Aw. But isn't he just a darling? 
!! 12. 
 MUMBLE (VO) After that, with food being so scarce everyone was busy busy busy. Mom and dad were working so hard I didn't see much of them. Besides I had school to go to. 
 Settle class. Settle. We will begin with the most important lesson you will ever learn. Now does anyone know what that is? 
 TEACHER (CONT'D) Michael? 
 Don't eat yellow snow? 
 True but, that's not it. Mumble? 
 Anyone else? 
 It's our Heartsong, Miss. 
 Your Heartsong. Yes. The melody you hear inside, the thing that makes you different from every other penguin. So. Let's all be very still now and listen. And when you hear your song, let it come out. Who's first. 
 Me! Me! I've got one! (sings) "I can't get no...satisfaction.... I can't get no...girly action..." 
 Well Michael, if you think that's really you. What have you got for us, Ella? 
 (sings) Voulez-vous coucher avec moi...ce soir? 
 Well Mumble...perhaps you can do better 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Bim bam-a-loolah a bim bam bom 
 You heard that in there? 
 Dear, that's not even a tune. 
 No, a tune is like... (she sings a scale) La la la la la la la la. 
 (getting worried) Listen carefully, Mumble. La la la la la la la la!! 
 (emphatically) La La La La La La La La! 
 (sotto) It's bizarre. I don't understand it. Did anything happen - you know...- during early development? 
 J. No. All fine. Normal incubation, wasn't it honey? 
 Well Yeah, it was a kinda...a tough winter I guess, and he did hatch a little late, but... (at a loss.) Is there really nothing we can do? 
 Of course there is. Thats why we have Mrs Astrakhan. 
'S 
 CAN'T SINK? Rubbeesh. Every little pengvin has a sonk. Vhen I have feenished, your singink vill be givink everyone the goosepeempel. 
 So. Closink the eyes. Liftink chin. Deep breathe here in the downbelow. Now...most important part, find a feelink. Happy feelink, sad feelink, maybe lonely feelink. 
 Don't think EET!! Feel eet! Through the whole body, from the beak right down to tippy-toes. 
 The feet. The jiggy-jog. Don't do eet. Do not move muscle. Rigid like plank, like board. NO 
!!! Now...calm. Remember the feelink. 
 And be spontanuous. 
 Not with the feet, with the sonk! You vant to meet beautiful girl? You vant to make the Egg? 
 Well singk! "Ba Ba Bleckship, tvinklestar...La la la la la la, la". 
 Hokay. Enough. Stop. Hokay! Ve go back to the top. Forget the body, look inside the soul. No notes, no sonk, only feelink. Happy feelink. Sad feelink. Enormous feelink, so enormous it fills the whole body. It must escape or you explode! Now, open your leetle beak... 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) I couldn't face the class in this mood So I just kept going. 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Looking for what? I don't know? A different type of penguin? 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) And that's exactly what I found. 
 Hey, whacha doin' dere flipperbird? 
#1 Oh we just dropped in for a spota lunch. Hey hey hey...

 Interesting you should ask? 
 No! No! Don't startim on that! 
 Shaddap! The flipperbird aksed me a question. (fixing Mumble with a crazy bloodshot eye.) I got two words for ya: "Alien Abduction".

 Quiet ya ignorant morons! (to Mumble) ...a lotta folks don't believe this but ...dere's somet'in out dere. Creatures. Not like us. Bigger...Fiercer...smarter, too.

Dey probe me, dey tiemeup and strapmedown...dey take dis pointy t'ing and stick it inta me! Den...blackout! 
 Gets worse! I woke up and there's dis thing on me! (the leg band) Go home and every flyinbird starts dissin' me: `Hey Yellaleg'`What's happenin' Whats that on your leg, Yellaleg?' It was humiliatin'!! 
 True. I guess my cries for mercy appealed to their better nature. 
 Nice try kid. But No... 
 ...Come on, out witcha! ...Ya sneaky-ass flipperbird! 
 SKUAS (CONT'D) ...Great, Yellaleg. ...What did we tell ya ...ya leddim geddaway, dincha with ya screwy alientalk. 
 Hey, Don't peck me or I'll peck you and when I peck you know you've been pecked...(fade) 
 MUMBLE (VO) Compared with that, school almost seemed like fun 
 
 Graduates, today you leave the safety of our community for the first time, forsaking the trusted solid ice for the terrible magic of the deep. 
 MUMBLE (VO) Caruso. He couldn't help himself. 
. Things are not as they were. For five years now we have known nothing but famine. But you are our hope. Upon your survival depends the very future of the entire Penguin Nation. Dive deep, swim far. May the Great Penguinus go with you. And remember... 
 Excelsi-yah! Yah yah yah! 
 Excelsi-yah ! Yah yah yah! 24.

 Hombre, you got so much already, you dangerous. 
 Yow! 
 
 
 
 ...Where's the tall-boy ...I thought he was with you. 
 
 Ramos! 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Guys!    I want to speak to you. 40. 
 ...Forget it ...We're not going back there ...Never 
 ...Maybe its got a brother still alive. 
 Okay. Okay. Here's the plan: we go and ask the revered one. 
 LOVEDAY'S MOUND 
. 
 First, the devotion... 
 LOVEDAY (CONT'D) A moment... (composing himself) ... and your question? 
 The Mystic Beings are speaking to me. Yes! She is alive and happy and you are in her thoughts... 
 One pebble, one question. Next! 
 LOVEDAY (CONT'D) I sense...you are the one with the question. 
 ...How does he do it? ...He just one look and he know. 
 A little nervous? That's normal. Take your time. 
 No time wasters. Next! 
 ...Skua? Leg? What's he talking about? 
 (starts to wheeze and cough) Listen friend, this is my Sacred Talisman, bestowed upon me by the Mystic Beings... 
 ...during my Epic Journey of Enlightenment to the Forbidden Shore! 
 I hear them. They talk to me all the time I am their instrument. They chose me to...... 
 Enough! How many questions is that? You don't have enough pebbles. 
 SILENCIO!! The Mystic Beings are speaking. They say show some respect stranger. Especially to the One who Knows. 
 LOVEDAY (CONT'D) The reason there are not enough fish is simple: There is not enough love in the world. Love is the answer! 
 LOVEDAY (CONT'D) (over this) Okay, everybody, turn around to the penguin next to you and give them a great big hug. Comeon, everybody...hug! This is a safe place. 
 LOVEDAY (CONT'D) Now. The Mating Season starts today so here's what everybody should do: go forth and multiply! If you'll excuse I myself must retire for a moment to the couch of indulgence... okay ladies, who's gonna be first 
 ..Me Loveday. ..Me! ..No Me ! 
 One at a time! And don't touch the Talisman! 
 ....I liked him better when he was just plain Pedro. ...Did he say it starts today ...why didn't someone tell us. ...We gotta get to work guys!! 
 ...How many rocks you got. 
 ...Forget `em honey. They only one between the six of them...and they just spent it. 
 (getting desperate) Wait. Look. 
 ...You like it ...Arriba! ...What do you need stones for 
 Try sitting on the ice for a month. It might come to you Salsa Boy. Come on, Consuela. 
 Gotta be some rocks left here somewhere! (to Mumble) Hey big guy, got any love stones over where you come from? 
 ...Easy as that? ...So why aren't you over there? 
 Man. You're an emperor all right, You're a king among emperors. The singing we can fix. 
 No problem. Which way's this colony of yours? 
 ...We'll all come. ...Yeah I like em tall. ...You jus' gotta do exac'ly as I say. 
 Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Voulez-vous coucher avec moi? 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Oh, and I want her so badly How can I tell her I love her? Yes I would give my heart gladly (MORE) 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) But each day when she walks to the sea, She looks straight ahead not at me...." 
 Mumble? 
 Tall and tanned and young and lovely.. 
 Mumble, that's just cheap 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) I'm sorry. 
 (shakes her head, tearful) When you left without saying goodbye I thought something had happened, then I thought he just doesn't care. 
 And then when I saw you singing, for a second I thought... 
 I know. I know. Its impossible. 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Sing something to this! 
 (her back to him) What's the point. It's embarrassing 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Okay, that'll work. Just keep it going. 
 (bellows) STOP...THIS...DEPRAVITY!!! 
 CARUSO (CONT'D) WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS 
?!! 
 Happy WHAT?! This is an OUTRAGE! 
. It is exactly this kind of disrespectful, heretic behaviour that has brought the Scarcity upon us! Don't you see...we are being brought to account by the Forefathers! 
 ...then what did?! 
 (pushing in) ...He has abandoned the faith. ...He has driven the fish away. 
 Don't touch me! Heathen!! 
 A No, Son they're right. 
 Truth is, I'm the cause of it. I dropped the egg. I made you how you are. If only you'd come back to us, relinquish the dark side 
 Just do it. Pray to the Forefathers for forgiveness. 
 Wait! Mumble! 
 Can you live without it? 
 ELLA (CONT'D) I believe in you, Mumble. But without the huddle we can't make an egg. Without the egg, what are we here for? 
 ...True ...That's a big question 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) OK. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to talk an alien. I'm going to find what's causing the shortage 
 But what about?... 
 But... 
 But... 
 "Together we stand" 
 ALL (CONT'D) Recite the Wisdoms! 
 ALL (CONT'D) "In the Wisdoms we trust." 
 "When all others leave..." 
 Louder. More fervent bretheren. "When the Sun vanishes..." 
 Tell me again where we're going. 
 How do we know where they live. 
 
 ...Not so close. We got babies on board 
 ...Wow. Does nesting make em touchy 
 Why don't he speak? 
 ...He's possessed! ...It's a seizure! 
 Any better? 
 ...Well to me that's gotta be bestowing. 
 ...No way. No. He's the revered one ...He speaking symbolically. 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) But this thing was made by someone. And if we find them, they could take it off. 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) So where do we Go, Loveday 
 Oh my! Now he thinks he's an Elephant Seal 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) ...In the land of the Elephant Seals!!? 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) ...Beyond the land of the Elephant Seals!!? 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) So who's coming 
 Oi 
 A 
 ...Stop. Enough. We must've gone past it ...Past? Don't kid me. We're not even close. 
 Well I guess we're about to find out 
 1 (big-bellied, booming southern voice) Well roll me over and call me a dugong. What the heck have we got here 
 2 Sure. Just git yourselves over them there hills I'd come with you myself but... 
 1 Woah Woah. You aint told em half of it: over them hills, beyond the great glacier, `n' through the blizzard country. 
 2 I heard its forbidden to ask how to get there! 
 2 Mystic Who? 
 1 Blizzard Walkers! Cut you up soon as look at you. 
 2 Cut you up before they look at you. 
 1 Could be!? I heard they'd take a whole penguin, rip its skin right off and turn it into mush. 
 2 Huh! That's a Picnic! I hear tell they'd take a baby seal and club it to death. With their bare clubs. 
 1 Huh! Clubbing's a Clambake! My Granpappy says they been known to skin a seal from snout to tail in a hot second. 
 2 Your Granpappy don't know squat! What I hear they take your sorry carcass, melt you down, burn you up, take your fur `n' fat and turn you into a wide variety of useful items! 
 1 The hell with "useful" Those critters'd y turn you into a food item! Little popsicle things! Ya hear me? One day you're a big ole whale and the next minute, FUNFOOD!! 
 #1 You calling me a liar son? 
 #2 He's calling your grandpappy a liar. And you know what, Maybe he's right. 
#1 Why you. Flop over here and say that! 
 (running to catch up) ...Go where? ...didn't you hear what he said ...Its Forbidden 
 Stop! I'm hearing voices. The mystical guys. They say: "Your life is perfectly good as it is...forget this stupid mission". 
 Ramon. That was embarrassing, man. 
 ...No, no. This can't be right! ...It was better the other way. 
 ....The way I feel": the "frostbitten" shore ....So what are those black things?. 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Hello!! 
 Maybe they invisible. 
 What is that? 
. 
 As long as it's a good whale, not the other kind. 
 What other kind?!! 
 LOVEDAY! LOVEDAY!! 
 
... 
. 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Stop! Please!.... 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) ...It's very important! 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) WE...HAVE...TO...TALK! 
 Mumble. I owe you my life amigo. And I say this because I admire and deeply respect you. If you are thinking what I think you are thinking. You are out of your crazy head 
 You say Hi. Come back and say Hi to her yourself 
 What? 
 You don't think we should go with him 
 ...Don't sweat it Revered One. Many are called, few are chosen. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 68. CONTINUED: 
 ADELIES (CONT'D) ..Hey, how tall you think the Tall Guy was? ...Who could say? Four times my height at least... 
 About this Revered One stuff, you guys 
 Yeah 
 Maybe just call me Pedro 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) HEY YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET AWAY WITH THIS?!! NOT IF I CAN HELP IT YOU SHIT- SQUIRTER ALIEN CREEPS. 
 
 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Too loud! 
 He's looking for a mate, mate. And these days, I tell you they're few and far between 
 ALBATROSS (CONT'D) Talking of which, I never seen a penguin this far out. Watch you don't hit The Convergence mate. 
 Where the cold water meets the warm, mate. Once you cross it, there's no getting' back. What you tryinmg to prove anyway? 
 The who? 
 Them. Fish is just the start of it Mate. Them aliens is the ones who took out the whales. 
 Straight up mate. Biggest creatures ever lived. Decimated, mate. 
 Anywhere and everywhere. Over the sea, under the sea, Jees, I've even seen them fly. The great southland's swarming with em 
 No way mate, he won't go anywhere near `em. And neither should you. 
 ALBATROSS (CONT'D) Don't say I didn't warn you 
 A 
. 72. 
 A 
 MUMBLE (VO) When I finally saw one, the Alien was even more hideous than I'd imagined 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) (terrified) The - fish - are - ours. Understand? 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) We can't live without them! 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Speak Adelie? Skua-talk? 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Oh no! Not the pointy thing! 
 
 
 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Excuse me, where are we. 
 Heaven. Where d'you think? 
 Dunno. Don't care. We got food. We got water. You hear a seal now and then, but you never meet one. Perfect. 
 PENGUIN (CONT'D) Fish! 
 Fish time. Fish time! 
! 
 MUMBLE (VO) Every day after that, it rained fish in the afternoon. 
 
 
 Look Mommy! It's dancing! 
 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) You like that? Well how about this. 
 #1 Oh-Oh, another one gone troppo 
 #2 You think its infectious 
 #3 I sure hope not 
 
 
 MUMBLE (VO Yes. Yes. At last something was happening. I was finally getting through to them! 
 V/O'S ...What's that? ...Where? ...Coming from the Inland! 
 ...Is it a Penguin? ...Is it one of ours? 
 Who wants to know? 
 This is it. I guess 
 ... So Who's this? ...Kinda small for an emperor. ...(suspicious) Where did you say you were from? 
 Mumble?! Its Mumble!! 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) Are these all yours? 
 They're my singing students. 
 Of course not. I was waiting for you. 
 Huh? 
 ...Who's doing all the shouting ...Its Mumble. He's worse than before. 
. You again! And still full of the same old nonsense. 
. Move along everyone. Pay no attention. There's no such thing as aliens 
 So who fixed him up with this. 
. 
 ...Does it hurt? ....Its not made of feathers thats for sure ...what's it gonna do 
 You led them here. Are you crazy!! 
 They'll slaughter us. Head for the sea! 
 Its what they understand. They can't talk, they can't sing. They speak with their feet. Do it. 
. Now look what you've done! 
 ...its the end of the world. ....Its all Mumbles fault. I told you 
 Just do what the kid says. 
 Recite the wisdoms! "Together we stand". "Divided We Freeze". 
 "When all others leave, we Remain 
!! 
 
!! 
 MUMBLE (CONT'D) That's it! Excellent! ¡Riba Riba, penguinos! Shake those hips. Come on, bust a move!! 
. Adhere to the wisdoms!! The Ancients will protect us 
 ....Aliens. ... I never doubted it for a moment 
 More feelink. BE SPONTANUOUS!! 
 (dancing) You know who that is? That's my boy! 
 (dancing) Know him? He ees my star pupol! I TEACH HIM EVERYTHINGK! 
. 
 MUMBLE (VO) From that day on, No one quite knows how it happened, but the black icebergs began to disappear and the fish became abundant once more. 
 A 
 ...So what do you reckon? 
 Yes, quite extraordinary. (stares at the screen) some kind of neurological disorder? a nutritional deficiency perhaps. We'd certainly back the long-term study. 
 And the international treaty? 
#1 Yes. This is exactly the leverage we need for an embargo. No fishing whatsoever...legal, illegal, sanctioned, whatever. 
#2 So we all step up policing of the pirate factory ships. And we pressure that country to stop their so-called `experimental' fishing. 
#3 Yes, if our government asks your government to approach their government to call off their fleet... 
#2 Better if their government hear it from our government via your government... 
 What the heck. The amount of publicity this is generating, they'd have world war three if they didn't stop. 
 
#1 Is there a problem? I thought this one was barren. 
#2 More or less. But one of the stars we're harvesting supports these things here. 
#1 So...? 
#2 Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know about before was these things here 
 VOICE#2 (CONT'D) Just thought you'd want to see them before...you know. 
#1 Hmm.   Charming 
#2 So.    We go ahead. Or...? 
#1 No. Better leave them be. See what sector twelves got to offer instead.

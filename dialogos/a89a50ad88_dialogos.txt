: The screen is black. First we hear the sound of a single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow streets of some old hill village in Sicily. Now, confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us and another, and as our surroundings become more visible, we discover that we are moving through a pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,. suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe. 
 Tony. 
 In you get --- 
 Will. Daddy be at the airport? 
 - as Tom and Tony come up. 
 No. Ere wanted me to tell you both how sorry he was. 
 
 8e sure and give my love to your mother. 
 It isn't like you won't be back from time to time. 
 I' 11 bet we' 11 all. be together for Christmas. Wait and see. Tony gems into the car. He locks out the window to-- ward the house. We begin XXI-N Ti. TZS 2 C 2=17"s 
 Hagen is the last one into the car. As it starts down the driveway on its way to the airport in Reno, Connie, Lampone, Neri and the Housekeeper all wave. The auto- matic gate at the foot of the driveway opens. The Guard at the gate flicks a half-salute as the Limousine passes through. TEE GROUP r n FONT OF EOQSE As the group breaks, Connie and the Housekeeper going back inside, Neri and Lampone drifting off, we pan up- ward to a window in the second-story and zoom in. Michael Corleone has moved the curtain aside with one hand and is looking after the disappearing limousine, his expression unreadable-but somehow sad. 
 SPEAKER' S VOICE our Nation is and has been histor- ically the symbol of freedom, of justice and opportunity and its pecui.iar strength is that no matter what our individual background -- 
 • CRUNDELLIUS' VOICE -- there are no limits to the goals to which we can each legitimately aspire. And now, as an unpopular war is ended in East Asia and we set our sights on new goals, I leave you with the words of another Sailor --- We continue to pull back to discover that we are at the Navy and Marine Corps stadium. It is a late Spring day and in the early-middle Nineteen Seventies. The Midshipmen, their parents and guests, are gathered for- the graduation ceremonies. 
 ' Our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all. To this solemn purpose we call on the young, the brave and the strong, and the free. Heed my call. Come to the sea. Come sail with me.' 
 The speech is over and as the audience applauds, the Superintendent of the Academy crosses an to Grundellius. 
 Trident Scholar Anthony Adams At the sound of his name Tony rises and moves toward- the Speaker's platform. We 
 MIDS$IPMAN I propose three cheers for those about to leave us. Eig hip! (the Brigade answers with a roar)

On the screen Vidal --ousels a kid' s ha..- and crosses into the water. As he wades out, Tony turns to Elizabeth. 
 When will this be shown? 
 Sometime in the Fall. While Elizabeth, in the projection room, is saying this. her image on the screen has turned to the T4 camera and is saying: 
 ELIZABETB'S VOICE This is Elizabeth Ann Dunne coming to you from Finca del Sol where -- in an exclusive interview -- El Presidents, Armando Vidal, has just extended the hand of friendship from quote, 'his little Country to our great Nation . '

 as the Instructor looks around the circle of Officer Trainees and from them chooses Tony. 
 You.. You'd like to kill me, wouldn't you, Sir? Well, here's your chance. The Instructor tosses Tony the knife. Tony catches it. As they circle,. the Instructor taunts Tony. 
 Come on. Come on. Make a move, Sir. Are you falling in love with me? Then do something hostile. Make a face. Stick out your tongue. Do something, Mister Adams. Tony swings the knife. The Instructor avoids him. 
 My little bitty sister can make a better move than that, Six. 
 The Instructor offers a tempting target. Tony swings. The Instructor slaps his cap across Tony's face, grabs Tony's wrist and disarms him, throwing him to the ground. 
 (C^NT? 2IUED ) 
 - All right, Sir. You --- Re breaks off as. Tony has driven an upper cut into the Instructor's balls. The Instructor grabs his groin and goes down in a heap. 
 Tony rolls to his feet, grabs up the killing knife and presses it to the Instrutor's throat. 
 All right you, son of a bitch, tell me about it.. The Instructor is looking at Tony. Suddenly he grins;

 NEWSCASTER'S VOICE Today in Leavenworth, Kansas, one-- time International Brotherhood of Dockworkers' President, Danny DeVito i was. released. on pardon after serving six and. a half years of a fifteen year sentence an embezzlement and conspiracy charges. DeVito didn't state his future plans, but insiders expect him to challenge the incum- bent President, Pat Brady, in the up- coming election. 
 As Tony comes into the room, Palmateer gives him a pen and a couple of pieces of paper. 
 PAL.MATEER A couple of things for you to sign 6 before you go operational. This is for your piece -- 
 (SECOND PAPER) And this is your resignation. It's a technicality, but in case the shit ever really hits the fan, we'd have p to disclaim you. 
 (GRINS) It's called the principal of plaus- ible denial. We never invoke it until the cock crows thrice. As Tony is signing the papers, Palmateer has produced a service automatic from a canvas carryi+:g case. He puts it on the table before Tony --- 
 As a large car pulls up and stops in front of Tony, he opens the door and gets into the backseat. We now might be able to see that F'rankie is driving. With him in the front seat is Santino. In the back- seat is Umberto Croce. INT'. THE L SOUS tNE - DAY as Tony gets in and sits next to Croce. General greetings, then Tony gives the briefcase to Croce. 
' Where to? 
 Take a right on Sixteenth Street. 
 As Croce sets the briefcase on his lap, Tony reaches into his pocket and gives him the key. Now Croce carefully unlocks the briefcase. As this is going on: 
 How's. your progress? 
 Doctor Barcenas is getting an assaS,ilt team together. 
 'Barcenas? 
 
 . Let use of-12 at the next corner. 
 TONY'S VOICE It's all there. 
=O Straight frcm the East Coast Distributor. Tony looks over at Croce: 
 We're in business.

TEE TERRACE ( iYNEL'Y CENT~'R) - NZGET On the broad, impressive terrace, overlooking the curve of the river- as it mirrors the lights of Washington, we find Elizabeth, dressed for evening. She is surrounded by three urbane men, Morton, her Television Producer, Swartzwalder, a Jurist and McKissick, a young Senator. McKissick is lighting Elizabeth's cigarette as Tony comes up with the two drinks. 
 Finally. 
 Thank God for 'the Navy. As she takes her drink: 
 Mister Adams,_ I'd like you to meet Judge Swartzwalder -- Senator McXissick and Jack Morton from wham all blessings flow --- 
 As long as the ratings hold up. As Tony is shaking hands around with the Judge, McKissick turns to Elizabeth: 
 Burning the midnight oil at State?

 Tony has heard this last. 
 You stationed in Washington? 
 On temporary assignment. 
 He's doing a background on Azmando Vidal. 
 A fine. man. And thank God we're back on speaking terms -- or are we? 
 If you don' t know, who? A buzzer sounds from inside. Elizabeth hands Tony her glass. 
 Would you be an angel and Tony takes the glass from her, crosses and puts it on a nearby bench. As he does so, Elizabeth is Look- ing after him, as to the others: 
 I've always had a =ad thing for sailors- They've got such neat little asses. As Tony returns and escorts her back into the theater:

 Now. Now. Yes. Now 
 What's wrong? 
 Shh. 
 L E IZAB£TE What's the ?.».. She breaks off because Tony has put his hand over her mouth. Her eyes blaze as she reaches for his wrist. 
 - Noise in the living- room. 
 There's a window in the front room. It rattles. 
 I don't know. 
 Well, I do. 
 as Elizabeth swings out of bed, naked, crossing out of the bedroom and into the hall. 
 As a. Second Man appears. This one has a gun. The First Man turns to him, speaking in a whisper. 
 Bring him down here. The- Second. Max. nods. We follow him as very softly he goes down the hallway. 
 
 As: the Second Man stands motionless, Tony is on. his feet and up to him. Tony takes the qua from him and tossing it an the bed gestures, forefinger to lips, be quiet. Now, Tony turns to the Man and. starts down the hall with him. Tony has him by the back of the jacket, his Tun pressed against the back of the Second Man's head. 
 TONY'S VOICE Turn very easy. The First Man turns, sees Tony and the Other Man. 
 S've got a. gun at your partner's head. There is 'a beat, then: 
 Drop the gun or I slit her throat. 
 You drop the knife. 
 Don't you think I'll kill her? 
. As the Second Man -- overconfident at finding hi=self still alive -- speaks to his partner. 
 Cut her a little bit to convince this asshcle. Open up her throat. Suddenly the Second Man's knees buckle as. Tony, in a lightning move, brings the gun barrel down across the Man's head. As the Second Man is on his hands and knees, Zi.?ce a stunned ox, dripping blood on the carpet, Tony tuns once more to the an with the knife. 
 I'm going to give you one more chance. Trot the k:i-`f:a and !'I--l let you go . 
 
 (LAUGHS) 7. 111 cut her fucking head off, first. 
 as the Second Man, still on his hands and knees, now pushes himself up to a kneeling position. 
 Show him a little blood. As the Man with the- knife nods grimly, Tony puts his gun to the back of the kneeling man's head and calmly pulls the trigger. 
 The. kneeling man plunges for+qard, dead, the back of - his head blown off.. Tony now turns, without emotion, to the man with the knife. 
 That's what you're going to look like in two seconds if you harm that girl.. 
 As the First Man drops his knife and releases Elizabeth, she is locking at Tony, stunned, her aplomb totally vanished. 
 Go get dressed and call the Police. Elizabeth nods and half-stumbles out of the room. Tony crosses to the Man. 
 (CONTIJ UED ) 
 (CODITINT1EI1) 
 when the cops come, you're going to be up on a murder rap, baby. 
 No, I'm not. Tony lifts the gun and blasts the First Man three times in the chest. 
 as Elizabeth bursts bac k into the room, looks, then starts to scream. Tony crosses up and taking her in his arms, softly comforts her. 
 It's all right.. He tried to get my gum away and I had to shoot him. As. Tony, still comforting her, moves her away, We --

 This way. M=. As AIRSTRIP - DAY A rough airstrip has been bulldozed out of the scrib pine and palmetto forest. At one end is a hanger and on its side the words: INTER-CAR EAN CBAMTERS. As Croce and the Latin Americans come up:

 I'm pleased to meet you, Doctor. They shake hands, then:. 
 Permit me to present my companions -- Indio, Borracho, Padre Pepe, El Fararon, Arrigo and my brother, Jorge. The members of the assault team -- the Indian, the Drunk, the Priest, the Pharoah, Arrigo who looks like a pimp, and the romantic, fire-eating younger brother -- are introduced to Tony individually. Xd lib greetings, then to Barcenas: 
 Are you read-!?

 (NODS) Everything is arranged. 
 we got you BARS and Carbines plus ten, thirty calibre light machine guns, and ten, four-point t o inch mortars with a thousand rounds of high explosive and a thousand, rounds of white phosphorous. Tony is pointing out the various boxes and crates:

 CONT=TISW As Jorge crosses. over to the box of weapons, picks one up in his.hands: 
 Ten thousand rounds! Aye de mi! 
 as. Tony picks up and hands Roberto a long, olive green plastic tube. 
 We also got you two hundred Sixty- six, millimeter, M-72 LAW rockets. They're lightweight, one-shot dis- posable Bazookas. 
 We make a little trouble for E: Presidents, hey? 
 When do we leave? 
 You, go in tomorrow to get it ready. I'll meet you down there at the end of the week.

 I'll show you the set up. As Tony and Padre Pepe move off together toward. a short wave radio set up in the corner, ae -- 
 Here they came. We are pulling back. Also present in the large, attrac- tive office, are Tom Hagen, Danny DeVito and Sant no Corleone, who is at the bar fixing drinks. 
 Half an hour late.

= What you've got to understand, Rocco, is that what happened to Al was business. What's done is done. The important thing is to avoid trouble if we can. This isn't the old days. The Five 'Family wars are over and done with. 
 Maybe that's too bad. 
 as Santino comes over with the drinks io± Hagen and DeVito. As Danny accepts his-drink and raises it to

 To you -- all of you. I'll never be able to thank you for what you done. As DeVito drinks, the intercom is buzzing. Hagen flicks it.

 Send them in, please. 
 Eagen comes around his desk to the door to greet Maatrocina as he enters, followed closely by the cold-looking Ralph Augusto. 
 Sam. Z'm glad. you could come. Ralph. Good to see you. What are you drinking? 
 Z'11 take a little bourbon with you._ On the rocks. Sagem nods at Santino who crosses to the bar to make the drink, as Hagen turns now to Augusto. 
 Ralph? 
 Nothing.

 As Maatrocina makes flat paddles of his hands and points them inward to his chest as he turns to DeVito.

 I'd like to put a couple of people with you,, Danny. 
 I don't need your people, Tom. 
 
 I'll take a rain check. 
 As Devito grins, shakes hands around and exits, Hagen turns to Santino. 
 I want you to fly to Washington tonight. Talk to Senator Geary. Anybody you have to. But find out who ' s on Maatrocina' s payroll. 
 Neither do 1. 
 CCNTI2MED : 
 You think he's walking into some- thinq down there? 
 That's what I want you to find out. As Santino turns and goes, we --- 
 as the crowd laughs and cheers them on. 
 A Aqua! We move up to a loud speaker attached to an ornate and bunting festooned.lampost. From the speaker we hear: 
 VIDAL'S VOL= But make no mistake, any of you -- you of the North American delega- tion in particular. We welcome you to our Count=y -- but the days of exploitation are over. 
 As the predominantly Latin American crowd cheers, we pick out Tony, in civilian clothes, amongst. the' cheer- ing people.

Also in the delegation, in uniform, is Stu Palmateer. The older man's eyes meet with Tony's for a brief moment. He has seen the exchange.

 -- Tony has turned off the television set with a remote control switch, having heard the. sound of a key in the front door. He rises and turns as Elizabeth enters carrying a paper bag. 
 Listen, I -- He breaks off as Elizabeth's face goes pale with shock and she drops the bag on the floor. A couple of oranges roll across the rug as: 
 I'm sorry, I had to talk to you She looks at him her expression almost readable as anger; 
 You're listed as missing. It's on the wire. 
. Well, much as I.hate to disappoint everybody. 
 (CONTINCRM ) 
=M= : Suddenly Elizabeth drops to her knees and starts crawling around on the floor, blindly searching for the oranges. 
 - as he locks at her for a puzzled moment, then drops to his own knees and taking her by the shoulders, straightens her. Tears are pouring down her cheeks. 
 Bey, wait a minute He kisses her. 
 What's all. this crying shit? She smiles, sniffles, blinks the tears out of her eyes,

 We'll go in the back way. 
 I Yes Sir. The Chauffeur turns down a side street and up an alley. 
 Give him the horn. The Chauffeur honks the horn. The Laborer grins over at the limousine, gestures, palms up. 
 So we walk. It's not far. 
 as Augusta, Danny Devito and the Chauffeur move up toward the rear of the truck, the Laborer jumps down off the big barrel he's been sitting on. 
 Hello Danny. At this point the Chauffeur wheels and grabs Devito in an arm lock, with one gloved hand clamped over his mouth. 
 as a knife suddenly glitters in his hand and he plunges it into Devito. Danny is kic-ting and st-aggling. 
 Hold the cocksucker still.. As Augusta plunges the knife into Danny again and again and again. AN WAVZ"11 r?Nf:I.E The Laborer has taken the lid of, the barrel. Danny sinks to the pavement, convulses and dies.

 Wha_ is it? 
 Your friend, DeVito --- The TV` set has warmed up and now the Newscaster's voice comes over the pict'..ire of a middle-class house in Bayonne, New Jersey. 
 There have been no ransom demands and the Devito family -- although concerned -- are not yet alarmed. 
 As the Television Newscaster switches to another item, we see a burning house, fire engines, so on. 
 Long Beach, New York. In a possibly related incident, the home of re- puted Syndicate figure Santsno Corleone was firebombed early this morning.

 The Hagen car comes to a s tor on its wheels again. The Corleone Butt-an Men it the fol icwinc ca= -snt? cut, run up. 
 As Rocco Lampone comes out of the wreckage, the Button men are pulling Tony -- who is unconscious -- out. Lampone looks at Fritz and Hagen. 
 Not a goddamned thug you can do for them. Let's get out of here.

It is the coal of a cigarette as someone takes a last puff, tamps it out, then scratches a match and. lights another. In the flare of the match we see a Nurse's bulldog face. 
 Who are you? 
 OY., gc?od, you're awake.

ANOThR ANGLE (MIRROR SHOT) We are angled into a mirror over a chest of drawers, holding on Tony as he sits up in bed, then gingerly gets to his feet. He is wearing silk pajamas. Now he crosses to the mirror and checks himself out. Aside from the bandage he seems to be in one -piece. Now, in the mirror we see the door open and silhou- etted in the doorway, the figure of Michael. Tony turns. ANOTffER ANGL - as Tony and Michael look at one another for. a long moment. 
 How are you feeling? 
 S What am I doing here? As Michael comes into the room and closes the door: 
 I had Rocco bring you. 
 A little. 
 The Doctor says it's nothing.to bother you, but I've always found it's easier to be brave about some- body else's headache. 
 Did he say how soon T could leave? 
'Z?? Sit dcwn. Sim down.. 
 r'd like to get out of here as soon as possible. 
 Let me ask you a question. Have you any idea where you stand? 
 I'm not totally stupid. 
 I aC 't think you're stupid. I think you're smart. 3 t not smart enough. 
 t'n willing to learn. 
 Good. 
 Are 'you sure? Michael answers that question with a look: Of course in sure. 
, The question to ask is this: Who knew you were flying to Las Vegas?- 
 The girl I was staying with and --- Tony breaks off: 
=L Someone f_ cm Langley? 
 Before I left, I called a man named Stuart ?almateer. (CONY r ED) 
 
 I told Tom Hagen -- God rest his soul --- but I warned him. it was a. mistake -- that whole Vidal business. As the only contact between our people and the Government you had no protec- tion. You were naked. 
 As Tony sits. He's not sure whether he likes or trusts or is ready to forgive his father, but he knows the sound of good sense when he hears it. 
 How long do you think the-Administra- tion would last if it were to come out that the President used the Corleone family to assassinate the head of a foreign state. 
 Michael takes out a cigar and goes about the ceremony of lighting it. 
 - I'm not supposed to smoke these things, but it, isn't every day a man's son comes home. 
 You were saying? 
 Every year- -- on February third -- I've sent you a check. Those ohecks were never cashed 
 Would you like to '.cacw why? 
 r've always know why -- and z res- pect your reasons. But, neverthe- less, I'm your lather and anything t have is yours - if it's money you want, my friendship, the benefit of my experience -- if you'll accept it. It's yours. 
 I I need your advice. 
 (nods, then) There are two ways I see to handle this. First, I can make you dis- appear in. Sicily until everything blows over. Things change. Men get old and angers cool. In four or five years you could probably be safe to come home again.. 
 What's the other way? 
? 0 The other way is a gamble that you could lose. 
 Think about it. Sleep on it. We'll talk again in the morning. 
 Your father will be out in a moment.

 Yes.. As Tony puts down the picture, Michael comes up. 
 Z remember that I loved him.

 I've been thinking about these choices. Michael holds up his hand to delay the decision.

 About the same. 
 I always liked that town. That' S where Z met your mother -- when I was going to school up there.

 Not as much as I' d. expected. 
 MO 2 CUSZ I remember him very well -- from the Senate hearings on crime. Heat little man. Very polite, spoke in a soft, reasonable voice. He sat there with two million dollars worth of legal talent at his elbow and told the United States Government to go piss up a rope. 
 (SMILES) You had to admire the pretentious little bastard. 
 We're wasting each other's time with this, Mister Morehouse. 
 ' M All right, Son. This is your party. You've got five minutes. 
 The big mistake was that I'm still alive.

 I don't know what the hell you're talking about. (C 0 di': I?It ) 
 
 If anything should happen to me -- anything at all -- you can find out. The full story will be all over the six o'clock news. 
 I'd like to hear your conception of the full story.. 
 You were running a no-lose operation. if we succeeded, you were rid of Vidal. -- if we failed, the Corleone family was set up to take the blame. Your hands were clean. I was the only one who could dispute your story and I wasn't supposed to come back. I've found out that my res- ignation from the Navy was processed and accepted a full week before I went down here --- 
 Stu? 
= Well, yes, Sir. His resignation did 
 A clerical error. 
 And I don't buy it. 
 don't give a shit if you buy it or not. And I'll tell you some- thing else, Mister Adams, or what- ever your fucking name is, I don't react favorably to blackmail. 
 It's not blackmail. It's a simple statement of fact. If anything happens to me or if the Corleone Family is damaged iz these Senate Hearings, then the whistle blows and the whole zdmin .st_ation aces. 
 And what makes you think T. give a shit about what happens to the Admin- istration? Morehouse grins without humor. Tony's eyes flicker. Morehouse has told something that Tony needed to know. Morehouse is up and coming around the desk, as he continues. _

 No. You've taken over the job.

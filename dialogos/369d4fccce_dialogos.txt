 CLOCK-CALENDAR. 
 And "we" is...? 
 
 Warm-up? 
 Just the check. 
 (V.O.) It's a joke, but it's true. The future changes every time you look at it. Because you looked at it. 
 (V.O.) Cause once you see it, you're different. 
 (V.O.) Maybe just a little. 
 (V.O.) And that changes everything else. 
 (V.O.) It's got something to do with quantum physics. 
 Try that one, man. I've got a feeling. 
 Against my religion. 
 Do it, quick, before somebody else gets there. 
 MEGA-JACKPOT. 
 (V.O.) Mainly I stick to blackjack. Boring but controllable. 
 (V.O.) And safe unless they think you're counting. 
 Call me, like they did. And try to hold him till I get here. 
 What's your pleasure? 
 Grand Dad, rocks. 
 What's your pleasure? 
 Scuse me, sorry. 
 I don't see an earphone on him. 
 (stands) Give me a headset. I'm going down there. 
 You! I just need to talk to you! 
 Homeland Security! 
 We found a dirty bomb in East Vegas. A barrel of C-4 and a kilo of nuclear waste. But we're getting chatter about a dozen more out there somewhere, ready to blow. 
 (snide) Another remote viewer? 
 I need six men to bring him in. 
 We're on Code Orange. 
 That's an ultra low probability. None of your "specials" have ever panned out, and this isn't the time to experiment. 
 Come on, Eric, you saw it. We're flying blind and he's got radar. 
 Callie, people are talking. They say I'm only funding your research because we're involved. 
 Right. 
 I'm sorry, but they're right. 
 You bastard. 
 I care about you, and I wanted to support you. But there's a limit to what I can... 
 (professional) Look, we analyzed what this ability would look like if it existed. (MORE) 
 No. (beat) I've got a country to protect. 
 Use your charm on somebody else. 
 (V.O.) Most of the time, I'm not paying attention. Just making sure I don't step in a mess. 
 (V.O.) Sometimes I get a blast from far away. 
 (V.O.) Or I can start with a glimpse of something close and keep pushing on. 
 (V.O.) Usually it's none of my business. 
. 
 Guy around? 
 You are? 
 Tell him it's King Midas. 
 - 
 Terry? Terry! - I know you've got your hands full but I was wondering if you might be able to spare a few warm bodies for an outside operation. 
 We're strictly internal. 
 That's why I need your people. Everybody else is assigned. 
 Does Wisdom know about this? 
 He suggested it. 
 Callie. (corrects herself) Agent Ferris. I've got a face match on your subject. His name is Cris Johnson. 
 I need to cash some chips. - Got tagged. 
 You burned through your stash already? 
 I've been trying to lay low. 
 You showed me yours. I'll show you mine. 
 (slurred) He was gonna kill you! You all would'a died! 
 That was the night Donna broke off our engagement. 
 Ahh. 
 I was so drunk I could barely see now. 
 Well, I hope you don't mind. I called Neal to let him know you're here. 
 Christ, Guy, did you have to? 
 You say everything's inevitable, so I guess I did. 
 Well, you can save your breath. Cause I know what you're gonna say. 
 Then you're aware that Neal is in a serious cash crunch and could lose it all. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm done playing the market. 
 Neal's got it all worked out. He'll fly you out of the country on his jet. Put you up in style. He pays taxes, totally legal. You get cash, squeaky clean. Half the net. When your share hits fifty mil, you can say "finito"...and it's over. 
 Except last time, Neal didn't take "finito" for an answer. 
 You need us, asshole! The Law is breathin' down your neck! 
 I can stay ahead of `em forever. 
 But why live that way? 
 Because I don't want to be used any more. 
 What do you give a shit as long as you get what you want? 
 Cause what I want is freedom. And you don't get it by giving it up. 
 Enjoy it while it lasts. 
: 
 Looking for this? 
 Don't mess with somebody who knows your moves before you even think 'em. 
 The jet'll be sold in a week. Then there goes your ticket out. 
 Don't wait for me. 
 He's just some gambler. Lives completely off the grid. No bank account. No credit cards. No previous record. 
 Must be a wacko. He'd never met the victim. No connection whatsoever. 
 You saw. He's got eyes in the back of his head. He can see around corners. I even had him in custody once, and he disappeared. 
 And what is it you want him for? 
 About? 
 Well, I guess Homeland Security trumps liquor store murder. How can I help? 
 What are you doing back here? 
 I came to fix you dinner. 
 Idiot. 
 This is what you get from two packs a day. 
 It was already too late. I just didn't know it. 
 Sometimes not knowing is better. 
 Look where you're headed, pal. The big decisions are over before you even realize you made `em. 
 I've got a little problem with the IRS. Think I could get some relief? 
 Depends how helpful you are. 
 I need to speak to him alone. 
 And another thing, no woman ever turns him down, I'm serious. Mainly because he only propositions the ones he knows'll say yes, which is most of `em anyway. But does that make him happy? No. Says he's bored. Never surprised. Has to watch himself die over and over again. 
 Why'd he come back to Vegas? 
 Didn't say, but I'm guessin' it's this friend who's dying. An old fart who took him in when he was strung out on drugs. - He's an orphan, ya know. Been on the road since he was ten. 
 You want my advice? Get yourself a good lawyer and turn yourself in. 
 If I tell `em the truth, you know what happens? I end up with the Feds. - And you know what they do to me? 
 Make you a secret agent. 
 Dan Rather or Peter Jennings? 
 It's not funny, Irv. That's all I do, day after day, for the rest of my life. Watch the news until I lose my hair and croak. 
 The best I can do is stay away from all of `em. 
 In that case, you've gotta leave the country. 
 I know, I know, but there's something I gotta do first. 
 What? 
 Cris? 
 She's coming here. The Fed. 
 You gotta go? 
 Let's play it out. 
 I've got the place all picked out. It's called Palau. Three hundred teeny islands in the South Pacific. (places roast in pan) Nothing ever happens there, so there's nothing to foresee. 
 Then what the hell are you waiting for? 
 Her. 
 Who? 
 I haven't met her yet. 
 Then find somebody else! 
 It has to be her. 
 What's so special about this one? 
 She's the mother of my child. 
 I thought you were shooting blanks. 
 I guess the doctors were wrong. 
 I don't mean to be indelicate, my friend, but how do you know the little bastard is yours? 
 He's got my thing. 
 Your thing? 
 My thing. 
 I still don't understand why you never got that fixed. 
 Agent Ferris, come in. 
 One step ahead of the game. 
 Let's go in the kitchen. I've got a roast in the oven. 
 You're wasting your life, Cris. You have the most amazing talent, and you're running from it. 
 Yeah, people say I could have been a chef. 
 Now if you say that man in the liquor store was going to shoot five people, I believe you. Why else would you kill a stranger? 
 But no good deed goes unpunished, eh? (MORE) 
 Everyone but you, of course. 
 I can fix your legal problems. More importantly, I can give you a chance to use your gift. 
 Trust me, it's better if I don't. It's better if I just mind my own business. 
 I'll be honest with you, Cris. That's not an option. Your country needs you. And if we don't grab you, somebody else will. 
 Nobody's grabbed me yet. 
 I'd like you to come with me for some testing. Would you be willing to do that? 
 Where are you going? 
 (temporarily blinded) Shit! Cavanaugh! 
: 
 In that case, you've gotta leave the country. 
 I know, I know, I've got the place picked out. But there's something I've gotta do first. 
 What? 
 Cris? 
 I have to go. 
 You just got here. 
 I know, but they're coming for me. 
 This is for nurses and stuff, to make things a little easier. 
 You're gonna need it. 
 I don't suppose you've discovered any last minute escape for me? 
 I looked, Irv, I really did. I went down every path, every treatment. Sometimes there's just no... 
 It's okay. It's okay...Now I can relax. 
 I need him alive, Cavanaugh. Even if he resists. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Tell them. 
 That's very helpful information. 
 Mind if I join you? 
 (prickly) Yeah, actually I do. 
: 
 Is that cruller any good? 
: 
 Shopping for a car? 
 What business is it of yours? 
: 
 Rough day? 
: 
 Aw Christ! Look what you've done! 
 I'm so sorry. I'm a spaz. 
 Yeah, you are. 
 It looked like you spilled it on purpose. 
 Why would I do that? 
 I don't know. To impress me? 
 Look, I'm sorry. If I could, I'd do it over. 
 Here. 
 Well, Liz, your luck's about to change. 
 How's that? 
 You met me. 
 And what are you, a leprechaun? 
 An angel, actually. And we always reward the people who help us. 
 Great, what do I have to do? 
 You don't have to do anything. 
 But I could use a ride. 
 When does the luck kick in? 
 It already has. 
 I don't feel anything. 
 Not even a tingle? 
 Son, I haven't had a tingle in eight months. 
 Then you're way overdue. For a reversal of fortune. 
 Any kids? 
 Thirty. (off his look) I teach fifth grade. 
 I mean of your own. 
 I guess that's good. Considering. 
 No, that was the problem. - I couldn't get pregnant. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. 
 You didn't. I'm just running off at the mouth. - That's why I was in Vegas. To see another doctor. 
 He didn't want to adopt? 
 No, he had to have a Randy Junior. 
 What, is there an accident? 
 When does the luck kick in? 
 It already has. 
 I don't feel anything. 
 (urgent) Take this exit. Quick! 
 Why? 
 Just take it! 
 It's too late! 
 No it's not! 
 Let go! Are you out of your mind?! 
 Get out! 
 Traffic was piling up. You didn't see it? 
 GET OUT!! 
 We could'a been stuck there for hours. 
 I don't give a flyin' goddamn! You don't grab the steering wheel! 
 You're right. I'm sorry. I panicked. I get phobic sitting in traffic. It won't happen again, I promise. 
 Damn straight, cause you won't be in the car! 
 How `bout at the next gas station? Please. I'll fill up your tank. 
 Long enough to know we're not gonna catch him by surprise. 
 What, you think he's got some kind of radar? 
 Interesting idea. It'd explain a whole lot. 
 And Area 51 would explain my missing tennis shoes. But that doesn't mean they're on a flying saucer. 
 In this case, it does. 
 I am really really really really sorry. 
 I'd call your proof a little iffy. 
 Look, from your own experience, this guy can't be punched, shot, surprised, captured, or confined. So either he's got something special, or you're an idiot. 
 Let's say I'm not an idiot... 
 And I'm not saying you are. 
 Then what? 
 We've got to think like he does. We've got to think ahead. 
 But lately I've been traveling all around Oregon. It's really peaceful up there. 
 All right, I'm starting getting the picture. - Basically, you're a no- good, worthless ramblin' man who's never held a job in life. 
 (smiles) Exactly. 
 This is where I turn into town. 
 Well, thanks for the ride. 
 Thanks for the card. 
 You're welcome. 
 No, no, I've gotta teach tomorrow. 
 I understand...Well, see ya. 
 So long. 
 Well, maybe just a quick one. 
 Hey, George. 
 I'll take the usual and he'll have a... 
 Sierra Pale. 
 He's not here now, is he? 
 Thanks. 
 We gotta split. My ex is here. 
 Sure, Randy. I'll call you tomorrow. 
 Just a friend. 
 I'm not yours anymore, asshole! 
 You still care for me, I know it. 
 Easy, man. 
 Get out of here! Get out! 
: 
 
 You still care for me, I know it. 
 Easy, man. 
 Stop it, Randy! Stop it! 
 Get out of here! Get out! 
 Oh God, I'll take you to the emergency room. 
 No ho'pital. I don' nee' ho'pital. 
 God, I hate that bastard...Will somebody get some ice! 
 I'm sorry I'm causing you all this trouble. 
 Are you kidding? You stood up for me. 
 Actually, I wasn't standing for that long. 
 Sorry it's so cold in here. The heater's broken. 
 I really should've left him a long time ago. God knows he deserved it. 
 Why didn't you? 
 Cause I don't leave. I never have. My boyfriends always left me. 
 I get attached to people, and then I'll put up with anything. 
 What a terrible quality. You're too loyal. 
 Sit in the light. 
 I never minded that I was the more devoted one. Somebody's gotta be more this or more that. 
 But they never appreciate it, that you're there for them. 
 They just try and get away with more and more, and figure you'll just... 
 Salty. 
 Christ, I don't even know you. I have no idea who you are. 
: 
 Sorry to get you caught up in my soap opera. 
 Once you start watching, it's hard not to get involved. 
 You ever been married? 
 Almost. 
 What happened? 
 She wanted kids. 
 And you didn't? 
 It's just that...I can't. 
 Why are you telling me this? These personal details. 
 I don't know. You asked and...I guess I felt like you'd understand. 
 That was incredible. 
 This. 
 That was...I've never... 
 So basically we've got nothing. 
 You're failing your country, people. You're not trying hard enough. (looks around the table) Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you understand what I expect from you? 
 (suddenly calm) Are there any questions? 
 You know you're very sexy when you're ruthless. 
 We're groping in the dark. 
 My guy's got a flashlight. We just need to bring him in. 
 I'll see if Baines can spare some manpower. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 You said it was broken. 
 Well, you're not leaving till it's fixed, I'll tell you that. 
 As long as it's done right. 
 This one first. 
 What is it? 
 A trap for somebody who can see the future. 
 If you say so. 
 And then these. 
 And what was the main staple of their diet? 
 From the lake? 
 No. From the rivers. 
 Right. And the Washo were so jealous of their fishing grounds that when other Native Americans came to trade for dried fish, they were only permitted to remain one night. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Ice cream sandwiches? Do you have any idea how much fat they have in them? Don't you see how overweight half of them are? 
 (crestfallen) I - I didn't think of it. - I thought you'd be happy to see me. 
 Well next time exercise a little forethought, okay? 
 Do you want me to leave these somewhere? 
 No. 
 All right then. I'll just go. 
 Put a few in the freezer. I love ice cream sandwiches. 
 You have been such a bad influence. I'm gonna be up all night grading papers. 
 I've got a better idea. Run away with me to the South Pacific. 
 Funny. We've only known each other a week. 
 But we're going to be happy together for the rest of our lives. Really, I peeked. 
 I think you're serious. 
 Deadly. 
 Let's go pack your bags. We'll leave tonight. 
 And what'll we do for money? 
 Don't worry. That's always been easy for me. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Why? 
 Well, first of all, it's the middle of the school year. 
 They'll replace you. 
 And I'm in charge of science fair. 
 They can pick up the slack. 
 It disturbs me, Cris, that you think it's okay just to duck your responsibilities. 
 I - I don't think it's okay. I'm not that kind of person. But I have this feeling, this very strong feeling, that it has to be now. We have to leave soon, or it's not gonna work out. 
 I don't believe that. If it's meant to be between two people, somehow it'll happen. 
 Yes, but sometimes you have to make it happen. You have to seize the opportunity before it's too late. 
 What are you afraid of, Cris? Why are you running away from yourself? (MORE) 
 Your students are very lucky. 
 Now I've got to grade papers. 
 But then you have to sign the divorce papers. 
 
: 
 Cris. 
 I said I'll pay. 
 You're damn right you'll pay! I wanna talk to the cops. 
 No need for that. I'll give you cash. Okay? Will you take cash? 
 Make it three. 
 Okay, three. 
 So you throw rocks at them? 
 What do you want me to do? Wait for people to die? 
 Cris...I think you should move on. Today. 
 Look, there's something I've been wanting to tell you. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 It does. 
 I know. 
 What are you saying, you're some sort of prophet? 
 It's not religious. I just happen to see my life before it happens. 
 Cris, it's sweet that you feel responsible for people. But I think you need help. 
 Flip it. 
 Why? 
 Just do it. 
 Heads. 
 Flip it again. (calls it in the air) Tails. 
 Tails. (she looks;flips again) Heads. (she looks, flips again) Tails. 
 Now you believe me? 
 Yeah. And I don't want to have anything to do with you. 
 Liz. (follows) Don't you see? I can get us all the money we need. 
 Don't follow me. Don't talk to me. Get out of my life! 
: 
 Cris...I think you should move on. Today. 
 Why? Because I care so much about kids that sometimes I overreact? 
 Hard to say. She's impossible to control. 
 She's quite a challenge. 
 I swear, I can't figure you out. 
 Believe me, the feeling is mutual. 
 Sometimes you seem mindlessly impulsive. But other times I feel like you're utterly calculating, saying exactly what you think'll push my buttons. 
 What do you mean? 
 Don't you think it's kind of an amazing coincidence that neither of us can have kids? 
 You want to talk to my doctor? I'll get him on the phone. No, really, I mean it. I'll have him send you my records. Because I want you to trust me. 
 Then open up. Talk to me. Where are you going with your life? 
 All the time. - But mainly how to stay out of trouble. 
 No goals? Dreams? Ambitions? 
 There's only one thing I've ever wanted. 
 What's that? 
 A family. 
 That's all? Just a family? 
 Well, I was, as they say, left on a doorstep when I was two. (makes light of it) Never found foster parents who could put up with me. - So to me, a family sounds like plenty. 
 You've got to be making this up. 
 I wish. 
 You poor guy. 
 I say we get the whole department up here and bust his ass. 
 Then why won't he see through your trap? 
 I'll meet you inside. I need to pick something up at the drug store. 
 Stay in the car. If he sees your shadow, he won't take the bait. 
 You haven't been chasing him for three years. 
 Yes? 
 Agent Ferris. 
 He's not a killer. He needs help. 
 (aghast) You're not gonna let them. 
 That's why I came to you. 
 Okay, I'll talk to him. I'll try to get him to... 
 Even his best friend says he'll never turn himself in. - At this stage, there's only one way to keep him from self-destructing. 
 I ran into a friend I hadn't seen in a while. 
 She said we could use her cabin up at the peak. 
 God, this is gorgeous. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 But silently, right? 
 Unnoticeably. 
 And that's when we go in. 
 Gentlemen, try to think like him. - If the plan is to go in right after he's trapped, he'll see it coming and he'll slip away before he's trapped... (to Cavanaugh) Like he's always done. 
 And if he doesn't know he's trapped, he can't foresee knowing he's trapped. 
 That kinda makes sense. 
 The eureka moment is when he realizes he's been trapped. 
 When is that? 
 Voila. 
 You're smart. 
 Cris. Do you think we met for a reason? 
 You mean, do I believe a higher power brought us together? 
 Yeah. 
 No. I think we're just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the Big Bang. 
 That's not very romantic. 
 Oh, but it is. Think of it: For us to meet, everything from the very beginning, every sub-atomic event, every galactic cataclysm, every step of evolution, every act, every accident, every decision in the history of the universe had to happen exactly the way it did just so you and I could be together, right here and now. 
 To whatever happens next. 
 I shouldn't. 
 (concerned) Why? 
 I'm late. 
 Late? 
 That's why I went to the drug store. To get a pregnancy test. 
 You know what this means? 
 I do now. 
 How did it...? 
 I have no idea. Unless...But that still doesn't explain... 
 Liz, I really did have this problem. I wasn't lying to you. 
 But this is good. This is amazing. I want this baby more than anything. 
 It's like a miracle. 
 For both of us. 
 Women hate good-looking men. Rejecting them makes us feel powerful. 
 No. But she doesn't really love him. 
 Surprise. 
 You lying bitch! You betrayed me! 
 (whispers) Liz, please, I love you. 
 Let me talk to you for one minute. I won't hurt you, I promise. 
 Cris, I know you don't mean to hurt people. But you need help or you're going to keep on hurting them. 
 The man I killed was there to rob the store. He was going to panic and shoot five innocent people. 
 How do you know this? 
 Because I saw them die. 
 Like yesterday, with the car? 
 Yes. 
 You were afraid something bad might happen so you... 
 Not "might"! Those people died! - They just hadn't died yet. 
 What if you hadn't done anything? Have you ever waited to see what would happen? 
 Once. 
 That's why I don't go out much. So I won't be there to see. 
 What's taking so long? 
 We could just do this the old- fashioned way. 
 Cris, you're a good man. And I will stand by you through this. But you have to... 
 If they catch me, they'll put me in a cell without a trial, and they'll never let me out. They do that, you know. 
 I won't let it happen. I'll get you a lawyer. 
 Cris...Cris. 
 There's one decent path. (fixes her gaze) But if we're gonna stay on it, I need you to do exactly what I say. 
 Will you give me one chance? One chance in exchange for a miracle? 
 
 Okay. Wait for my signal. 
 A few steps on, your robe will get caught on a thornbush. You won't be able to get unstuck. Ferris and a tough guy will come help you. She'll say, "You've done your country a great service." 
 And then? 
 Be unpredictable. Surprise works to my advantage. - And read this when you're safe. 
 Will I see you again? 
 Bet on it. 
 (disappointed, via radio) We stand pat till notified. Don't make a sound. 
 What's she waiting for? 
 
 Then why do I feel like a traitor? 
 
 (relays a message) We've got movement in the canyon. (to radio) Where are you? 
 We tried it your way. 
 Boys, now it's our turn. 
 I want him alive. Tell them. 
 
 
 You've made a very stupid mistake. 
 I trust him more than I trust you. 
 You've never even met him. 
 But I've profiled him for months. And I can tell you this: he doesn't love anybody. How could he? To him, we're not even human. (MORE) 
 1 I'm trying! 
 (shakes her head) I underestimated him. 
 By a lot. 
 (to radio and Baines) Change of plans, everybody. (MORE) 
 No, it's an order. 
 There's only one way to beat this man. He's got to see his own death, and not just maybe. He's got to see himself die again and again and know it's inescapable. And then, maybe, he'll surrender. 
 That'll be his choice. And he was no use to us anyway. 
: 
 Damn. Fifty men might not be enough. 
 Somehow we've got to bring him down to our level. 
 I'm workin' on it. 
 He's crossed over into Maxwell Gorge. 
 Move in fast. Keep him moving. Don't let him rest. 
 Don't give him time to look ahead. That's the key. 
: 
 He's heading this way. 
 
 
 
 
 This is your last warning. 
 
 
 
... 
 Believe me now? 
 I'm getting used to miracles. 
 Where were you going? 
 No idea. I was just trying to be unpredictable. 
 So what's the plan? Bonnie and Clyde? 
 It's starting to sound really good. 
 I'll check on our ride. 
 Will we make it? 
 Right now I'm just trying to stay alive. 
 
 Christ, you live dangerously. 
 Just the opposite. I never take chances. 
 
 (to radio) Cavanaugh, get all your men into town. (waits) Cavanaugh? Tell them. 
 You take command of the chase. (hands him the map) Have cars block these intersection. 
 Why these? 
 Get in the chopper. 
 
 Did the doctors ever say why you couldn't have kids? 
 I grew up at Love Canal. 
 What's that? 
 A neighborhood back East built over a chemical dump. A bunch of my friends had birth defects. (looks back) I always figured I was lucky just to be sterile. 
 Except you're not. And neither am I. We're different, that's all. We just had to find the right match. 
 And somehow we did. 
 (discouraged) He doesn't miss a beat. 
 (pleased, to herself) Come to momma. 
 (to radio) Stay after him. Keep the pressure on. 
. 
 (incredulous) He's driving right into it... 
 Sometimes looking one step ahead isn't enough. 
 You make it look easy. 
 Oh shit. Oh no. 
 I blew it. 
 I need your vehicle. 
 What's the plan? 
 Playing chicken. 
 Don't be stupid! He knows what you'll do! 
 But so do I. And for once, that makes us even. 
 GET OUT! NOW! OR YOU'LL DIE! 
 
 
 CRIS' VISIONS: 
 
 
 A 
 
 
 Cuffs on both wrists. Leave him if he doesn't. 
 I don't want to find out. 
 I was wrong about one thing. He is capable of love. 
 
 Why does everybody have amnesia but me? 
 I only ask one thing from you. Give me a chance to earn your trust. 
 Then give me another chance. You get `em all the time. 
 Don't let them know you're pregnant. 
 I promise. 
 Work with them Cris. So we can be together. 
 I'll get us out of here. We can still make the plane. 
 This game was different. He knew I wouldn't flinch. 
 It's red now. And we're out of leads. 
 Please, make me a believer. 
 
 Not possible with him. 
 Cris, please step into the next room. 
 
 
 Cris, we'll be firing at you with live ammo. Are you ready? 
. 
 Now we are going to use live ammo. 
 Not on my watch, you're not. 
 I promise you, he won't be hit. 
 It's your experiment. 
 "From now on, Cris, the bullets are real." 
 He's almost impossible to shoot, hit, surprise, capture, or contain. 
 Mind if I try? 
 Be my guest. 
 No minds to read. The guns are aimed automatically by infrared. 
 I'm going. No need for a hotfoot. 
 Why? 
 I know what happens. 
 You tie me down and never let me out. 
 Because you're trying to force me. 
 Whoa, you are one tough bitch. 
 We're still in a Code Red if I'm not mistaken. 
 He knew he'd get shocked, but he chose to resist. 
 He's almost never had to face consequences. (flips toggle) Cris, are you ready to get in the chair? 
 We need information, right? 
 Leave him there. We'll start again when he recovers. 
 Okay, how do we use him to find the bombs? 
 Simple. We make him watch the news and tell us about it. 
 How far ahead can he see? 
 I don't know. But I suspect we can increase his range with practice. Especially if we restrict his future to only watching news. Then he'll be like a timescope. 
 You were right. This is huge. 
 This is just for starters. You want to stage a pre-emptive strike, he can tell you if you'll hit the target and whether they hit back and what went wrong. And you can do this over and over until you get it perfect before you begin. 
 Right now, sweetheart, we can't even get him to sit in a chair. 
 We've got to think this through. Your friend could be more dangerous than the terrorists. 
 With this guy, you have to. Or it'll be over before it begins. 
 That may not be enough. We may have to cut off his arms and legs. Then I might start to feel safe. 
 Think about it. What we're talking about here is the next step in human evolution. And I'm not gonna make the same mistake the Neanderthals made when they ran across this good-looking Homo Sapien fellow and all the lady Neanderthals said, "He's so cute. Let's keep him around." 
 Can we deal with your sexual insecurities at another time? 
 You mean after it's too late? 
 I told you, he doesn't read minds. He sees the results. 
 
 
: 
 Wait for my signal, then go in and surround him. 
 I'll do the talking. 
 Cris, this Eric Wisdom. I'm the director of this facility. (MORE) 
 I don't believe you. 
 
 (to microphone) Cris, time is running out. 
: 
 
 Don't give him time. Send them in now. 
 Baines, do it. 
 Don't get too attached to your arms and legs. 
 Don't let him out of here alive. 
 If there's one soft heart, one slow shooter, he'll know it. 
 Be careful. I don't want anything to happen to you. 
 No demerol. I need to be alert. 
 Get him a local. 
 Not now. 
 This is getting interesting. We have a mating pair. 
 Secure the female. 
 (to Liz) We're here to protect you. 
 
 
 
 I found him! In here! 
: 
 
 
 
 I'm issuing infrared to all my men. We should have a fix in a few minutes. 
 You realize if he gets away now, we'll never get him back. He'll be out there, and he'll be our enemy. 
 We don't actually have to do anything. (beat) We just have to decide to do something...unthinkable. 
 You want me to threaten to kill a pregnant woman? 
 Threats don't count. When he foresees that you actually did kill her, that she's dead... (beat) He won't let it happen. - He'll come to us. Surrender. And she'll live. 
 But it only works if we're not bluffing. Because he'll know. 
: 
 
 
 
 
 
. 
 
 He's on this floor!...Shit! He's coming here! 
 
 
 WISDOM'S OFFICE 
 He's getting away. 
 
 WISDOM'S OFFICE 
 Any developments on the Code Red? ...Let me know if there are. 
 Baines, bring the girl friend to the Interrogation Room. (to Ferris) I'll deal with her there. 
 
 We're moving her. 
 
 
 Sit there and shut up. 
 
 You understand what's at stake here? We're playing for the future. Not just what happens next, but what the future is. What the rules are. (MORE) 
 By killing an innocent woman. 
 If you want, I'll pull the trigger. 
 I think that might be...more reliable. 
 I'll join you in a minute. I need to take care of some details. 
 Get more men up here. 
 
 FERRIS' OFFICE 
 This is Ferris. I'll need a chopper tanked up and ready. 
 (not listening) Where the hell did she get the scissors? 
 
 Hold your fire. (gets on the radio) We've got the target in plain sight in Corridor 2C, but he's holding a hostage. Agent Ferris. - Request instructions. 
 You won't believe this. He's got Ferris. 
 How? 
 I don't know, but he's on his way to the front door. (beat) They want instructions. 
 Don't shoot. 
 Then how are we going to stop him? 
 We don't. We let him go. - It's part of the plan. 
 You're sure about this? 
 No, but Ferris is. 
 I hope he loves you as much as I love her. 
 
 (to Ferris) He hasn't got the balls. 
 We'll find out, won't we? 
 You're not going to kill me. That's what the bad guys do. 
 In war, you have to be as ruthless as your enemy. 
 (emphatic) Cris isn't the enemy. 
 I didn't mean him. 
 
 
 Can't you just leave us alone? 
 
 
 God, you're remarkable. 
 I wish you had a little more sense of duty. 
 I'd say you have way too much. 
 Give me your keys. 
 (to soldier) If I see you, I'll kill her. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know what our problem is? 
 "We got off on the wrong foot." 
 It's really... 
 "all been a big misunderstanding." 
 Exactly. 
 "We've never meant you any harm." 
 It sounds so insincere when you say it. 
 I guess you're a better liar than I am. 
 You know what I'm going to say next? 
 It'll never happen. 
 My door will be open. We can start from scratch. 
 The magic word is cooperate. That's all we've ever wanted to hear from you. 
 When are they going to give up? After you're dead? 
: 
 To a gang of murderers? 
 I see you got our message. 
 What's about to happen...you've brought it on yourselves. 
 
 I'm planning on it. 
 
 
 Get out! 
 
 
 
 
 This is what they wanted you to prevent? 
 I guess... 
 And you wouldn't help? 
 They didn't explain. They were trying to force me. 
 Liz? Where are you going? 
 She's not coming with us? 
: 
 Where did you get this number? 
 That's music to my ears. 
 But I have conditions. 
 I'm sure we can work something out. 
 Liz... 
 I can't. - I have to go. 
 (incredulous) You're not leaving? 
 There's something I have to do. Something you'd want me to do. And I can't put it off any longer. 
 (wounded) Fine. Then go. What do I care? 
 Liz, it's not like that. I searched for you for a long time. I want to be with you forever. 
 Don't overdo it. We just met last night. 
 But a lot has happened since then. 
 While I was sleeping? 
 We're going to have a child. 
 Then you really are an angel. 
 I don't expect you to believe me. But when you do find out, remember that we came together for a reason. That this wasn't just...one night. It was a special chance for both of us. 
 Then why are you running away from me? 
 I'm not...I'm taking the long way around. 
 I don't understand. We got off to such a great start. 
 And I looked for a happy ending... But this was the best I could do. 
 See ya? 
 I wouldn't be surprised. 
 I wasn't ready till now. 
 We don't have time to waste. Maybe you could start by telling me how your talent works.

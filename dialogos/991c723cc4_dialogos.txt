 (O.S.) Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. 
 Oh yes, Telly it hurts, oh yes, oh yes, please Telly, Telly. 
 Yeah. 
 You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me. 
 Because, you know why. You know. 
 Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby. 
 Why is that? 
 I wouldn't believe it? 
 But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us. 
 (whispering) Do you care about me? 
 
 Shit. 
 Oh shit what happened? 
 You fucked it? 
 I knew you fucked it! I sat out her for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up! 
 Well, how was it? 
 She can fuck? 
 Oh shit. How long did it take? 
 How long did you fuck her? 
 Yeah. 
 How did she smell? Did her puss stink? 
 Oh man, it smells like butterscotch. 
 Oh man, that's the best. 
 Let me smell it again. 
 That's why virgins are the best. I love that smell. 
 What? 
 How? 
 Right. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Fuckin perverted bastard. 
 To what? Virgins? 
 What do you mean? 
 You mean like fucking two virgins at once. 
 (laughing) She's probably smash you in the fucking face. 
 Did you tell her that you loved her? 
 Shit. 
 Get another forty. (burps) Smoke a blunt. 
 Hell yeah. Fuckin starvin. Wait up a sec. 
 What for? That guys a dick. 
 You think he's got any herb? 
 You think? 
 He lives on 76th? 
 Den less go Joe. 
 Telly. 
 Did she suck your dick? 
 Why? 
 It is right. 
 It's no big deal, right? 
 Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is. (they both start laughing) It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first. 
 They're gonna tell their grand kids. (mimicking an old lady) That Telly. He sure was good in the sack! 
 Yeah, I feel dehydrated. 
 Three pennies and a ball of lint. 
 (whispers) Unzip my pack, yo. 
 He said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can't you understand English? 
 Stupy fucky boys! Fucky! 
 You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything. 
 Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know. (mimics the cartoon) Activate in the form of, a glass of water. 
 Well, those guys share everything, right? 
 And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right? 
 And it got me thinkin. How fun it would be to share each other's girl. 
 No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"! 
 (laughing) Can you do it man? 
 Oh man. I fucking love this guy. 
 (from box) Hello? 
 (from box) Hello? 
 What are you guys doing? 
 You want a wip-it? 
 Yeah. 
 I love these shits. 
 They're good for you. Vitamin C for the new generation. 
 That's why I like 'em. They wake my brain up. 
 I don't know, eight or nine. 
 Everywhere. Fuckin flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub. 
 Yo Telly. Jennie says what's up. 
 Jennie. You know. 
 That girl you boned last year. Remember? 
 Telly says was up. 
 I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick. 
 You still mad at him? 
 Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?! 
 What did he do? 
 He stole her virginity. He took it away and now it's gone forever. 
 Yeah. But it's not even the fact that he devirginized me. It's the fact that after it was done he never spoke to me again. He talked all this bullshit and then just broke out. 
 That's the kinda shit he's into. Telly is known for that stuff. He fucked Amber the same way. 
 And Susan too. 
 But he was all like, Oh Jennie I like you so much. Trust me you'll love it, I'm not gonna use you. I promise. He was poppin mad jazz. 
 First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car. 
 That shit is nothin. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit. 
 Oh yeah. 
 And we did it in the bush. Like outside around midnight. I got fucking mosquito bits all over my ass. And we thought everyone was sleeping, but they obviously weren't because everybody knew. And it was out on the grass somewhere. And it hurt like a motha, oh my god the pain! 
 (cracking up) That's the shit! That's the shit! 
 The pain. The fucking pain! 
 And you feel like you're being ripped open inside. 
 You are being ripped open. 
 I know. 
 Did you bleed? 
 I didn't bleed. 
 You didn't? 
 No, I didn't bleed. 
 I bled. I fucking bled all over the sheets. 
 Me too. 
 I bled. I bled like on the condom, there was blood everywhere. And you know what he started singing? He started singing "Sunday Bloody Sunday." That stupid fucking song. 
 I was like... I was like... No. They sang that the whole sleep away. My reputation! 
 It doesn't even matter though. It's such bullshit. The reputation is bullshit. 
 I know. 
 You know. 
 Yep. 
 I don't give a fuck. I have sex and I like fucking. 
 Hell yeah. I love. I love sex. 
 Foreplay. Foreplay. 
 (smacks hands together) Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom. 
 Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking! 
 Yep. 
 Making love is like. 
 Sweet. 
 Slow. 
 It's grandmother style. 
 Yeah. 
 It's like... 
 You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww. 
 Yeah. 
 Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring. 
 It's really slow. It's slow boring. 
 Yeah. 
 It's very monotonous. 
 Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex, 
 It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh. 
 Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like... 
 Passion... 
 Boom!!! Boom!!! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
 That's the one thing. They expect you to be so gentle, so kind... 
 When most of time you just wanna be all. Pounding on that shit. 
 That would be the best if you could just be. Excuse me can I borrow your hole Miss? It'll only take a little while. I'll give it right back. 
 Yep. 
 Yeah me too nigga. 
 You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you? 
 Yep. 
 You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown. 
 Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know. 
 Hell yeah, they don't know. 
 Like where are your erogenous zones? 
 Mine? 
 Mine are like my neck and my chest. 
 Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds! 
 Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there... 
 Oh shit. 
 And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco 
 Right. 
 And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard... 
 Yeah. 
 He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard. 
 RUBY (CONT'D) I was like ripping his hair out. And we kissed like so hard that our lips were busted. And that shit was so good. It was crazy. 
 (laughing) He was like ripping my hair. I was like oh yeah. (moving her hips back and forth) Work it. 
 You know why I decided to go out with Alex. 
 Why? 
 (starts laughing) He has the best fucking fingers I've ever had. 
 (still laughing) I was like yes! I'm going out with him! 
 That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex. 
 Yep. 
 Because he can like climax you up to that... 
 ... Point. 
 Yep. Where just one more move and you would be like crazy. 
 Yep. 
 But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?! 
 Yeah it's the biggest disappointment! 
 Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever 
 To come? 
 Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half. 
 Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes. 
 Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep. 
 Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored. 
 Yeah I get bored. 
 I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards. 
 Yeah, eat. I got real thirsty too. 
 You know what I notice? 
 What? 
 I notice that girls love to give head. It's like a secret pastime hobby for them. Or somethin'. 
 Some girls. 
 All girls. They love it. I know. 
 (under his breath) I hate this game. 
 Yeah. But when it's just you and them. That's like the first thing they go for. 
 I know. They love it. That's why girls live longer than guys. 'Cause sperm has vitamin C. 
 I hate sucking dick! 
 Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear. 
 And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging. 
 Yeah. And then it hits that little thing. (pointing to the back of her throat) That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever. 
 Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it. 
 And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know. 
 And you don't get shit out of it. 
 Have you ever swallowed it before? 
 No. 
 Me neither. 
 I have. 
 It was... it was. 
 It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter. 
 No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something. 
 Yeah. 
 You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting. 
 RUBY (CONT'D) The only way you can get it out is like if you eat like a real meal. 
 I mean. Telly is the only guy I've ever had sex with. You knew that. 
 No. I didn't know that. I thought you got with A.J. too. 
 No, we just messed around. 
 That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes. 
 Yeah. It's a great big fraud. 
 I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative. 
 Yeah. 
 And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe. 
 Yeah. 
 And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie. 
 I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone. 
 Did they ask you a lot of questions? 
 How old you? 
 17. 
 How old are you? 
 15. 
 How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with? 
 Umm. Altogether? 
 Yes. Altogether. 
 Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine. 
 How many times have you gone unprotected? 
 With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three. 
 How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with? 
 One. 
 Were you protected? 
 No. 
 Have you ever had anal intercourse? 
 Yes. 
 With how many people? 
 Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure. 
 Were they wearing condoms? 
 Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't. 
 Have you ever had anal intercourse? 
 No. 
 Okee dokey. You should come back in seven days and we should have your results. 
 (timidly) Thanks. 
 Man, this guy is really good. 
 I bet he makes hella money. 
 ... I don't know, I think he's mad at me, but who cares... 
 Woowee! It must have been something I ate! (coughs then smiles) Ruby, follow me. 
 Wish me luck. 
 Good luck. 
 Jennie. 
 (cough, pause) Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections. 
 Yes! 
 You're clean. 
 Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night. 
 Now you gotta be careful. 
 Here take these pamphlets home and read them. 
 Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection. 
 What? 
 The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should... 
 I tested positive? 
 I'm sorry. 
 But I only had sex with Telly. 
 I just got tested to keep Ruby company. 
 Who? 
 Oh. You like her? 
 Darcy? 
 Yeah. She's only 13. 
 Yeah. 
 (excited) Yeah. 
 (smiling) Yeah. 
 I know what you mean. 
 She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them. 
 (laughing) How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law. 
 Bet. 
 You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted? 
 (singing) I have no legs. I have no legs. I have no legs. I have no legs. 
 Thank you. God bless you. 
 Yeah. Bless you back. 
 Why I do what? 
 Why I give pennies? 
 Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs. (motions to his waist) He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage. 
 What are you talking about? 
 So. 
 So. You never know when you can end up like that. 
 I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off. 
 I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did. 
 So really, it's good luck. 
 Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs. 
 Ruby. Do you have a quarter? 
 (into phone) Peter, is Mom there? No, I need to speak to Mommy... Peter where's Mommy? No, I can't talk to you right now. Yeah... I hear it... look just tell her... No never mind... Go watch television. 
 Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK. 
 That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore. 
 Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out. 
 I only did it once and... 
 Get the fuck outta here man! 
 (screaming inside the booth) I said get the fuck outta here before I smash your fucking face in mothafucka!!! 
 I gotta go. I gotta find Telly. 
 Don't go anywhere. Stay with me. 
 I gotta find him. 
 I'm coming. 
 No. I just gotta go find him. 
 Jen! 
 (screaming) Jennie! 
 Hi Telly. Where you been? 
 Hi. 
 Hi Casper. 
 Any luck? 
 No none. 
 So, what are you gonna do for money this summer? 
 Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job. 
 That's right. 
 Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big. 
 Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties. 
 How do these things work? 
 How much you gonna take? 
 About ten. Fifteen is good. 
 Yeah probably. 
 Yo, you got any weed around here? 
 Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude. 
 Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles. 
 I'm gonna get mad diesel. I'm gonna fuck any nigga that tries to step to me. 
 Nah. 
 That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin natural. 
 Shh. 
 When are you gonna be back? 
 Four-thirty in the morning? 
 If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name. 
 Bye. 
 Shit. 
 (from the speaker, laughter and noise) Hello. 
 Hello Paul. Is Telly inside? 
 (laughing) Is Telly there? 
 This is Paul. Who is this? 
 It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there. 
 (drunkenly, laughter) Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me? 
 I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly? 
 Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.

 Suck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my dick. 
 (smiling) Now get in my way! Bitch. 
 Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? 
 Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest. 
 What? 
 Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin maybe. 
 No. I'm OK. Thanks. 
 You're OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean your a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all... 
 Yeah well, it's been a bad day. 
 A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul. 
 Sorry. 
 Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does. 
 You know. I could tell you were sad by the way your eyes drooped. Like an adopted kid. That's the way an adopted kid's eyes look. All sad like that. All droopy and sweet. Like the honey that I lick off my finger. 
 Would I be prying if I asked you what was wrong? 
 Miss, would I be prying? 
 Everything is wrong. 
 No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right? 
 Yeah, I guess so. 
 Did you and your boyfriend just break up? 
 No. 
 Are you in trouble with the law? 
 No. 
 Am I getting warm? 
 Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl. 
 Yeah? 
 Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth. 
 Hey look. Whatever it is. Just forget about it. Life's too short. Make yourself happy. I'll give you an example. When my golden retriever passed away. God rest his soul. (he punches the roof of the cab) I was lonesome. I missed him. So I got a tattoo. 
 Now how do you like that? Now he's with me forever. 
 I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy. 
 What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart? 
 Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier. 
 That's life. 
 Your a real philosopher. 
 Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell. 
 Well here we are, Miss. 
 Aw, don't worry 'bout it. The rides on me. 
 All right, all right, I'll take it. But forget about the tip. 
 Thanks. Bye. 
 Oh yeah. Oh Miss. Miss. When you smile, God notices. That's why the sun is shining. 
 Nuffin. What do you want? 
 You want Darcy? 
 Hold on. Let me see if she's here. 
 (his voice from upstairs) Darcy!!! 
 Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin. 
 Hey. 
 I was just getting ready to take a bath. 
 Hi Darcy. 
 (smiles, waves) Hi Kim. Hi Joy. 
 Right now? 
 (looks inside) Hold on. 
 So this is your new girl, huh? 
 You like 'em kinda young right. Babies? 
 Fuck you. 
 Damn bitch. Don't kill it. 
 Yo, you think we killed that guy? 
 Na. 
 You sure? 
 I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken. 
 Yo, we might have killed him. You think? 
 I don't think we killed him. Because after it was through, I saw him twitch. 
 Yeah, he was crawling around and shit. 
 Man we fucked him up. 
 Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka. 
 You guys are fucking sick. You know that? 
 That's OK. Cause that's how I'm livin. 
 Yep. 
 Ready. 
 Hey girl was up? 
 Just a lot of crazy shit. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. Have you seen Telly around? 
 Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid. 
 What happened? 
 I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit. 
 Do you know where he went? 
 I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now. 
 Who, Benny's little sister? 
 Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin? 
 Geez Kim. Your body looks fuckin good. 
 Thanks. 
 It's funny how sometimes you can't tell if a girl has a nice body until you see her without her clothes. 
 Hey Joy. You ever see a black man's lasso? 
 What? 
 
!!! 
 Hi ho Silver and away!!! 
 Oh shit it's fuckin cold. 
 Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps. 
 (surprised) You have? 
 At the block party? 
 You were? 
 I'll give you a dollar if you let me suck on your tit. 
 No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care. 
 Yeah me too. 
 Casper, why do you think I would let you suck on my boobs? 
 I don't know. Your just sitting there. And your tits look clean to me. It makes me  want to suck on 'em. 
 I thought you had a girlfriend. 
 No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends. 
 I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me. 
 I truth or dare you guys to kiss each other. 
 Sure. We kiss all the time. 
 You guys are dykes right? 
 No. 
 No. 
 Then how can you kiss each other like that? 
 Yeah. How can you do that shit? 
 It doesn't matter. It just feels good. That's all. 
 Yeah. It's not like we're gay. It's just kissing another person, a friend. 
 Yeah. 
 It's no big deal. 
 I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice. 
 Yeah. Do it again. 
 Tonight? 
 I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight. 
 Yeah? 
 Jennie! Was up girl? 
 Hi Sid. 
 Hi Jennie. 
 Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel? 
 Fine Fidget. What's all this? 
 Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle. 
 Now look at that. Amazing sexual exploration. 
 You don't have to look at us. It's not a free show. 
 Who are they? 
 I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin the effex. 
 Come on Jennie. Jen. 
 I got a present for you. 
 What is it? 
 Bang up stuff. 
 This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster. 
 No, Fidget, I... 
 Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it. 
 No... 
 Here. Swallow.

 Hey Casper. Why do they call you Casper? 
 'Cause Casper is my name. 
 But that's not your real name. No one's name is Casper. 
 Damn bitch. That's my name. Why do you always ask me the same shit? Why don't you go lose some fucking weight?

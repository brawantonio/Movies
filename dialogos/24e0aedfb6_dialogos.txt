 
 STUYVESANT) - MORNING 
 (clapping his hands) ... Let's go, people! Tardy lock- out starts in one minute! Get your butts in gear! One minute, people! Move it! 
 1994 
 (as Trevor passes) ... No ridin' bikes in 'a hallway, stoo-pit. 
 (catching his breath) ... No, bell hasn't rung yet. Okay, let's get inside. C'mon. (as they file into the room) ... Morning, morning. Rise and shine. 
 (shaking his head) ... You one crazy-ass nigga, G. 
 (a quarter stuck in one ear) ... Damn skippy. 
 Thank you for sharing, Auggie. 
 (provoking Auggie) ... Auggie doggie. 
 (O.S.) Fuck you, Tywan. Yer mama's a gangsta-rapper. 
 'Scuse me, you two... this isn't the Playboy Channel. 
 'Morning, Juanita. 
 (enthusiastically) Let's get started. August and Tywan, you pass out the books. Thank you, gentlemen. 
 Whas up wit' your car, G?   Yer Pinto blow up? 
 (good-natured smile) No, I don't own a Pinto, Tywan. (addressing the class) Okay, can I have everyone's attention? 
 The purpose of the bicycle is to demonstrate the principle of centripetal force. That's the opposite of the force we studied yesterday, which was... 
 Centrifugal force... Centripetal force is where the acceleration of a body moving in circular motion is directed toward its center by an opposing force, thus creating momentum that constrains the body to its circular path. Like a gyroscope. (sees nothing but yawns) It's better if I show you. Here, Tywan, you be my helper. 
 Tywan?   Come on. 
 Whad-up, G? (to rest of class) Hey, shut up! Y'all too damn loud, man! 
 I need you to demonstrate centripetal force. (removes briefcase from stool) Here, have a seat. 
 Okay, hold the bike steady with your knees. That's it. Seat positioned against your chest. 
 (to Auggie) Shut up, foo. 
 Okay, now crank the pedals and get that back wheel spinning about 180 R.P.M. 
 Whas up wit' dat? 
 (coaxing him along) You'll see. Be patient. 
 ... Put some muscle into it. 
 ... Keep pedaling. Harder. 
 (incredulous) Whas up? I tol' you you was crazy, man. 
 Now tilt the wheel to your right. 
 (eyes wide like a little kid) Aw, damn. I'm spinnin'.   Lookit me, Auggie! 
 (attempting unison) ... Tywan, Tywan, Tywan. 
 
 Okay, fellas, off the table. Put the Walkman away. I said put it away... 
 Walter, I need to speak with you. 
 (preoccupied) I'm pretty busy right now, Garfield. What is it? 
 Could you open it, please? 
 (a weary look of disgust) Don't suppose this kid cares about our budget crisis? (shuts the book) Have the textbook room charge him for the book. 
 One-Eight-Seven is a penal code number for murder, Walter. Means the same thing as T-O-S. 'Terminate On the Spot.' 
 (piqued) For chrissake, I know what it stands for. Look, kid probably heard it in a rap song. Doesn't mean anything. 
 ... The book belongs to Dennis Broadway. He's a known gangster, Walter -- a 'Five Percenter.' 
 Garfield, if I had a dollar for every time a student threatened faculty... Don't you think you're overreacting a little? 
 (suppressing trepidation) Did you tell Dennis Broadway he was getting a fail from me? 
 (stymied) I have legal access to those files. 
 He's a transfer from Nixon High School, isn't he? 
 (becoming defensive) Look, I'm not obligated to track you down every time a transfer student comes through here. You want confidential information like that, come look it up in his cum (cue-mm). 
 Do you have him on a contract? 
 If he gets through the semester without a fail then he gets to go back to Nixon, so what? 
 ... and be with his homeboys. 
 So he blew his opportunity. Now he has to learn to live with the consequences. 
 I don't think this kid's ready to deal with the consequences. I think he wants me dead. 
 Relax, has nothin' to do with you. 
 I should have been told, Walter. 
 Hey, I'm on your side, Garfield, but my hands are tied. Kid has a right to his privacy... Know what your problem is? You're an idealist. 
 What's wrong with that? 
 You only see what you wanna see, that's what's wrong. On one hand you think someone's trying to kill you. On the other hand you actually believe kids are paying attention in your classes. 
 (collecting himself) Never mind. It's not a problem. 
 (an empty promise) Tell you what, as soon as I get a chance I'll summons the kid. Promise. 
 Morning... 
 (V.O.) 'Morning, Mr. Garfield. This is the Sub Unit. Are you available for work? 
 (clearing his throat) ... Yes, uh huh. 
 (V.O.) There's a science class in the Valley at John Quincy Adams. It's a four day assignment. Teacher's name is Eskander. 
 A)   
 B)   
 C)   
 D)   
 (V.O.) (kneeling bedside) ... If you're listening, God, please help me today. All I ask is a chance to do my job... t'do the job you put me here to do in the first place. (prayerfully now) Please help me accept those things I cannot change... and give me strength to change those things I can. (beat) ... This is me, Trevor, God. Amen. 
 "A" BUILDING - MORNING 
 
 ... Baseball cap, give it up. 
 (stopping Trevor now) Hold it, please. 
 I'm a substitute. 
 (pointing) Okay, you want the Main Office, straight ahead. Check in with Mrs. Ford. 
 ... 'Scuse me. I'm lost. I'm looking for Bungalow... (checks homeroom roster) ... eighty-six. 
 #1 (pointing) All the way out, next to the parking lot. Last bungalow on the left. 
 ... Thank you. 
 #1 (fatalistic) Good luck. 
 TREVOR'S POV 
 (O.S.) (like,    a buzzer; times    up) ... EEEEgghh!     Wrong. William, you know this.     C'mon, how do you find the pound    sign? What's the fastest way? 
 (playfully) You're not thinking. (a major clue) How 'bout Binary search. 
 (the answer) You split them! 
 (amused) ... Very funny. 
 So who yuh here for? 
 Eskander. 
 (zipping up, exiting) Aw, man, you got bungalow duty. 
 ... Hey, ese(s)?! 
 (knowing full well) What the hell's going on here, lil' sister? 
..." 
 ... Before taking roll, I'd like to prove a point. 
 (Armenian; a disparaging laugh) 'Farfie?' (cholo-like) Whad up, Farfie? 
 ... It's not important what... or who... 'Farfie' is. 
 Yuh wanna play, yuh gotta stay. Have a seat, please. 
 (pacing now) The point I'd like to make is this... Anyone here can be a scientist. 
 (sotto; puzzled) ... What's he talking about? 
 ... A scientist is like a detective. He investigates data. He scratches the surface of things he doesn't understand to see what's underneath. (pointing to blackboard) ... Things like this. Okay, who wants to read? 
 (standing up) I'll do it. 
 Come on, we don't need disrespect. Let 'im do it. (to Barsek) What's your name? 
 Barsek. 
 Okay, Barsek.     Read. 
 ... Glis was very frapper. She had denarpen Farfie's Mardsen. She couldn't galp a giberter for Farfie. Instead she wharked to plimp a mardsen binky for him. 
 Okay, anyone know what Barsek just said? 
 That's alright. You don't need to understand something to answer a few simple questions about it. Every one of you is capable of decoding data. Watch. 
 ... Why was Glis Frapper?   Can anyone tell me? 
 (pointing at Asian Girl) Okay. 
 (slowly; cautiously) ... Glis was frapper... because... she had denarpen Farfie's mardsen? 
 (understated) That's right. You got it. (reactions all around) Let's try another. 
 ... What did Glis plimp? 
 (searching blackboard ledge) ... Hold on, hold on. Where's your teacher keep the chalk? 
 ... In the desk. 
 (O.S.) ... Can I help you? 
 Sorry I'm late. Had to handle something. You a sub? 
 (puzzled) I thought this was Science. Ms. Eskander. 
 No. This is Dave Childress, American History. 
 ... Don't know how to break it to you... (glancing at Trevor's name again) ... Garfield... but this is bungalow 84. 
 See, you zigged when you shoulda zagged. Course it's not your fault someone jacked the number off my door. Keep askin' Garcia to fix it but all I get is 'nada.' 
 ... that mess over there, that's Eskander's. 
 You our sub? 
 It's not real. We're studying teen parenting in home-ec.' It's computerized, so it cries and shit. 
 (addressing Benny; without prejudging) You know how the books got outside? 
 No speaky Engless. 
 You speak Spanish, Mister... Whas yer name? 
 Garfield. 
 ... You speak Spanish, Mister G? (as Trevor ignores the question) Eh, G... know what dat means when a homeboy calls you 'G'? Dat means gangster, homes. You a gangster, maestro? 
 No, I'm not a gangster. (beat) Would you please do me a favor and pick up the books? 
 (righteous indignation) Andate a la mierda. (more laughs) I ain't pickin' dat shit up.   You go pick it up. 
 What's your name? 
 Cesar Chavez.    Don't you recognize me? 
 See dis? I'm already on house arrest, homes. Ain't nothin' more you can do to me. 
 Sit down, please. 
 (peeking Benny's hold card) Mr. G, those guys that jus' walked out aren't even in here this period. (pointing to Benny) And this fool's name is Benny Chacon. 
 (whirls in his seat) Shut yer mouth, hood rat! School girl bitch! 
 Okay, Benny.   That's enough. 
 Hey, you ain't no real teacher. Fool, you're nothin' but a sub. T'ink yer so cool... You mus' be 'Mr. culo.' 
 (a cool curiosity) Why do you wear a rosary? 
 (reacting) Ain't none a' yer damn business. To put God on me, okay? Why don't you jus' go sit down and read yer newspaper. Wanna-be, mother fucker. 
 Are you done? 
 Jus' gimme a referral.    Shit. 
 (cool deliberation) For future reference, anyone who disrupts a class, or in any way infringes on the rights of others to get an education, is subject to disciplinary action. (beat) When I'm here, ladies and gentlemen, I expect to be treated decently... (walks back to Benny) ... hopefully in an atmosphere of mutual respect. This classroom is our sanctuary, yours and mine. Respect it. (handing Benny the referral) For your information, I am a real teacher. 
 Whatever you say, Opie. 
 Okay, who would like to help me pick up the books? 
 How goes the battle, Garfield? 
 D'juh get that binky marsden farfied? 
 Know what I think? I think that Chacon punk's the one who opened your bungalow this morning. (another bite) Eskander doesn't know how to lock a window. 
 ... Come by the lab after school, we'll work on it... 
 Want some advice? 
 First homeboy that gives you the slightest bit of trouble... send 'um tuh Larry Hyland. He's their counselor. Right off the bat, yuh have to sacrifice one. Let 'um know who's boss. Show some balls. (as Trevor nods) And don't look for support from the administration. Most of 'em haven't been in a classroom in ten years. They don't know shit. I got tenure and I'm still out here in the damn bungalows. I should be in the 'A' building with a nice air-conditioned room. (sarcastically) You met Garcia yet? The principal? 
 Ah!  New blood! (extends a hand) Ellen Henry, computer science. 
 Trevor Garfield. 
 Nice scar yuh got there. 
 Ever sub here before? 
 First time. 
 (curiously) What about permanent? 
 I taught seven years in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Roosevelt Whitney High School. 
 Roosevelt Whitney? Didn't some teacher get stabbed to death there last year? 
 Actually, he survived. 
 No, it was on 'Sixty Minutes.' Some gangbanger stabbed this guy with a ten-penny nail like a dozen times in a hallway and... 
 Jesus Christ, you're him.   It was you. 
 (awestruck) Holy shit, Garfield. When was that? December before last? No, it was fall. 
 October 27. 
 Whadda schmuck. I'm sittin' here givin' advice to a man with a purple heart. 
 Excuse me... 
 (sotto) Lemme tell yuh somethin'. In my book you're a fuckin' hero. Damn straight. 
 ... Getting stabbed doesn't make me a hero. 
 (disregards Trevor's comment) So what'd they give the kid? 
 They put 'im upstate in a facility until his twenty-first birthday. 
 That all? They shoulda caned the bastard. Like they did that kid in Singapore. Remember? (recollecting) President of Singapore had a few choice words. Use to have it memorized... He said something like, 'When a state of increasing disorder and defiance cannot be checked by the rules... then new and sometimes drastic rules have to be forged to maintain order.' (slides Trevor a glance) 'The alternative is to surrender order to chaos and anarchy.' 
 So why do you still teach? 
 Same reason as you, Garfield -- for the paycheck. 
 Okay, someone tell me the difference between the central nervous system and the lymphatic system? 
 (obscenely) Mr. G, you gotta nice butt. 
 You seem to be an expert on anatomy, Miss -- (checks roster) -- Nartinez. Central nervous system and lymphatic system. What's the difference? 
 ... Uh... 
 It's like the central nervous system, that's your brain and spinal cord, and the lymphatic system, that's the stuff in your blood that fights diseases. 
 Very good. 
 Cesar. 
 You writing on your desk? 
 (coolly) You see anything in my hands? (displaying his empty palms) I don't think so. 
 K-O-S, what's that? That a tagging crew? 
 Cartoon... Is that you, Cesar? (off no response) 'K-O-S' has something to do with your friend Benny? 
 ... Dawg. You're a sucker. K-O-S stands for 'Kappin' Off Suckers.' Don't disrespect my homeboy, Benny. He don't like it. He don't like you. 
 Do me a favor, Cesar. Go get a paper towel from the counter and wipe off your desk. (beat) And Mr. Littleton, please oblige me and turn that tagger shirt inside-out. 
 (refusing) Hyland said it was okay, Sucker. 
 (self-conscious) Don't pay no attention to them. They jus' tryin' tuh fuck wit' you, Mr. G. I mean play wit' you. (beat) Sorry I said you had a nice ass. 
 (a pensive beat) ... Apology accepted. 
 (in her own defense) I ain't no school girl. 
 God forbid anyone should think that. 
 
 (AFTER SCHOOL) 
 May I come in? 
 Yeah... (points at her) ... Ellen. 
 (pointing back) Trevor. 
 (explaining) I'm making time a reward instead of a distraction. 
 Clever... Listen, I wanted to apologize for jumping up like I did at lunch. I was just feeling a little weird... 
 It's alright. 
 For what it's worth, Dave Childress thinks you walk on water. 
 Is that a good thing? 
 I think it takes a lot of courage to go back into a classroom after something like that. 
 Not if the only thing you ever wanted to do was teach. 
 (smiles) Now you see, there's our predicament. 
 I assume you've met Benny Chacon? 
 I have. 
 (absently) Last week Benny and his tagging crew had Ms. Eskander pinned in the corner over there. (pointing) ... She's seven months pregnant and he's tormenting her with a broom handle... Can I help you with those? 
 No thanks. 
 So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny... and if the district construes it as assault and battery on a student, she's gone. 
 They'd do that? 
 In a heart beat. She's non- tenured, they don't want to get sued... (with resignation) Don't be surprised if she files for stress leave by the end of the week. Too bad, too. She's a good teacher. 
 Can I ask you a personal question? 
 (tentatively now) Why'd that kid attack you? 
 Because I flunked him. 
 (sobered) Is there any way you can see something like that coming? 
 When they say they wanna kill you, you'd best take it serious. This kid was an O.T. -- Opportunity Transfer -- but nobody told me until it was too late. 
 Did you know Benny's an O.T.?... In less than a year he's been convicted of felony assault and suspended twice. I even testified against him as a character witness. Now I get to see him every day in homeroom. I'm stuck with him. Condition of his probation is that he stay in school. 
 You talk to the principal? 
 Many times... Three weeks ago, Garcia calls Benny's mother in for a conference, but she refuses to show up. She's afraid they'll deport her because she's illegal. So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and some attorney tells her she doesn't have to come in. (still can't believe) Garcia got cold feet and dropped the whole thing. (fear building) This kid's threatening me and all he's worried about is a lawsuit. 
 (intent now) What'd Benny say to you? 
 That he wanted to hurt me.   Real bad. 
 Does he know where you live? 
 I think so. Someone's been phoning me at night and hanging up... Two weeks ago, my car was broken into... And last Friday, I think he was inside my house... But I can't prove it. 
 (bottom lip quivers) ... I don't know what to do. 
 You can quit. 
 You didn't. 
 Do I know you? 
 (indicates tagging) You should. You're fuckin' with my piece, puto. 
 (nervously) ... You from K.O.S.? No shit? 
 (panicking) Look, I didn't mean nothin'. Lemme fix it. I can fix it. Okay? 
 (to Cesar) Eh, shut up, mojado! (to Tagger now) Don't mess wit' me, whiteboy.    I'll cap yer ass. 
 I said shut up! Shut the fuck up! 
 (reacting to message) I don't have no time to put up wit' 'dis shit! 
 You think it's funny?! 
 I don't call my P.O. in 15 minutes, I'm fucked. 
 Dis is K.O.S.' neighborhood. 
 (FIRST PERIOD) 
 (O.S.) Sergio Arrellano... Blanca Orantes... Andrew Blackwell... Benny Chacon... 
 (chiming in) Benny's not here. 
 I think he went AWOL, Mr. G. 
 (O.S.) (muted) ... Trevor. 
 (quietly) Eskander filed for stress leave. They want me to finish out the semester. 
 That's great... 
 (with humility) It's only 'til the end of the year. 
 Listen, I never thanked you for letting me cry on your shoulder. 
 That's okay. 
 (digressing now) Hey, have you seen Benny lately? (as Trevor shrugs) Ford told me he hasn't phoned his P.O. in four days. (weighs guilt; whispering) You know what they say. Be careful what you pray for. Don't get me wrong, Benny's made my life a living hell. I even moved back in with my mother because of him. I love my mother, but if I eat one more dinner off a TV tray or watch one more rerun of 'Wheel of Fortune,' I think I'll lose my fucking mind. 
 (to class) Time's up. Everyone stop working. 
 (breaks the silence) ... So you have a wife hiding in a closet somewhere? 
 (smile widens) No.   No wife. 
 Don't you ever get lonely? 
 (genuinely) Sometimes. There's this passage in God's Lonely Man by Thomas Wolfe where he says, '... The whole conviction of my life rests upon the belief that loneliness is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.' I believe that. 
 God that's depressing. 
 ... My New York mentality. (beat) It's not always easy looking on the bright side. 
 Especially after spending a year in and out of a hospital, I would guess. 
 Actually, that wasn't the toughest part -- it's the robbery that's been hardest to recover from. 
 (didn't know about this) What'd they steal? (CONTINUED) 
 My passion. My old, unguarded self. I resent that. I want them back. 
 They're still there. Everybody around me seems to have given up. They're all so beaten down. But you're different. You refuse to be beaten. 
 So do you. 
 Remember the last time a student surprised you? 
 You mean where a light goes on? 
 Yeah. Where the kid surpasses all your expectations. 
 ... Been awhile. So few you can actually get through to... You? 
 (thinks) ... That would have to be Daniel Terrazas. This was last year sometime. Kid was failing miserably ... But he was the best Salsa dancer in the whole school. 
 (brightens slightly) Uh-oh. 
 So I made 'im a deal. Tutoring in exchange for Salsa lessons. 
 Saw it... Jerry Springer. 
 No, no. He was a perfect gentleman. 
 (dryly) Male teachers can't do things like that. They get arrested. 
 Yep, double standard... By the way, did you know Cesar Sanchez was Special Ed? (as Trevor shakes his head) Yep, he never should've been mainstreamed. His I.E.P. says he's L.H. but he acts more like S.E.D. 
 Severely Emotionally Disturbed... that's great. 
 Come on, Garfield -- on your feet. Lemme teach you how to Salsa. 
 (resisting) No, no, I'm no good at that. 
 Let's go.   Don't play shy with me, homeboy. 
 (still holding wine glass) That's it... Okay, follow me. It starts on the one. Step forward with your left foot... One. Change weight on, two. (MORE) 
 ELLEN (CONT'D) And three, feet back together... Now do the same in reverse, starting with your right foot. (talks their way through) One, two, three... One, two three... 
 (horrified, giggling) Oh, my God... your shirt.   Oh, no, I'm so sorry. 
 (self-conscious) It's alright. 
 Can I help? 
 (O.S.) Grab the baking soda outta the fridge. 
 Don't start barking, Jack. 
 (petting him) Hey there, boy. You're a good dog. Yes, you are. 
 Sorry for reacting the way I did back there. 
 Don't apologize. That's how most people react. 
 Didn't scare me. It just surprised me. 
 ... Thanks for dinner.   I had a good time. 
 You're welcome. 
 Here... you need a little life in that place of yours. 
 ... Good night. 
 (a half-wave) ... Night. 
 (addressing class) Since some of you seem to have an interest in anesthetics, I've prepared a little demonstration. 
 Rita, bring your friend in the cage over here, please. 
 His name's Snowball. Like 'dat lil' pig dude from Animal Farm. 
 (coolly impressed) You've read Animal Farm? 
 (above the din) ... schoolgirl. 
 (snapping a look) Shut up, Cesar. 
 You read Animal Farm, Cesar? 
 No, but I fucked a sheep. 
 Cesar, come up here. (gesturing) I want you to have a front row seat for this. 
 And remove the 'lokes.' 
 Why your eyes so red? 
 (lying) Mus' be pink-eye, sir. 
 (eyes Trevor's pocket watch) Nice watch, homes. Can I have it? 
 (pointing) Rita, would you bring me a sugar cube from the shelf over there? 
 (referring to text) Cesar, read Young's rule for us. Page 564. At the top. 
 (like it's above him) I ain't gonna read 'dat shit. 
 Rita, give Cesar your book.    Let 'im read. 
 Forget it. 
 (prompting him) 'Young's rule...' Go on. 
 (reacting) ... Chunt. (Choont.) 
 Stoopit bitch. 
 Touch her again, Cesar, and you'll answer to me personally. 
 You like her, Mr. G? 
 (shrinking) Shut up! 
 (genuinely) Settle down, everyone. We all have to learn how to forgive and get along. C'mon, Cesar, read. Please. 
 (attempting to read) ... Young's rule... ff... fo... 
 ... Formulates. 
 ... I say everyone deserves another chance. Whadda you say, Cesar? 
 Rita, would you please read Young's rule for me? 
 (hesitates and...) ... 'Young's rule formulates proper dosage levels for children and adolescents.' 
 Thank you. 
 ... In the brown bottle I have a prescription for liquid Demeral. 
 Where'd that come from, sir? 
 A doctor. 
 Demeral is a morphine sulphate... and is soluble in water. 
 Young's rule says, divide the age of the patient by the patient's age plus twelve, giving us the fraction of the adult dosage suitable for the patient. (MORE) 
 TREVOR (CONT'D) In Snowball's case, I've calculated the dosage necessary to tranquilize a one-year-old child... then further divided that fraction by 30, based on his weight, to arrive at .002 milligrams. 
 ... Don't worry, he'll be back to normal in exactly 10 minutes. 
 ... He shoulda woke up by now? 
 (accusatory) You just caught a murder case, homes. 
 Okay, anyone who didn't finish answering the questions on 246, finish them for homework. 
 Hold it, Cesar. 
 Where's my watch? 
 (urgently) Hey, I gotta go. I ain't got no watch. 
 Empty your pockets, both of you. 
 Want me to break it down to you? I gotta catch a bus. 
 (making excuses) Sorry. I'm trying to catch Hyland before he leaves. 
 I've been meaning to come by your room. 
 (keeping it light) ... It's almost been a week.   My guess is you're avoiding me. 
 You okay? 
 Has nothing to do with you, Ellen. It's... hard for me... 
 Pretty much been like that since... you know, my accident. Has nothing to do with you. 
 Is it because I'm white? 
 No. 
 We can still be friends.   Just don't pull away. 
 (back to lighter note) Now, can I ask you a favor? After you're done with Hyland, can you give me a ride to my car? It's at the mechanics, about five or six blocks up Lankershim. If you can't, it's okay, I can walk. 
 (a little embarrassed) ... I think I can manage that. 
 Que paso, Victor? 
 (into walkie-talkie) Base three to base one. 'Found 'im. 
 Mr. Garcia would like to speak with you in his office. 
 MR. GARCIA You don't mind if I tape record our conversation. Matter of record. You understand. (indicating Mr. Hyland) Of course, you know Mr. Hyland. 
 Am I being questioned? 
 MR. GARCIA (beat) Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Littleton tell me you've accused them of stealing your watch. If that's the case, I need to address the accusation. 
 ... For the record, I primarily suspect Mr. Sanchez. Although I wouldn't be surprised if Stevie was an accomplice. (glances over at Cesar and Stevie) Beginning of sixth period, Cesar admired the watch. I believe his exact words were, 'Can I have it?' (looks back to Garcia) Either way, I'd like my watch back. 
 MR. GARCIA Anything else? 
 When I asked him to empty his pockets, Cesar refused. 
 MR. GARCIA Is that true, Mr. Sanchez? 
 No way. He never asked me nothin' like that! I don't go 'round taxing no teachers... 
 MR. GARCIA Okay.   Calm down. 
 ... I ain't got no watch, man. 
 MR. GARCIA Mr. Littleton, may we see your pockets too? 
 (last try) I'd like a locker search, please. 
 MR. GARCIA You're excused, gentlemen.   Take your things. Thank you. 
 MR. GARCIA (unflinching pragmatism) ... Let me try and explain something. I try and think of our students here at John Quincy Adams like they're my clients. I can't accuse anybody just on your hunches. I need more than that. I need facts. (looking at Hyland) I won't have another law suit like we did with that Blackwell case. (now to Trevor) Boy's mother spent $400 that she couldn't afford on new clothes for her son. Unfortunately we considered the clothing gang attire and sent the boy home. That cost the district a quarter of a million dollars. (beat) So I want you to be straight with me, Mr. Garfield. Did you physically see Cesar take your watch? 
 No, I didn't... 
 MR. GARCIA Do you have any witnesses who saw him take it? 
 (pause) ... No. 
 MR. GARCIA Unless there's reasonable cause to show that Cesar, or Mr. Littleton took your watch then I can't authorize a locker search. I'm sorry. Any concerns regarding my decision, you can look up in the handbook. It's section 628.1 of the Education Code. 
 (to Garcia) That was my grandfather's watch. Can't you see what they're doing? Weren't you ever a teacher? 
 MR. GARCIA Afraid I never had the privilege. Teaching and being a principal don't necessarily go hand in hand, Mr. Garfield. 
 (sotto) Is it me or is Garcia a real asshole? 
 I've been thinking about videotaping my classes. 
 ... Yeah, well, here's some free advice. Cover your ass. 
 If Garcia asks, your main purpose is to observe you, not the students. Excuse me, I mean his `clients.' 
 Some gangbanger might think we're violating his civil rights... 
 (into phone) ... Yeah? 
 (into phone) Sorry, Iris. Completely forgot. 
 (to Trevor) Yuh have a minute? Wanna talk to you about our discipline committee. Gotta run up to the office real quick first. 
 Yeah, fine, go ahead.   I'll wait. 
 ... I have to fly up there for a computer conference. 
 When's that? 
 Day after tomorrow. 
 Never been to San Francisco. 
 (V.O.) Oh, you should go sometime, Trevor. I think you'd like it. Really. It's only an hour by air. Maybe five or six by car. Completely different attitude from L.A. Much more like a real city... like Chicago or New York... 
 (V.O.) ... Only problem is I hate to leave Jack with my mother for any extended period of time. I'm afraid she'll forget to feed him and he'll starve to death. 
 If you want, I'll take care of Jack. 
 I can't ask you to do that. 
 (straight at Ellen now) Sure you can. 
 (continues working) ... Aren't you supposed to be at P.E. fifth period? 
 (rants; kicks a desk) ... Sunland Boyz gettin' crazy, ol lady's... fucked up. Fuck dis being down shit. I wanna do somethin' wit' my life. 
 
 ... You know this guy? 
 (unravels now; begins to cry) 'Gotta make J-C next year. 'Got to! I ain't never gonna get up outta here. 
 Rita, slow down. 
 'Dat bitch Quinn, I'm 'onna sue her ass. 'Swear tuh God... 
 Okay, okay.   Calm down a second. 
 Who's Quinn?    What's she teach? 
 English Comp.    She's failin' me. 
 'Bitch say I don't talk right. 
 She hates me.    She's racist against me. 
 Just cause you're a Latina doesn't mean everyone's racist against you. 
 (prideful) Hey, I'm a La Raza, prof-eh. 
 Okay... just stop blaming everyone else. You're too smart for that. (as Rita's rocked back) And every mistake in that essay is fixable, okay? So relax, it's not the end of the world. 
 (points to counter) Tissues are in the first drawer. 
 (innocuously) How come you always wear so much makeup? 
 (wounded) ... To make me pretty. 
 (frankly) You don't need it. 
 (slightest bit probative) That your name? 
 (with fervor and frustration) It's a gang thing. But I'm kickin' dat shit... Jus' cuz I look down for my neighborhood don't mean I'm stupit. 
 I know you're not. 
 (offers) The ideas in your essay aren't the problem, Rita. It's your punctuation and grammar. (beat) They need work. Am I lying? (as Rita shrugs) If you want help I'm here for you. Okay? 
 (tentatively now) ... I dunno. 
 Have to be in the library after school. 
 (shaking her head) ... Somebody could see us. 
 All right then, I'll come to your house. 
 (spontaneous and decisive) No... No way. 
 Where then?   You name the place. 
 (6TH PERIOD) 
 
 (grumbling) Dog, you invadin' my privacy. Bitch. 
 (remaining calm) Cesar, would you come up here please? 
 (calmly) Since you were so concerned, I though you might like to know... I found my watch. 
 ... You broke into my locker. Dat's a serious felony, prof-eh. You caught a case for sure now. 
 Whadda yuh propose to do, Cesar? Tell Garcia? (as Cesar weighs it) Whadda yuh gonna tell 'im? That I broke into your locker to steal back the watch you denied taking? I don't think so. I'd say we're even now, wouldn't you, Cesar? 
 No, I'd say we're just getting started, ese. 
 Want something to drink?    We have Coke, Fanta or Sprite... 
 (self-consciously) ... Coke's awright. 
 (to Rita offstage) 'Want you to know, you're not the only one risking a reputation here. Normally I don't tutor students at my house. (adds ice cubes) Rita, maybe you can clear something up. Can you explain to me what machismo is all about? Cuz this whole respect/code of honor thing baffles me. 
 (preoccupied) Ask yourself this question. Is pride really that important? 
 (plainly) Put your clothes on, Rita. 
 (affected) No harm done... Don't cry now. 
 Why don't you go ahead and copy the first rule there for the verb 'to be.' Can you do that for me? 
 (hiccups a sob) I jus' wan'ed to thank you. 
 You don't have to thank me, I'm your teacher. 
 ... From now on I think the best thing for us to do is meet in the library. 
 (prayerfully, to himself ... I'll try. 
 MRS. SANCHEZ                                          * (on the verge              (subtitles... You stay of tears)                 out of my ... Deja mis cosas, Cesar.     things, Cesar. You hear Me oyes? Ese dinero es         me? That money puts para poner comida en el        food on your baby plato de tu hermanita.         sister's plate. 
 (indicating door) I ain't getting it. You get it. 
. 
 MRS. SANCHEZ                                                * (O.S.)                    (subtitlesYes, who's Si, quien es?                     there?) 
 MRS. SANCHEZ (O.S.) (surprised) Si, maestro. 
 MRS. SANCHEZ (O.S.) Entre, por favor. 
 
 Hello, Cesar. 
 MRS. SANCHEZ                                              * (beside herself)            (subtitlesI don't know No se que hacer, maestro.       what to El no hace caso.                do, maestro. He doesn't listen to me.) 
 (indicating bruise)        (subtitlesHow'd that Como paso eso? Arriba del       happen... ojo?                            above your eye?) 
 MRS. SANCHEZ Nada... es nada. 
 (venting rage) Puto! You lied to Benny. You said you don't speak no Spanish! 
 No I didn't. 
 'At's bullshit! 
 Enjoy hitting your mother, Cesar? You must be proud of yourself. 
 (to gangbangers) ... He's lyin', man. (at Trevor) Fuckin' liar! Homeboy don't never disrespec' his mother. Never. You hear me, joto?! 
 Whatever you say, Cesar. 
 I'll find out where you stay. Trucha, homes! 
 Valla ala chingada! 
 (pushing through) 'Scuse me. What's going on? (and) Lakesia, who opened the door? 
 It was like that when I got here. 
 Whoever did this is gonna pay! Better believe it, ese(s). 
 (crazed now) Get the hell outta here! 
 Dave... (to Armenian kid) Barsek, don't touch anything, okay? 
 Get out!! 
 (an incredulous, sickened laugh) Oh, damn. Lookit the rat. 
 Think it's funny?! Huh?!       Yuh little fuck! 
 Dave!   No!   Let go of 'im! 
 (to Barsek) D'you do this?! 
 (choking) Nooo... 
 He didn't do anything.    He's a good kid. 
 (glances around; sniffs) Been smokin' the chronic, Cesar? 
 (a smirk) I'm hooked on phonics... not 'hooked on chronic.' 
 (not amused) You wouldn't happen t'know who vandalized bungalow eighty-six last night? 
 (feigning ignorance) You guys know anything about that? (off silence) Sorry, maestro... nada. 
 (sotto) Garcia may not think there's enough here to prove anything. But you and I both know who's responsible. Don't we? 
 Whadda you, a narc? Seriously, I don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about. 
 (pointing) The ring, Cesar... lemme have it. 
 Watch it, eh... that's my trigger finger. 
 It's inappropriate attire... 
 ... Bang. 
 (momentous deliberation) ... Are you finished? 
 What? Finished with what?   Don't get crazy on me, dude. 
 - 
 ... These conferences mainly focus on software now. 
 (far off) Software sells. 
 (flickers a smile) So, how's Jack? 
 ... Jack's good. 
 (flirtatious) And what about Trevor?   Was Trevor a good boy, too? 
 (self-consciously) What's that supposed to mean? 
 (innocently) Nothing... 
 Is that supposed to mean something? 
 (baffled) Trevor... 
 Can't you see I'm talking to the lady?! 
 ... I'm sorry.     Forgive me. 
 
 ... Come out, come out, wherever you are. Where is he? 
 
 (tentatively) Jack? 
 Here, boy... here, Jack.   Come to Mommy, sweetheart. 
 (reacting) ... Oh, my God. 
 (right behind Trevor) Jack?! 
 (gut-wrenching) Jack! 
 ... Jack. 
 (offering pill) It's aspirin... 
 (refuses it) ... I can't talk to you right now, Trevor. Please. I'm so upset I can't even drive. I just need some time alone. 
 (beat) I know about what's not fair. I left part of my lung in a damn hospital because some gangbanger didn't like the grade I gave him. Sometimes you do all the right things. You work hard in school... get a good job... pay your taxes. Things still go bad. (eyes flicker) I'm so sorry, Ellen. 
 ... 'At you, Stevie? 
 (startled) ... Hells, man. Stupit dog. 
 ... Mutha fuck. 
 Trevor? 
 Trevor? 
 ... Where'd you put the aspirin? 
 
 My finger. Please, somebody help me! Where's my finger?! 
 ... I put it on my mother, sir. 
 #1 (leaning forward; good cop) ... So your science teacher shot you with an arrow full of drugs then chopped off your finger. Come on, you can do better than that, Cesar. 
 It had to be him! 
 #2 (bad cop) He smoke the `mota' for yuh, too, eh ese? 
 Pinche madre... he hates my guts, man! 
 #2 You covering for somebody, homes? (MORE) 
 DETECTIVE #2 (CONT'D) Cuz, this circumstantial bullshit won't hold up in court, I'll tell you that right now. 
 #1 (sadly) Caught too many priors, Cesar. Juvenile GTA, vandalism... 
 I know he did it! Don't you hear what I'm saying? 
 #1 You saw his face? 
 (lying) Yeah, yeah. I seen him. 
 #2 Lemme save yuh from perjuring yourself, asshole... You're full of shit. 
 I swear it!   For reals! 
 #2 (turns to leave) C'mon, this guy's wasting our time. (points to Cesar) Come up with something better than that, or the truth, then maybe we'll talk. 
 
 (addressing class) ... Name one of four parts that make up the human hand? 
 ... Hands, please. 
 Christian. 
 ... The metacarpals. 
 The Metacarpals. That's one. (to class) Name some more? 
 Rita. 
 The wrist... and thumb. 
 Good. (holding up all his fingers now) ... And don't forget the phalanges. 
 (in unison) Phalanges, phalanges, phalanges... 
 
 May I come in? 
 (reticently) Hi. 
 (concerned) Where'd you go the other night? 
 I was going to ask you the same thing. 
 ... I went for a run. (changes subject) Wanna get some Chinese later? There's a new place in the Valley Center. 'Spose to be pretty good. 
 (an excuse) ... Can't tonight. Maybe another time. 
 (stands there for a moment) ... I should probably correct papers anyway. Some of these bungalow kids actually care about a grade. Even Cesar's doing better. Today, for the first time since I took over for Eskander, he actually did his work. (beat) Today Cesar Sanchez was a success. Maybe for the first time in his life. (blinks now) You alright? 
 ... Much better, thank you. 
 ... I really am sorry about Jack. 
 ... Finished. 
 ... Let's hava look.. 
 ... Good. (deliberating) ... I was just thinking, since your essay's about gangs and getting away from their influence, you probably could've left some of those double negatives you like so well. 
 (confused) So now you wan' me to use bad grammar. 
 (explaining) Only if it suits your topic. 
 I know. We're all products of our environment 'n' shit. 
 No, I think that's just an excuse. (beat) I say if we're strong, we can rise above adversity. (lets it sink in) But it's like rap or hip-hop... Correct all the grammar and it loses its impact. 
 So you like hip-hop, Mr. G? 
 (shakes his head) ... I hate it. 
 (reacting) What kinda black man are you? 
 Why you here anyways? Don't you got nothin' better t'do? 
 ... Everything I wanna do is right here. (back on track now) It's a good essay, Rita. You put a lot of effort into it, it shows. 
 (a laconic grin) Comes from the heart, maestro. I'm a writer... not a fighter. 
 (hinting now) ... Ms. Quinn was telling me she picks two seniors each year to read their essays at graduation. 
 (taken aback) She ain't gonna pick my paper. Anyway, I don't wanna get up in fronna all those people and make a fool outta myself. 
 Why not?   It'd be a Pyrrhic victory. 
 What's dat? 
 ... In your case, irony. Refers to King Pyrrhus. Never mind. Look it up sometime. 
 (5TH PERIOD) 
 ... Before getting side-tracked with viruses and T-S-R programs, we were talking yesterday about E-Mail. 
 If you click-on the mail icon in your tray, you'll be ready to send and receive mail. My computer's already set-up. Everyone go ahead and click the white envelope in the lower... 
 Looks like someone's way ahead of me. Alright. (adapts and demonstrates) To retrieve your mail simply double click the top item in your mail list. (as she does) Since we're all a part of the same network, we share mail... so go ahead and do that. 
 Whoever sent that message isn't as anonymous as they think. 
 'Dat's bullshit, man! 
 You best step off, Ms. H. Cuz you can't prove nuthin'. And I know you can't afford to lose 'dis minimum wage job 'a yers. 
 (beat and) You're right, Stevie. I can't afford to live in a big house south of the boulevard. Like you do. 
 Iris, did Steven Littleton come in here? 
 Haven't seen 'im. 
 #1 (appalled) You're not supposed to leave your classroom unattended. 
 (reacting) Sue me. 
 (51). 
 (offers; sotto) Benny Chacon's mother. Told 'er Garcia had to leave early today but she jus' sits there. She been saying some pretty crazy things. 
 (to Mrs. Chacon) ... Espanol, muy poquito, senora. (beat) Mrs. Chacon... you have to slow down. (back to Iris) What's she saying? 
 You heard 'bout that body they foun' in the L.A. River... She says she thinks it's Benny. 
 ASST. CORONER You say he's been missing approximately four weeks? 
 ... Four, almost five weeks. 
 ASST. CORONER That's a long time. Lots a things happen to a body after four or five weeks. Makes it difficult to I.D. 
 (indicating John Doe) So he just sits here? 
 ASST. CORONER We keep 'um up to thirty days. Lady, we get 80, sometimes 90 Does a month. Floaters, gangbangers, illegals, junkies. Most of 'um cheap homicides. Nobody's even lookin' for 'em. (indicating folder) This guy here, has a dent in his head. Could be post-mortem trauma. Probably hit a retaining wall on his way down river after that rain we had. Who knows. (beat) Yuh ask me, this kid was dead before he got his head caved in. Overdose by morphine. That's what it looks like t'me. 
 ASST. CORONER On the phone you said the mother mentioned some identifying marks. 
 (affirmative) She said he has some pockmarks on his chest; from a bad case of chicken pox. And there's a bar- code tattoo on his neck. 
 MRS. CHACON ... Benito. 
 (to Assistant Coroner; sotto) Did you find any rosary beads with the body? 
 No. 
 ... Who's there? 
 (O.S.) You should keep your door locked. 
... 
 (still half asleep) What's the matter? 
 (impaling him with a look) I just want you to tell me one thing... 
 (off Ellen's puzzled look) What? 
 What is it? 
 ... If you had any idea what I've been thinking lately... you'd think I was crazy. (running it through her mind) ... Remember that John Doe they found in the L.A. River. Turned out it was Benny. 
 (impacted) Who told you that? 
 ... Benny's mother identified the body. 
 Benny was no saint, Ellen. This is a kid who terrorized hald the school. He even broke into your house. Maybe we should think about that 'fore we shed any tears. 
 ... Maybe he's better off. 
 That's a horrible thing to say. 
 Do you believe for every troubled kid like Benny there's one or two others just waiting to take his place? Like Cesar... or his friend Stevie. 
 You don't know anything about Cesar's finger, do you, Trevor? 
 Sometimes a person just runs out of bad choices. Then he's gotta pay a price. What happened to Cesar was inevitable. 
 You're scaring me. 
 We make choices in life and we live by 'em. You and I chose to be teachers, to stand on principle. Benny and Cesar, they're takers. They want what they want, and they want it now. 
 Trevor... 
 (unravelling) I'm sorry but everyone can't always get what they want. Sometimes you gotta take responsibility for your actions. Have you ever been ready to die for a fundamental principle? They haven't. You think those punks would die protecting your Civil Rights? 
 Trevor, don't. 
 Did you know Cesar hits his mother? Steals money from her purse? Did you know that? 
 Did you know he was here that night? In the alley? 
 (confused) What are you talking about? 
 Cesar. Jack was provoked.     It wasn't an accident, Ellen.    Cesar killed him. 
 (momentous deliberation) Where'd you get the rosary beads? 
 (pause and...) I like you, Ellen. I like you so much. Do you believe that? 
 (riveted) Yes. 
 ... I don't know you. 
 (plaintively) ... You do know me. I'm a teacher, just like you. 
 
 (to the kid with cigarettes) ... Don't you know it's not polite to point at people. Everytime you point a finger at someone else... (demonstrates) ... There's three fingers pointing back at you. (lesson over) Lemme have a cigarette. 
 Eh, Mr. G? 
 (boldly) I'm talkin' ta you, Garfield. (beat) Know what you did to Cesar. (wild notion) ... I'm thinkin' maybe you did Benny, too. (incredulously) That possible? You crush my friend's skull? Fuck 'im up wit' a two-by-four, maybe a baseball bat? 
 (trying to maintain) Please, step out of the way. 
 ... You kill my friend?   Huh? 
 School girl bitch! 
 (shaken) You gotta problem?! 
 Yer fuckin' maestro, 'at's my problem! 
 I don't know what yer talkin' 'bout! 
 Garfield killed Benny! 
 Yer crazy. 
 Don't turn yer back on me when I'm talkin' t'you, bitch. You think yer better than everybody else. Well you ain't! You ain't nuthin' but a whore! 
 Fuck you, asshole! 
 What? You forget about the time in the bungalows? We all had our turn wit you, man! 
 Shut up! 
 (gets in her face) What the fuck you been fuckin' a nigger for? Huh? You think he's gonna protec' you? Stop me from doin' whatever I want wit' you? Stop any of us from doin' what we want wit' you?! 
 Fuck you, Cesar. 
 No, fuck you! 
 Garfield better watch his back! 
 ... I wanna know if this boy was killed and whether it was gang- related. 
 (playing to crowd now) As a mother and a taxpayer, I have a right to know. And if it was gang-related then I want tighter security... 
 MR. GARCIA The death... (too noisy) The death of Benito Chacon is not gang-related. (MORE) 
 (shouting out) Who says? How can you be so sure? You're talking about my kid's safety. 
 MRS. FORD Please, everyone just calm down. 
 MR. GARCIA Thank you, Mrs. Ford. (now) ... The police at this point aren't even sure if it's a case of murder. The reason we're having this meeting tonight is to quash all the rumors floating around out there. Okay. Here's what we do know. Benny Chacon ultimately died from a drug overdose, technically it was morphine. (volume rising again) Which is what heroin breaks down into... 
 (O.S.) ... Dat's bullshit! Benny was no junkie! I know who did it! 
 It's not the gangbangers y'gotta worry about. It's the teachers! 
 MR. GARCIA That's exactly the type of rumor we don't need, Mr. Littleton. 
 ... It was Garfield. 
 MR. GARCIA (losing his patience) Say one more word and you're suspended. 
 MRS. FORD ... Sit down, Stevie. 
 (ranting) You're a fuckin' murderer, Garfield! 
 MR. GARCIA (calling for assistance) Victor? 
 ... Maybe I can't prove it but I know he did it. He fucked up Cesar and he killed Benny. (to crowd) Ast 'im! 
 Touch me and I'll sue yer ass! (as Victor backs off; now to Trevor) Yer dead, G! Yer a dead man! 
 Garfield, wait up... 
 ... Don't let that Littleton punk get to you. 
 Lil' bastard's a tweaker. He's a speed freak. You didn't know that? 
 (testing his patience) What is it, Dave? How can I help you? 
 How 'bout a ride? (taking a step back) ... The wife wouldn't let me drive my own car. Ain't that a bitch? 
 (with resignation) ... You smell like beer. 
 I only had two. That's all. Swear ta Christ. 
 I live right up here off Chandler. I'll buy you a drink. 
 ... I had the same situation 'round the time of that 'Night Stalker' thing. Remember that? Whole city was scared shitless. My wife was convinced the frickin' mailman was the 'Stalker' for about a week there. (a tubercular chuckle) Some mental giant in my 4th period starts this rumor, see. Childress is the 'Night Stalker.' Right? (chug-a-lugs) ... Idiots. Even after they caught that Ramirez jerk, I'd still hear those fucks '... They got the wrong guy. Childress is the Stalker, ese.' 
 (excusing himself) I better get goin'. Thanks for the soda. 
 Wait, wait. Hold your horses. Just hold on... 
 (a twisted grin) ... Can't leave without meetin' the kids. 
 Ta-dah... Huh? 
 ... This one's from Czechoslovakia. It's a C-Z .22 automatic. Ten round clip. Glow- in-the-dark sights. (eyeing the sights) Ain't that a beauty? (next) ... Then we gotta custom Smitty, 9 'milli.' With extended grip. These Smith & Wessons kick like a mutha. (and next) Now this one's special. A Glock 21. Lightest gun in the world. The barrel and firing pin are metal. See. Everything else on it's plastic. (handing it to Trevor) Here, feel that. 
 ... 'Course you can never be too prepared. My pukey lil' Davis .380. 
 (a severe squint) You wear that thing at school? 
 (a smirk) ... Don't worry. They never use metal detectors on teachers. (beat) I also keep a .357 inside my desk. (MORE) 
 CHILDRESS (CONT'D) (a wry grin) ... But you already know that. Didn't think I was payin' attention, did'ja? Shoulda seen the look on your face. 
 Now, Jose, if I've told you once I've told you a hundred times, stay in your cotton pickin' seat. (aiming gun) Boom! 
 Haven't you ever just wanted to blow one of these little bastards away? 
 (digressing) ... Speaking of blowing, you ever wanna fuck a high school girl, Garfield? (off no response) 'Caught yer girl, Rita, bustin' a train out in the 'utility' shed couple months back. Swear to God. She had at least five or six cholos lined up back there. (as Trevor's eyes narrow) Face it, brother, she's a slut. C'mon, I know you had 'er. (bragging now) I even did her. 
 You're drunk. 
 I know you been laughin' at me behind my back. (MORE) 
 CHILDRESS (CONT'D) I'm talkin' about screwin' high school broads and you're givin' off this self-righteous attitude like your shit don't stink. 
 ... Tell me the truth now, Garfield. Did yuh do it? C'mon, I won't tell. Did yuh whack Benny? Whadda 'bout Cesar? That was generous, only taking his finger. I woulda cut off his balls. 
 ... Go to hell, Dave. 
 (almost exulted) You really did it. You son of a bitch. 
 (disgusted) You probably think you and me are alike. 
 
 (BEFORE SCHOOL) 
 
 
 TREVOR'S POV 
 Be nice to your brother, Antonio. Don't make me go get Mommie. 
 (setting Maricella down) Go play wit' your brothers. 
 (almost defensive) Whatcha doin' here, maestro? 
 (with fervor) I want you to come back to school, Rita. You can't afford to miss finals. They won't let you graduate. 
 (overlapping) No way. Forget it. I can't. What's wrong wit' you. 
 (beseeching her) Cesar and Stevie won't bother you. That's a promise. 
 (struggles with it) Why'd they have to kill Snowball? 
 ... They didn't. 
 (on the verge of tears now) What's it fuckin' matter?! 'At school shit's for other kids, not me! 
 That's not true. You're so smart, Rita. Don't you know that? You have an opportunity here to change your life. Please don't throw away everything we've worked for. 
 I know what happened with Childress. 
 (knitting her eyebrows) What? 
 (beat) He won't ever touch you again. 
 (protesting too much) He ain't done nuthin' tuh me. That boy's fulla shit. What's he been sayin'? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 He ain't never touched me no ways. What's he sayin'? He say he fucked me?! He say dat?! (off Trevor's look) He's a damn liar! (erupting again; tears streaming down her face) Get the fuck outta here! I don't need yer damn pity and I don't need you! 
 (genuinely) But I need you, Rita. 
 (hardening) You made a mistake.    Dat's all. 
 MR. GARCIA See these? 
 MR. GARCIA They're phone calls about you. Good ones. (MORE) 
 MR. GARCIA (beat) As much as I'd like to have you stay until the end of the year, I can't overlook the seriousness of certain accusations. 
 MR. GARCIA (for example) ... Is it true you had meetings with a female student at your house? 
 I was trying to help her. 
 MR. GARCIA The implications are still there, Mr. Garfield. I can't afford to open the door for another lawsuit. Sure you can appreciate my position. (pause) You can stay until Friday. I hope that will be sufficient. 
 You're not being an alarmist. (minimizing her concerns) He gets a little overzealous at times... like some other people I know. (beat) I don't think the rosary adds up to much either, frankly. 
 Why? 
 It's probably his. (beat) Look, when I received my first Holy Communion all the boys got black rosaries and the girls got white. Trust me, there must be millions of black rosaries filed away in desk drawers from here to the Vatican. 
 This guy's been through a lot, Ellen. The system failed him. I don't think any of us can really appreciate what he's been through. (beat) I say we give the man a break. 
 
 (stilted) ... I'd like to apologize for the other night. 
 Shouldn't listen to me.    I was half asleep. 
 We really need to talk. 
 ... Not tonight. Have to finish some work... 
 Tomorrow then?     It's important to me. 
 (far off now) ... Okay. 
 (resolves it in her head) ... How 'bout seven o'clock? 
 
 Where'd you jack 'dis car from, homes? (referring to doll) 'At's nasty, man. 
 (O.S.) Ellen? 
 ... It's alright, mother. 
 
 ... Okay, let's smoke this bitch. 
 I'm in here, Cesar. 
 Dont' move, mutha fucka! 
 You killed Benny. And you cut off my finger... Say it. 
 Yeah.   I did. 
 Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man. 
 Lemme do 'im. 
 No.   This nigga's mine.

 Fuck dis shit!     Leave it! 
 I got one chance in six. I'm 'onna beat 'dis bitch... For honor, vato. 
 No!! 
 Cesar?... Why'd he do it?      Why? 
 (V.O.) ... Last night tragedy struck in North Hollywood where a high school teacher and one of his students were both found shot to death inside the teacher's home. 
 (V.O.) ... The teacher has been identified as forty-one-year-old Trevor Garfield, formerly of New York City. Most recently he taught science at John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley... (beat) Confidential sources reveal that the teacher had publicly been accused of foul play in the death of another student whose body was discovered just last month in the L.A. River... 
 ... The title of my essay is, 'Mi Vida Loca'... 'My Crazy Life'... 
 (turning to Quinn) Ms. Quinn, can I say somethin'? (correcting herself) ... May I say something? 
 ... There's been a lotta talk las' couple weeks whether Mr. Garfield done those things they been writin' about in the newspaper. He once tol' me you can't blame everything on yer environment. (beat) But I t'ink you can push a good teacher too far and he might jus' go bad like anybody else... 
 (V.O.) ... I dunno if Mr. 'G' did all those bad things. All I know is dat teachers don't get no respect. 'At's the simple truth. And if Mr. 'G' is responsible, well den he ain't the only one responsible... 
 ... We're all responsible. You and me... all of us. I'm up here today cuz a him. He was dere for me when nobody else was. Thing is... I shoulda been 'dere for him too... but I wasn't. I turned my back on the only person who ever cared about me. (pause) He said if I could stand up here and read my essay it would be a Pyrrhic victory. (beat) I ast' 'im, 'What's up wit' dat?' 
 He told me in my case it was irony... and to go look it up... so I did. (beat) I wonder now if Mr. 'G' was really talking 'bout hisself. (beat) It refers to this guy named Pyrrhus. He was a king back 'round 300 B.C. 
 
 (V.O.) (verbatim now) ... Pyrrhus defeated the Romans on two occasions. But those two victories lost him a large part of his army. Now whenever people say something's a Pyrrhic victory they mean it's a victory gained at too great a cost.

 Breathe. 
 (V.O) We should never forget how young they were. 
 SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D) My father, Stephan Gold, was the youngest Unit Commander in Mossad. 
 SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D) David Peretz had his twenty-ninth birthday while on the mission. 
 SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D) My mother was even younger. Only twenty-five. 
'S P.O.V 
 SARAH (V.O.) (CONT'D) Despite their youth they'd had the courage to confront an unimaginable evil.... 
 (O.S) ...a man whose sadistic experiments left thousands disfigured or dead, who became known by a name which defiles the annals of medicine: The Surgeon of Birkenau. 
 
 Their mission had been to return him to Israel to stand trial. Instead it ended with his death on the streets of East Berlin... 
 (V.O.) But this was not what was celebrated. It was their youth itself that became a symbol. Here were the children who had faced Israel's greatest nightmare, her greatest pain... David and Stephan have moved out of shot and Rachel reaches the DIGNITARIES. Still looking down, she manages a smile, a bob of her head, reaches out to shake the first hand... 
 (O.S.) ...and in the simple act of facing the Monster, had helped to vanquish it. 
 SARAH (O.S.) (CONT'D) This book is dedicated to my inspiration. My mother, Rachel Singer. 
 SARAH (CONT'D) Mother, I'm so very proud to be your daughter. 
 David Peretz? 
 Yes. 
 You were expecting me? 
 Yes. I was expecting you. 
 Would you come with me sir? 
 Let's go. 
 - 
 (Indistinctly) Sorry. 
 What, sir? 
 (Beat) I - I think I... 
 When are you going to stop? 
 Stop what? 
 The smoking. 
 Soon. 
 I hope so. Do it for your grandson. 
 Are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow? 
 It's all arranged, I'm afraid... 
 But we'll have breakfast before you go? I thought maybe we could take a walk on the beach? (Trying to sound casual) I'd like you to see more of him. 
 (To Sarah, ill-at-ease) Well, I'll be back. We can...maybe in the holidays or... 
 I've marked the place. I thought perhaps from chapter eleven...? 
 ...Yes, thank you. 
 If you'd rather read something else, mother..... 
 No, that's fine. 
 You must be very proud. 
 (A little automatic) ...It's a wonderful achievement. I'm very proud of her. 
 And I'm sure you were invaluable in the research. 
 (Keeping it light) Actually, my mother withstood all interrogation. My father was the talker. (Trying a joke) I'm the only journalist in Israel she won't speak to. 
 I thought he couldn't come. 
 (Standing up, surprised) So did I. 
 (To the politicos) Please, sit, sit. My God, it must be election season. 
 You came. 
 I came. So you're the famous author I've heard so much about? 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) (Without looking) Rachel. 
 Stephan. 
 (To Sarah) Now you're the expert, maybe you could tell me something. (Pointing to himself) Who's this handsome devil on the cover? 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) It went well? 
 SARAH'S HUSBAND She was wonderful. 
 That's good. Good, good. That's very good. 
 I just want thank you all for coming to help us celebrate the launch of this wonderful book. I'm sure we're all particularly thrilled to have two of the heroes of this story at the table. And even more thrilled that one of them has agreed to read for us... 
 (reading) "On the evening of the 31st of December, it began to rain more heavily. So isolated had they become from the outside world that it was only when she looked out of the window that Rachel remembered it was New Year's Eve... 
'S P.O.V 
 (Of the driver) He's driving too fast. 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) This is ridiculous. What's so important? Tell me where we're going? 
 We're going to David's apartment. 
 David...? 
 I keep track of people Rachel. It's my job. (Beat) I know he came to see you yesterday. 
 (contemptuous) What's this? The jealous ex- husband or the intelligence officer? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    14. 
 A little of both. What did he want? 
 Fuck you. 
 What did he tell you? 
 He didn't tell me anything. (Off his look) He didn't! He told me where he'd been travelling, that he'd been teaching... We spoke for a few minutes and then I had to go. 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) (Bristling) If you don't believe me ask him yourself. 
 Why did he do it? 
 
 My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport. 
 
 
. The passport is slid back across the counter and we find ourselves in... 
'S P.O.V 
 (In German) How was your trip? 
 (German) Fine. Everyone sends their love. 
 You've cut your hair. 
 
 I'm David. 
 Rachel. 
 Where do I sleep? 
 You're in my room. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) I'm moving in with him. (Beat) You're at the end there. 
 What do you think of your new wife? 
 Too young. 
 Pretty. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) You didn't notice. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) You know what I've noticed? You don't notice women. I've noticed that. How long have I known you? 
 (examining the steel) I don't know. 
 Two years. All the places we've been to. You don't look at women. Before I get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell me? 
 Well, well...I think he just noticed. 
 Yes? 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) Now an attack from behind. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) Where have you come from? 
 Argentina. 
 Really? Whereabouts? 
 Cordoba. 
 What were you doing there? 
 My husband is an Industrial Chemist. 
 He does look like a chemist. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) She's not going to fucking break, David. Move. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) What were you doing before this? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   22. 
 Before Argentina we lived in Hungary where my husband studied... 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) Oh...Liaison. 
 And what did you do in Liaison? 
 (Beat) Translator. 
 So, first time in the field. Rachel feels herself blush a little angrily. Stephan grabs her from behind and Rachel executes a perfect break, twisting Stephen's arm. Stephan winces, surprised. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) Good. That's...good. 
 Welcome to Metsada. 
 (In German) I'll be waiting for you. 
 (her throat is tight) I won't...be long. 
 Frau Roget? 
 Good morning, Frau Roget. I'm Doctor Bernhardt. 
 Good morning, doctor. 
 Alright now, just relax. We're going to do a little examination. If you feel at all uncomfortable, you just say. Alright? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   25. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Alright, this is my hand... and this is the speculum. It's going to feel cold. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Can I ask how old you are? 
 Twenty five. 
 And how long have you and your husband been trying for a baby? 
 Nearly two years. 
 Uhuh. Well, the ovaries look fine. Alright, let's see... your cervix is slightly retroverted. Tilted backwards? 
 Really? The angle from which we next see VOGEL, and the way the image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE. 
 Mmm. But that generally shouldn't affect fertility. 
 Oh, good. 
 You have a slight accent, Frau Roget. Where are you from? 
 Argentina. We just moved here... A few months ago. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    26. 
 Whereabouts in Argentina? Buenos Aires? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Oh, Buenos Aires. Beautiful. I went once, when I was young. We went to the Opera house I remember. What's it called again? 
 Teatro Colon. He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile. 
 That's right. Beautiful. This might sting a little, dear. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. Now, there's a couple of tests we need to run, make sure there are no problems. Is that alright? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Brave girl. 
 (in German) So. Everything...? 
 (in German, abruptly) Next appointment is on Wednesday. 
 Bitte sehr. 
 One, two, three, four, five, six... 
 (O.S.) It's a ghost station... 
 West Berlin trains pass through East Berlin on this track, but don't stop. 
 Usually. 
 (V.O.) The station's guarded at all times... 
 ...and the stairs to the platform are sealed off. 
 (V.O.) Our train driver makes an unscheduled stop on the near track. 
 (V.O.) The last two carriages will be around... 
 ...here. And they will be empty. Once that train has stopped, the guards won't be able to see this fence. And on the other side of the fence is... 
 (V.O.) ...a postal depot. 
 (V.O.) The vans come and go all day long. 
 We're just one more parcel. Once we're in West Berlin there'll be transport to Templehof airbase and a private charter. 
 That's the wrapping. Now all we need is the present. Rachel realises both men are looking at her. 
 Try this on. 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) (re: the coat) How does it feel? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   31. 
 (Flirting) Nice. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) Here you are, Mossad agent, all those years of training, the highest levels of marksmanship and krav magah, first big mission...sewing. 
 Black belt in dressmaking. 
 I never argue with an armed woman. 
 (Politely) What is it? 
 (Beat) It doesn't have a name. 
 (Grimacing) Shit. 
 (Solemn) Now it does. 
 DAVID (CONT'D) It's my birthday. 
 Uh, at ten - study the Mishnah, at fifteen - study the Talmud. By eighteen - stand under the wedding canopy... 
 We're too late for all of those. 
 Uh...twenty. In your twenties you are to "pursue your life's goals." 
 (Flirtatious) What are you pursuing Rachel? Rachel thinks about it, shrugs. 
 I don't know. I'm waiting to find out. 
 (smiles to himself) Youth... 
 What about you, grandfather? Have you got a goal? 
 (Smiling) Oh yes. We believe in goals in my family. We're very driven men. My father was Director of Collections by the time he was fifty. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   33. 
 So what's your goal? 
 Director of Collections by forty. 
 (To David) What about you David. What "life goal" are you pursuing? 
 This is it. 
 This is it? This is all you want? 
 Seriously, what do you want out of life? 
 (Beat, shrugs) I want this. I want to get Vogel. I want him to be put on trial and I want the world to watch so everyone knows what he did. I want them all to know the truth. 
 And...I want another drink. 
 Forget about it. 
 Forget about what? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   34. 
 I've spent two years with him, and I don't know him. Nobody knows him. He's alone. 
 What about family? 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) All of them? 
 (O.S.) All of them. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) Maybe it's not always a blessing to survive. 
 Vielen dank! 
. 
 This is my hand. This is the speculum. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   35. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) How did you find me? 
 (beat) What? 
 Who told you about me? 
 Who... told us? 
 Were you referred by a doctor, or...? 
 (trying to conceal her relief) Oh, Doctor Eisenberg. 
 Ah-ha. How is the old Jew? 
 Very good. 
 Any history of infertility in your family Frau Roget? 
 No. 
 Are your periods irregular? 
 Yes. 
 Yes. I think we've found the problem. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) It's very common. Your ovarian follicles...well, inside you're still immature. (MORE) FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   36. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) We need to help you with this. There's something we can use, a little injection. Do you want to proceed? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) (As he works) How many brothers and sisters do you have? 
 (Stiff) None. 
 An only child? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) And yet you say there's no family history of fertility problems? 
 (Beat) I lost my mother in the war. 
 Are you alright? 
 Identity is confirmed. We have a green light. 
 It's a brave thing you're doing. 
 I'm not brave. I'm terrified. 
 But you're doing it anyway. Because you know how important it is. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    38. 
 You're very brave. 
 (Beat) David... 
 It's whiskey. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) You're so beautiful... 
 Alright, this is my hand. And this is the speculum. 
 Okay. 
. 
 You had intercourse last night? 
 (Tight) Yes. 
 Good. You're at the most fertile stage of your cycle. This is very good timing. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) I think we are going to see results. (MORE) FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    40. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) All you have to do is have faith. Ask any of my patients. 
 What about your patients in Birkenau...? 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) Help! 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) He collapsed! 
 My God! What happened?! 
 (overlapping) I don't know! I don't know! He just clutched his chest and collapsed! 
 (into the phone) I need an ambulance! Karl-Gustav- Strasse. The clinic. My husband has had a heart attack. 
 (O.S.) (Over phone) Your name please? 
 It's Frau Bernhardt, please, please hurry! 
 (O.S.) (Over phones) The ambulance is already on the way, madam. 
 (to no one in particular) Oh god! Come on, come on! Hurry! 
 They're here. Stay with him. I'll go and get them... 
 We need to take him to the hospital. He and David open up the stretcher and transfer Vogel to it with some efficiency. 
 Oh God! 
 He's going to be alright. 
 I'm sorry, Madam, but you'll need to meet us at the hospital. 
 But... I want to travel with him. 
 Not possible I'm afraid. New regulations. 
 Don't worry, he's in good hands now. He's going to be fine. 
 Thank you...thank you. 
 You should get your things, go to the hospital to meet him. 
 (Tense) I know, I know. 
 
. 
 (Softly) One, two, three, four, five, six... 
 (As he runs) Twenty, twenty one, twenty two... 
 (O.S.) (calling) Do you have a light? 
 You new? 
 First shift. The girls said it was okay to come out for a smoke.... 
 Yeah, it's okay. Are you working until midnight? 
 Yes. 
 After the late shift most of us go to the Vetter. Do you know it? 
 ...it's just on the corner. You should come along. 
 There's something on the tracks up here! 
 Well, maybe I'll see you there? I finish in half an hour. Why don't you go and get me a drink ready? 
 Half an hour then. 
 What was that...? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   50. 
 (Softly) Fuck. 
 I think it came from over here? 
 No, it was one of those... 
 (O.S.) Stay where you are! 
 There's nothing there. Get moving now! 
 What are you doing here? 
 I work here. I'm on a break. 
 Show me your papers, both of you. 
 (hissing) We have to go! 
 We can make it. Help me with him... 
 (Handing them back) You can go. 
 (Hissing) We're going! Now! FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   52. 
 Not without her. 
 (Startled) Hey! Over here! 
 
 P.O.V - 
 Down! 
'S P.O.V 
 Is he dead? (Beat) Is he dead? 
 Who? 
 The Guard! The one who saw your face! Is he dead? 
 No. 
 How did he come round? How the fuck did he come round? You gave him the full injection? 
 Did you give him the... 
 I don't know! I thought I... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   55. 
 Jesus Christ! 
 We could have gone! 
 It's not over. 
 We could have fucking...! 
 WE STILL HAVE HIM! IT'S NOT OVER! We still have him. 
'S P.O.V 
 (Standing up) What did he say? 
 You made contact? 
 What did he say? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   56. 
 It's going to take time. They need to open up a new route, they need to find political help. Maybe the Americans. Two weeks... maybe three. 
 We work four shifts guarding him. We feed him at the end of each shift. We never leave him alone. 
 (turns to Rachel, hard) And you're compromised. You don't leave the fucking house. 
 We can do this. We just need to stay focussed. 
 (In German) .....Fucking assholes! Fucking pig shit food! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck... 
 
 (Off her look) At this rate he's going to starve himself to death before we can get him back. 
 My wife. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Is she hurt? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Is she alright? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Please? Tell me she's alright. 
 You can't talk to him. 
 I didn't say anything. 
 You can't listen to him. 
 I know. I just... 
 (overlapping) I'm not angry - 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) - I'm just telling you - we don't talk to him. We don't listen to him. He isn't there. He isn't a human being. He... 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) We have a date. Ten days time. The Americans are going to help. 
 Good. 
 
 Fuck! 
 Why don't you just kill me now? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) How can you keep me waiting to die like this! 
 I know what you want. You want to hand me over to the others, let there be some fucking sham of a trial. Then, when they kill me, you can tell yourself that there was no blood on your hands. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) But that isn't true. There will be blood on your hands. (MORE) FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    61. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) You will be my murderer! You fucking hypocrite. You fucking... 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) (Softly) Yes. Do it. You want to do it... 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) That's right. I'd forgotten. You Jews never knew how to kill. Only how to die. 
 I was dreaming about my wife. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) One of the great regrets of my life is that we were unable to have children. My wife would have made a wonderful mother. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) It's a great blessing. Rachel stares at him. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) You should try lemons. For the morning sickness. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) They say it helps. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) What's your name? (Beat) Sarah? Hannah?...Rachel? Esther? (Beat) You Jews stay close to your roots, don't you? It's a good thing. Very good. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   63. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) I loved the bible as a child. Retribution. Higher justice. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Yes. I understand you perfectly. (Beat) You weren't lying at the clinic when you told me about your mother were you? About her death? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) I'm very sorry for your loss. It almost takes her breath away. She tears the tape and puts it over his mouth, gets up and walks away, determined not to show him any emotion. 
 What happened? What's the matter? 
 Nothing. He...nothing. 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) He can understand us. 
 What? 
 He can understand every word we're saying. He just spoke to me. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   64. 
 It's alright. It's alright. It's nearly over. 
 (Suddenly) Why didn't you go? At the station. You could have got away. Why didn't you? 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) What did they say? 
 Stephan? 
 It's not happening. 
 What the fuck does that mean? 
 The Americans have pulled out. (To Rachel) Has he been fed? 
 So...so what does that mean? 
 Oh God... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   65. 
 Did you feed him? 
 What does that mean? What's the plan now? 
 (rising panic) We just need to get him to the airfield, there must be some other way, some... 
 I said has he...? 
 (overlapping) I'm asking you... 
 (overlapping) I'm talking to her! Supposedly it's her shift now, but instead of doing what she's supposed to be doing she's out here with you! (To Rachel) Now answer the fucking question: Did you feed him? 
 YES! I fed him! 
 (Beat) There's no plan. There's no fucking plan. They said the operation is being "re- evaluated." 
 You know what that means? They're going to cut us loose. 
 It's a fucking mess and they're backing away from it quickly as they can. 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) (Beat) No. 
 It's happening. I can feel it. 
 They can't just leave us! 
 Yes they can! Because we fucked it all up! We fucked it all up and now we're on our own! 
 Were you followed? 
 DAVID (CONT'D) Could you have been...? 
 Stephan? Stephan is hurriedly screwing the SILENCER onto the GUN. There's another KNOCK at the door. 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) Stephan! 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
 If it's them, he dies. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) Move. 
 You're not doing this. 
 He's not getting away from me. 
 This isn't the mission. 
 I decide what the mission is! If I say he dies, he dies. 
 We're finishing this mission. We're taking him back. 
 Get out of the way! 
 Rachel. Rachel! 
 (Dully) It was the lady from the bottom apartment. She invited us to her New Year's Eve party. 
 What are you doing? 
 It's your shift. 
 (To Rachel) Did you know about this? 
 About what? 
 (To Stephan) His mouth's taped. You want him to suffocate? 
 I was sick of seeing his face. Go back in. 
 Don't do that again. 
 You don't give orders David. It's your shift now so you can go back in there... 
 Stop it! 
 We're not animals. Just remember what we are. Remember what we're not. 
 What are you doing? 
 I have to get out. 
 (Gently) Rachel... 
 Get out of my way, please. I'm just going to go out for a few minutes. That's all I want to do. 
 She wants to go out. 
 (appealing) No one will see me. Tell him, David. I just want to walk. I just want to get some...air. Please. 
 Don't be stupid. 
 GET OFF ME! 
 Thank you. David. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) David and Stephan and Rachel... 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) If I had a choice I'd prefer Rachel to feed me. So gentle...in another life, the makings of a Nurse, I think...in another life... 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) How is she today? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   72. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) You should let her get more rest. It's a dangerous time, the first month or two of the pregnancy. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) (Beat) You didn't know? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) You're not the father then? (Beat)I thought it would be you. I thought...I don't know. The way you look at her. The way she looks at you... 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Women can be like that, they like to make you dance first, I remember. (As though to himself) So, she chose the other one...? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) That must be hard, watching them together, right in front of you. And you not saying a word. Like the Poet says - "Great souls suffer in silence." I wouldn't have taken Stephan as a family man. Too ambitious, too...? Whereas you? David, I see you with children... 
 (Quietly) Shut up. 
 I am expressing my sympathy. For your suffering. 
 What does a monster like you know about suffering? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   73. 
 I'm a doctor, David. 
 A doctor. (beat)You blind children trying to change the colour of their eyes. You inject people with petrol. You...you replace people's hands and legs and you watch as they... 
 DAVID (CONT'D) This isn't medicine. This is disease. This is sickness. 
 So we were all insane? Is that the answer? 
 (Beat) There's no answer. I'm not looking for an answer. I'm not looking for... 
 You're trembling. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) It's strange. Here I am - the victim, kidnapped, bound, soon to be murdered, but I think you are the one that is afraid, David. (Beat) Afraid of the monster. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) (Softly) Boo. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Yes. Do you know why it was easy to exterminate you people? Your weakness. I saw it. Every day I saw it. Every one of them, thinking only of how to avoid being flogged, or kicked, or killed. Only thinking of themselves. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Why do you think it only took four soldiers to lead a thousand people to the gas chambers? Entire families? Because not one, out of thousands, had the courage to resist, the courage to be the first to fall. Not one would sacrifice himself. Even when we took their children from them. I knew then that you people had no right to live, no right to... 
 Out. We're going out. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   75. 
. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) (to Rachel) Are you going to be alright? 
 (Mumbling, in German) Thank you... 
 
 Nothing. Not a trace. Nothing at all. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   78. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) He might go to the house, might try and get a message to the wife... 
 (Without looking up) He's not going back to the house. He's gone. Fifteen years, it took them to find him. And he's gone. And no-one's going to find him again. 
 So we what? We...are you going to make the phone call? Are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl? Wonderful. But don't try and take me down with you. I've done nothing wrong. Remember that! 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) (muttering tensely) This can't happen! This is never going to go away. 
 I take responsibility. It was my shift. 
 (Quietly) This happened because of me. I let him go. And no-one's ever going to find him again. 
 No-one's ever going to find him again. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) (Beat) What if he didn't escape? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   79. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Only four people know what happened in this room. Us, and him. And he's not talking. No one will ever hear from him again. 
 (Realizing what he means) No. 
 Nobody needs to know what happened here. 
 He escaped. 
 That's the truth. But that doesn't have to be the truth we take home. The truth can be anything we want it to be. The truth is Vogel tried to escape, you struggled with him and got hurt. The truth is, seconds before he got away, Rachel got the gun and shot him. The truth is we got rid of him.... got rid of the body... got rid of every trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau. 
 We can't lie about this! 
 No, you know what? We have to. We have to! This is...this isn't about us. This is about Israel. This is a national humiliation! We can't be seen to fail. And in the end, Vogel rots away his life in some jungle, looking over his shoulder, waiting for the bullet...? Who's to say...?

 He's gone. What does it matter?(Beat) He's gone. 
 (Seizing ) He's right. It makes no difference. No difference. All we have to agree is that we never talk about this. No matter what happens, we never tell anyone. The truth stays in this room. Between us. Agreed? Rachel looks at David again, wanting some kind of sign. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) (To Rachel) Agreed? Say it. (Silence) I need to hear you say it! 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) (To Rachel) Say it. Say... 
 Agreed. Silence. Rachel closes her eyes. Instead of relief she feels a kind of immense disappointment. 
 David...? 
 Rachel? Say it. It's an oath. Say it.

 (crying out) How could this happen? You said he would never speak! You said he'd never... 
 We don't know it's him. 
 Oh God! Oh God! 
 If you read it... 
 He's alive! He's in the Ukraine! What else is there to read? 
 This is a little internet story. (Grabbing the paper, reading)..."a psychiatric patient claiming to be the Surgeon of Birkenau..." Some crazy old man. No-one is paying this any attention. Yet. 
 (as if her mind was elsewhere) How did you find it? 
 David comes back after all this time, I want to know why. I had his apartment searched. This was on his computer... 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) He didn't say anything to you last night..? 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) Rachel..? 
 No! 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) (quietly) Why would he do this..? 
 Because he couldn't handle it. I told him we had to deal with it and he couldn't handle it. He thought it was all going to come out and he panicked... 
 (Suddenly) Deal with it? (Beat) What does that mean? Deal with it? 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) What did you tell him to do? 
 (Simply) I told him to find Vogel. I told him to finish it. 
 (quiet rage) Did you know he'd been ill? Did you...? You knew, didn't you? You killed him. YOU killed him! You knew he wasn't strong enough... 
 (overlapping) FUCK DAVID! I don't want to hear about David! David took the coward's way out! 
 You could have left it alone! It's an old man in a hospital! You said - nobody will believe it! No-one will notice! 
 There's a journalist. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) A Ukrainian. He's heard about it and he's going to interview Vogel. (Beat) Then it all comes apart. (Beat) We don't have the name of the hospital. You have to find out where he is. 
 What are you talking about? 
 David's taken himself out of the equation. (Indicating his chair) I can't do it. You're the only one left. 
 Are you insane? 
 We can't... 
 I'm not...Look at me! I'm not capable of...This is insane. I can't do this. 
 (Beat. Simply) You have to, Rachel. Because for thirty years you've been taking the credit for it. (Beat, carefully) And there's Sarah. It's as if he's struck her. Beat. 
 I won't do this. 
 (Beat) I always knew this would happen. I knew we'd be punished. I knew we'd have to pay. 
 (Quietly) I thought I'd already been punished. 
 God doesn't plant car bombs. 
 I wasn't referring to the wheelchair.

 STEPHAN (CONT'D) But there's one thing I would never change. 
 (Instantly) She isn't going to find out. 
 RACHEL (CONT'D) She can never find out. 
 My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) Go down to her. Say goodbye to her. 
 How can I? (Beat.) How can I? 
 (turning to the Kiosk Owner) Cigarettes please. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   87. 
 (In Russian) What can I get you? 
 Just a coffee. 
 At that moment, I don't think I was thinking about myself at all. I was thinking about my mother. I was thinking about how she had suffered in Europe. The FACES of the soldiers, moved by this. One raises a hand. 
 The same question to Mr. Peretz. 
 (Calmly) Fuck him. 
 Fuck him. 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) Hurry up. Rachel finishes her glass, starts to apply some eye makeup. She senses something and turns to find YOUNG SARAH (four) watching her from the doorway. She stares back at her dully. 
 Go to bed, Sarah.

 When is he supposed to interview him? 
 Tomorrow. There's silence from the other end. Both know what this means. 
 (O.S.) This will be over soon. And when it is... 
 (O.S.) What were you thinking at that moment? 
 Did you think you were going to die? 
 I'll tell you something. At that moment, when I was on the floor, I wasn't thinking about myself at all. I was thinking about my mother. And what she had suffered in Europe. I think that was what gave me the strength to get up again.

 (Russian) Good morning. I'm here to visit Mr. Schevchuk? The man squints at her, checks his register an squints at her again. 
 You're from the newspaper? Because I have a man's name here... 
 Oh, no, no. I'm Mr Schevchuk's niece. Anna Barova. I've been before, do you remember? 
 Well, our visiting hours haven't changed, I'm afraid. Eleven till one. 
 REGISTRAR (CONT'D) Take a seat? 
 
 Mr. Schevchuk is in room 414. Visiting time starts at eleven o'clock. You can take a seat over there. 
. 
 (Weakly) Are you the journalist? (Beat) Do you know who I am? 
 (Beat, meaning it) No. No, I don't. 
 My name is Dieter Vogel. I am the Surgeon of Birkenau. (Beat) Have you heard of me? 
 Yes. I've heard of you. 
 (Simply) I have killed thousands. You can take my photograph. The last photograph of the Surgeon of Birkenau? 
 Hold the doors please. 
 (O.S.) ...It comes down to blood. We weren't afraid of power. It was our destiny. The slave races had bred with apes. But we Aryans are descendants of the Theozoa who come from another planet. We were born to rule and to... 
 (Answering) Yes? 
 (O.S.) (Beat) It isn't him. Stephan nods, a fixed smile on his face, covers the mouthpiece. 
 (gesturing to Officials) A family matter... Would you give me a moment? 
 STEPHAN (CONT'D) (Into phone) You're sure? 
 It isn't him. It's over. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   109. 
 (O.S.) Thank God. Thank God. This is wonderful. This is...and you're okay? Rachel? You're alright, yes? 
 STEPHAN (O.S.)(CONT'D) Rachel? 
 You were wrong. 
 (O.S.) Well, thank God I was, but... 
 About David. You were wrong about him. 
 About David? 
 (O.S.) He didn't kill himself because he was afraid the story would come out. 
 When he came to see me, he was asking me for something. 
 (O.S.) What? 
 My permission. And I didn't give it. I wouldn't let him tell the truth and he was tired of living with the lie. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 109A. 
 Truth is a luxury, Rachel. Some people have to put other things first - their country, their people...their children... 
 (O.S.) Sarah's so proud of you, Rachel. You have to think about her. 
 (Crying) I want her to be proud of me. 
 (O.S.) (Soothing) Of course you do. 
 I want to do something to make her proud of me. 
 Rachel...? Rachel...? 
 (O.S.) People have to know the truth, Stephan. David was right. 
 (O.S.) Listen to me... 
 Goodbye. 
 (O.S.) Rachel, listen to me...! 
 Sir....? 
 As she moves down another corridor. 
. 
 (a dull rasp) Why did you come...? 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Why did you have to come? You didn't have to follow me. 
 VOGEL (CONT'D) Was it Schevchuk? Did he talk? 
 I can stop him. I won't tell him anymore. (Almost pleading) Nobody needs to know. 
 You Jews never knew how to kill. Only how to die. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   114.

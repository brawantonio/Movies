 Ariel: Scuttle! Scuttle: (Looking through the telescope the wrong way, shouting.) Whoa! Mermaid off the port bow! Ariel, how you doin' kid? (Lowers telescope to reveal Ariel at wing's length.) Whoa, what a swim! Ariel: Scuttle - look what we found. Flounder: Yeah - we were in this sunken ship - it was really creepy. Scuttle: Human stuff, huh?  Hey, lemme see. (Picks up fork.) Look at this. Wow - this is special - this is very, very unusual. Ariel: What?  What is it? Scuttle: It's a dinglehopper! Humans use these little babies . . . to straighten their hair out. See - just a little twirl here an' a yank there and - voiolay!  You got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over! Ariel: A dinglehopper! Flounder: What about that one? Scuttle: (Holding pipe) Ah - this I haven't seen in years.  This is wonderful! A banded, bulbous - snarfblat. Ariel and Flounder: Oohhh. Scuttle: Now, the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times, when humans used to sit around, and stare at each other all day.  Got very boring.  So, they invented the snarfblat to make fine music.  Allow me. (Scuttle blows into the pipe; seaweed pops out the other end.) Ariel: Music?  Oh, the concert! Oh my gosh, my father's gonna kill me! Flounder: The concert was today? Scuttle: (Still contemplating pipe.) Maybe you could make a little planter out of it or somethin'. Ariel: Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go. Thank you Scuttle. (Waves.) Scuttle: Anytime sweetie, anytime. 
 Sebastian: Constant. Triton: Someone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble. Sebastian: All the time - Triton: And YOU are just the crab to do it. 
 Ariel: Sebastion!? Sebastian: Ariel - what, are you mad?  How could you - what is all this? Ariel: It, err, it's just my - collection. . . . Sebastian: Oh.  I see.  Your collection.  Hmmm.  IF YOUR FATHER KNEW ABOUT THIS PLACE HE'D - Flounder: You're not gonna tell him, are you? Ariel: Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand. Sebastian: Ariel.  You're under a lot of pressure down here.  Come with me, I'll take you home and get you something warm to drink. (A ship passes by overhead.) Ariel: What do you suppose?. . . Sebastion: Ariel? Ariel! 
 Sebastian: Peculiar? Triton: You know, moaning about, daydreaming, singing to herself. . . .  You haven't noticed, hmm? Sebastian: Oh - well, I - Triton: Sebastian. . . . 
 Sebastian: Hmmm? Triton: I know you've been keeping something from me. . . . Sebastian: Keeping . . . something? Triton: About Ariel? Sebastian: Ariel . . . ? Triton: In love? Sebastian: I tried to stop her, sir.  She wouldn't listen.  I told her to stay away from humans - they are bad, they are trouble, they - Triton: Humans?  WHAT ABOUT HUMANS? Sebastian: Humans?  Ho ho ho ho. . . . Who said anything about humans? 
 True? Yes 
 Ariel: (Sings.) Ursula: Keep singing! (Giant magical hands rip out Ariel's voice and give it to Ursula. She laughs as Ariel is changed into a human and rushed to the surf- ace by Flounder and Sebastion.) 
 Eric: Ariel? 
 Ariel: Eric.

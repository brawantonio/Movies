 A 
 (O.S.) Eine maus findet den kase. 
 Mien Prisoner! 
 (German accent) You will write your mother. Tell her how you will die now. 
 You will write. How you die alone. 
 (hisses) Write. 
 Enough. Now you will beg for your life. 
 (interrupts sheepishly in German accent) The protocol says we should - 
 I am the fucking protocol. (to Kelly) Beg! 
 Beg - for - your - life! 
 Silence. Now I have a little fun. 
 (sneers) There are no rules in war. 
 I shower in the blood of my victims -- 
 No wonder you smell so bad. 
 Don't shoot, please. 
 Will you look at the manners on this guy? (to German) Remember to thank me when I kill you. 
 No, really, not in the neck - 
 (to Kelly) You all right? 
 You want me to give you a minute? 
 That's right. Look on the bright side. 
 Bart. Bart Bowland. 
 Kelly? 
 I mean - that's Irish, right? 
 (from the floor, now with a decidedly American accent) Wow man, this is a really beautiful scene and all, but I have to interrupt. (to Bart) Why the fuck did you have to shoot that cap so close to my neck? You gave me a powder burn. 
 Well, what was that whole creepy death wish thing about? 
 (shrugs) Sometimes I get so caught up in the moment. 
 Inspired, wasn't it? 
 Dude, you made him write to his mother? Who are you, Dr. Phil? 
 (also with American accent) Can we get up now? 
 Might as well. There's only an hour left anyway. 
 (to Kelly) Admit it. You were scared. 
 That Willys yours? 
 Real funny, Ernswiler. You might still get your chance to die today. 
 Character building? Those crazy guys from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock. 
 D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a guy who actually injected himself with malaria. 
 Where do you live, anyway? 
 That explains the death wish. Me too. What street? 
 (chewing) Hmm, don't know it. 
 Langely Prep. 
 Well, I got kicked out of Shaker Heights High because my birdhouse came unglued in honors woodshop. 
 No matter. (raises his voice to address the room) We're all soldiers here. 
 That's right./Here, here./ Whooping, cheers, etc. 
 You should come over some time. Service our lawnmower. 
 How bourgeois. Cheerio then. 
 Sergeant Keller! How was the war? Did we win? 
 As usual, your cynicism is refreshing. 
 (lightly) You should get that checked. 
 (to Kelly) Son of Eve. You are very dirty. 
 (to Kelly) Don't touch anything. We have to get ready for the Starving Artist show. (to Xiou-Xiou) Now Nana, the gold has to be feathery, not gloppy - see? 
 Now you try. 
 (to Kelly) She loves the gold. Always overuses it. And usually her touch is so light. 
 XIOU-XIOU Gold is the color of the sun. 
 Mao, what did we say about the eyes? 
 More - empathy? 
 That's right. And didn't I tell you to put in more cacti? 
 (shakes head) No, no more cacti. Too busy. Simplicity is best. 
 Oh boy. I'm not having this battle with you again. 
 Well, you can always chip in here. We're ordering pizza later. 
 Sweetie, you know what we said about paying for the war things. Nothing's changed. 
 Don't be dramatic. 
 You're just going to have to find a way to pay for it yourself then, I guess. (to Mother Ling) No - not that way - the sky should be stormier. Angry clouds. 
 More brown, less blue. 
 Now Keller, who needs that sandwich more - you or the daughter of a crack addict trying to make a new life? 
 That went well. 
 So how'd your battle go today? I still don't understand how you could reenact the Battle of the Bulge in seventy-two degree weather. (plays with hair) Didn't all those guys freeze to death? 
 That's gross. 
 Then why do you do it? 
 Really? Maybe I should try it. 
 Stop it! 
 Sorry I asked. 
 I'll accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there. 
 The frozen food woman came in with her kids. They must eat out of those little cardboard trays every night. One of the kids looked like cardboard. 
 No. 
 Is this store open? I've been waiting up front. If the store's closed, it shouldn't have a sign that says twenty- four hours. 
 Sorry about that. 
 I have a lot of coupons and I don't want to be here when they expire. 
 What the fuck are you looking at, GI Jane? 
 No really, what makes you think you can look at me? 
 That's pretty funny. You got dental insurance? 
 Stop it. 
 What? What? 
 MR. NORMAN Whoops! 
 MR. NORMAN And here, at Gettysburg, the ranks of Union soldiers fought bravely on. They were willing to give their lives so that others might be free. 
 MR. NORMAN Is there a problem Mr. Ernswiler? 
 What gives you the idea that you can or ought to question the curriculum? 
 Or question your teacher? 
 Kelly, you're a very bright boy. But you're making some serious mistakes. 
 This anger must be masking a lot of hurt. 
 I see you're not going to college next year. What are your plans? 
 How do I get through to you? 
 I think we can come up with a punishment which might actually be more of an opportunity for you to realize your true potential. 
 You upset Bridget. 
 You need to apologize. 
 Why are you fucking with me? You little fucker. Want to play, fuckface? 
 Let's see what Beetle Bailey's got in his knapsack. 
 Kelly. Hey. 
 Just a couple days a month, to get a heads-up on the latest stuff. What are you doing? 
 Is that all? Don't bother. I have a couple extras at home. I could give you one if you want. 
 My dad's real into hoarding. 
 Grant's field flask. 
 Forget him. 
 (laughing in sympathy and amusement) What is he, some kind of sadist? 
 Jesus, she must think you're really screwed up. Are you? 
 (grabs box) Take this. That'll shut them up. 
 Stonewall Jackson's. 
 Can you imagine that? Losing your leg and getting back up on your horse? Unbelievable. What balls. 
 He's got so much crap crammed in here he doesn't even notice when it's missing. I saw a backpack in here somewhere. 
 I thought he had a couple. 
 Trust me, you shouldn't. (burps) Where'd your old one go? 
 How? 
 You let someone take it? 
 Sounds like your mouth gets you into trouble a lot. 
 Tabby, this is Kelly. 
 (to Kelly) Don't give him any money, whatever you do. 
 Shut up. 
 All these little old ladies are looking for him in Arizona. He took their retirement money and bought defective bazookas with it. 
 Very funny. We're paying attention to you, are you happy now? 
 Finally, my life is complete. Fait accompli. 
 (to Tabby) Minnie's making sloppy joes. Want one? 
 Sloppy joe? Sloppy no. 
 I have to go take a shower. Will you call me when Miner gets here? 
 The fiancé. 
 Listen, I'm going to the flea market on Saturday. I have a line on a couple dealers. You could get a backpack there. 
 Especially if you know who to talk to. 
 Hey fuckface. Like my new hat? I just joined the Boy Scouts. 
 You're a regular Howie Mandel. 
 Lance! 
 Okay babe. (to Kelly) One day you and me will be alone. And won't that be nice? 
 Why do you mess with him? 
 Oh, Kelly, you're home. Good. I need you to go to the art supply store for me. 
 He was going to but he had to go lead a meeting at Care House. 
 I'll make it up to you. 
 When are you going to give me a break? 
 You're right. You have every reason to crawl into the corner and give up. But please just get me some paints first. 
 We need burnt sienna, cadmium red, and midnight blue. Two tubes of blue. (looks at him) What happened to your face? 
 Oh, hello. What happened to you? 
 You paint? 
 How so? 
 Oh you're not one of those oil snobs are you? 
 Jejune? You're jejune. How old are you anyway? 
 And you paint? 
 That explains it. 
 Infantas are Spanish. Michelangelo was Italian. 
 Well - Kelly. Nice talking to you. 
 
 (to Kelly) That there's actual sand from Iwo Jima. 
 Or your sister's sandbox. 
 Well, it don't come with no certificate of authenticity. (considers) I could write one up for you, I suppose. Get it notarized. 
 No, that's quite all right. Actually, I'm in the market for medals. 
 Sure. I got a couple purple hearts. A Silver Star. DSC. Can't sell them to you though. They were gramp's. (wink) 
 Are you sure? 
 They have a lot of sentimental value - 
 Yeah. How much? 
 A lot. 
 What's this? 
 General Ulysses S. Grant's field flask, my friend. 
 Throw in one of those backpacks and we'll call it even. 
 Exactly. That's why the resale value is so high. 
 Don't be so naïve. We all have our skeletons. Some of them just pay more than others. 
 Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets everything right, don't they? 
 You boys look like Goldwater fans. 
 Well jeez, you don't have to be insulted. 
 Anything military? 
 Fish around in that cigar box. 
 What do you want for the box? 
 Twenty dollars. 
 Fifteen. 
 Don't be so hasty. (fanning) I got a few Geraldine Ferraro pins I'm looking to unload. 
 Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going to go to school? 
 Ah, you have that luxury. 
 (shrugs) I didn't have much say in the matter. Everything has been decided for me since birth. I'm not whining about it. Play the hand you're dealt, right? 
 Are you crazy? My life sucks. Everyone's always telling me what to do. You can't fight it. Go with the flow. 
 She got to go where she wanted. Sarah Lawrence. Six years. She's almost done with grad school. Yale. 
 (thinking) I don't know. I mean, she drives off in her car in September. For all we know, she could just pull her car over in Albany and sleep there until May. 
 It was a joke. Joke? 
 What happened to your face? 
 Same guy? 
 What are you going to do about it? 
 Of course not. But there are alternatives… 
 Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd Special Operations Wing? 
 Well do you want to get this guy or what? 
 All right. Let's get the fuck out of here, then. 
 (on the move) I have some things to show you. 
 Once we've gathered the intelligence, the plan will reveal itself. 
 No, it limits our scope - what's the objective? 
 Easy enough. 'Nam's probably our go- to war for that sort of thing. I have the declassified briefs from the Phoenix Project around here somewhere. 
 Hey. I have some stretcher bars out in the car. Can somebody help me bring them in? 
 Of course we'll drop what we're doing because what you're doing must be more important. 
 I'll find those reports. 
 That's the Cleveland waterfront. 
 It's the light. I was playing with diffusion. 
 Very funny, wiseass. 
 It is. 
 Farmer? 
 (laughs) Miner? What about him? 
 No. Definitely not. Thank god. 
 You said your mom was a painter? 
 What do you mean? 
 Like Andy Warhol's Factory. 
 Wow. So you really grew up with it. What does, did, your dad do? 
 "Tragedy struck?" 
 Well, just wait. Those burnout types always have a triumphant comeback tour. 
 Christ Kelly, I let you go out on a little supply line assist and you're gone for days. Come on. 
 Have fun, boys. 
 (to Bart) And I used to think you were the only crazy one. 
 Enough with the mind pollution, Hanoi Hannah. 
 Are you? 
 I don't think I have room for a playpen in here. 
 So, you have a thing for my sister? 
 Everybody does. 
 Oh really, like what? 
 You don't wear women's clothes when you're alone, do you? 
 Wha? 
 Keller. There's a meteor shower. 
 Oh, you mean Emmett? They didn't have an empty bed for him at Care House. 
 He just needs a place to sleep for the night. 
 I've been straight for four years, almost five. A third of your life. 
 I hate to tell you this, but I'm not your problem anymore. 
 Let me know. I can wait. 
 (to himself) Keller, there's a meteor shower. 
 
 Let me see. Don't be a farb, give them up. 
 The coast is clear. 
 Let me prepare to deploy. 
 We've planned for every contingency using the tried and true techniques of the last great world power. 
 Stay low. On my signal. 
 My dad has a gun. 
 Can I help you, young man? 
 I'm not interested. 
 Smile worker bee. I'll be your boss some day. 
 What an asshole. His mom gave me cookies, though. 
 Don't ask stupid questions. Let's go home and listen. 
 It was a five-watt FM bug, so we should be in range - 
 LANCE'S MOM (O.S.) So then I told her, "Harriet, with potato salad like that it's no wonder Ray-Ray's cheating on you." 
 (O.S.) You didn't. 
 LANCE'S MOM You're right. But I was thinking it. Instead I just told her to add more vinegar next time, and - 
 Be patient. It's voice activated, so we'll get everything. Trust me. It's going to be great. 
 We reconnoiter tomorrow at nineteen hundred hours. 
 -- And if we don't sell them there, we'll set up on the corner of Stevens and Lane, by the gas station. That's a good location. 
 Are you listening to me? 
 Did you make this with more chili pepper than usual? 
 The same as always. 
 Kelly. Want dinner? 
 One day, we're all going to be happy. 
 That sounds nice. 
 It's really too perfect, actually. 
 I can't describe. Just hit play. It's all cued up. 
 (recorded) I told you, that makes me nervous. Me no likey. 
 But baby, my birthday's coming up. 
 Still. That's not a good enough reason. 
 Come on. A little action. A little prime time action. 
 But people might see us. 
 That's the point. That's what makes it sexxxy. Dangerous. 
 Exactly. 
 I have a few notes jotted down. 
 Oh, it's okay - 
 She dots her I's with hearts. And her L's are loopier. The L is very important. 
 Sometimes collateral damage can't be avoided. 
 (inspecting) Pretty good. I think we're ready to manufacture a document. 
 (clears his throat) Begin. "Hey Daddy. It's your birthday and you've been a very bad boy. But so has the baby. Both baby and Daddy have to get punished, only this time - 
 (Cont.) - baby makes the rules. Await further instructions at school tomorrow -- 
 (V.O. cont'd) -- Baby will be waiting where Daddy least expects her. Love, Bridgie." Yes! 
 Do you have everything? 
 We can't afford any errors. 
 I wish I could be there to see it. 
 It's a day that will live in infamy. 
 I don't hear you coming up with anything. 
 What's gotten into you? 
 Nothing, you bad girl. 
 Did you drink a bottle of Robitussin before school again? 
 See you soon, my naughty baby. 
 It's my birthday! I'm going to get a present. 
 Damn it, fuckface. What're you smiling about? You wish you were me. 
 Mr. Palmer? May I be excused? 
 Daddy's here for the Easter egg hunt. 
 Ooh, push my buttons. 
 Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You little minx. 
 (serious grownup voice) Yes, I need to get a message to Bridget Shumann. This is MENSA. 
 But I just got this note last period. 
 Well I don't have anything here for you - let me look again. Oh yes, the MENSA called. 
 Cool. They want me to be an honorary member. (pause) Is that like a sorority or something? 
 Bridgie? Come on, daddy's sick. He needs his medicine. 
 I brought our friend along. He's happy to see you. 
 What the fuck are you all looking at? 
 1 Look, he's got a hard on. 
 2 Eeeeew. 
 You're kidding me. 
 To Operation Mincemeat. 
 How does it feel to give better than you get? 
 You want some more? 
 That's my boy. 
 Sounds dangerous. 
 Have you been drinking? 
 Kelly? Bart's not here, he - 
 She's out back in her studio. 
 Kelly? 
 You did. 
 Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set your canvas up. Use one of the ones in the corner. 
 Brushes are in the jar. Paint's in the drawer. 
 Well then. 
 No. 
 Just don't talk. 
 (pause) I'm kidding. 
 (O.S.) Hey! Hey babe. 
 Miner Webber. 
 Kelly. This is Kelly - 
 Quite all right. (smiles as an afterthought) So, what do we have here, a little painting class? 
 Kelly's a friend of Bart's. He paints. 
 Oh? What's your real job? 
 That's quite an image. 
 What? 
 Whatever it takes to get you through the day. 
 I have the afternoon off. Come away with me. 
 I'm not at a good stopping point. 
 Oh, come on. They'll still be here. (to Kelly) I know you'll still be here. 
 I really shouldn't. 
 But everyone will be coming soon. And it will get all crazy, and we won't have any time to ourselves. 
 We will. I promise. 
 Like tonight? We can practice honeymoon suite. 
 Maybe. Probably. 
 Like what? 
 Just because he didn't want to picture you as a pupa? 
 He wants to be with me. What's so bad about that? 
 Well, that's sweet - 
 Hey, I can take care of myself. 
 At the end of the month. But don't ask me about it. It makes me nervous. 
 No. 
 What are you painting? 
 How? 
 Do you have any idea what you're talking about? 
 Well, some people actually say what they really think. 
 It doesn't matter. It's called being yourself. 
 Not boring. Scary and wonderful and exciting. 
 XIOU-XIOU No. 
 XIOU-XIOU Each painting is a lesson. Here - 
 XIOU-XIOU Each line has a whole drawing contained in it. Each drawing has a whole life contained in it. 
 Hey you two. I'll try not to act surprised. It might spoil the moment. 
 Keller, I think I'm missing some art supplies. Have you seen them around the house? 
 I don't know what to do with him. 
 XIOU-XIOU You son is not yet cooked. Give him time. 
 When are you going to let me give you your own show? We could do it for real. 
 XIOU-XIOU No problem. When you offer me an eighty-twenty split. 
 (to Harrison) -- But I told you I want to take German -- 
 German's a Cold War language. You can't get any kind of State Department position without more diverse linguistic training than that. You'll take Chinese. 
 Are we on the same page? 
 (mutters) Same page. 
 (to Tabby) So darling, when are you going to bite the bullet and do the seating arrangement? 
 I can't deal with that stuff, ma. I don't care who sits next to whom. I should have eloped. 
 (tentatively) Why, I've never thought about it before but that is a rather strange expression, isn't it? You wouldn't say, "Sooner or later you've got to put the grenade in your pants," would you? 
 But have you ever noticed how in movies they always bite the grenade before they throw it? 
 What an unusual conversation! Do you have similar discussions at the dinner table with your family, Kelly? 
 He talks about art. 
 BART/MATHILDA You do? 
 You come from a creative family, do you? 
 I wish my boys would talk to me about my passions. I can't get them anywhere near the subject of my garden. 
 They are fine, aren't they? 
 (ironic) Is there nothing you can't discuss? 
 Here, Kelly, try a bit of these leeks. Minnie has a way with the white sauce. 
 My dad has this friend who's a director. He's shooting a documentary for the History Channel. 
 He needs some guys to do a reenactment of some European theater battles for him. 
 I haven't asked you yet. 
 Well, if you want to. Next weekend. But you have to take it seriously. 
 From what I've seen, you play fast and loose with your characterizations. This has got to be straight up. 
 Like back in the dining room? 
 (mimics) "I noticed your magnolias. Very fine specimens." That was real? 
 (shrugs) You just seem to have your own agenda, that's all. 
 I'm just saying. I know the difference between fantasy and reality. 
 I don't know. 
 Why didn't you tell me your dad was a burn-out? 
 Kelly! I told some of your teachers about your presentation. We're all really looking forward to it. 
 What presentation? 
 Okay. Um. 
 It's nothing. I - 
 I have an extra ticket to Aerosmith this weekend. 
 Oh. Yeah, I figured. Okay. I'll see you in the dairy section, though. 
 I tracked you down. There's someone I'd like you to meet. 
 (to Kelly) Are you one too? 
 And what do you see in that? 
 I see. 
 And do you think it's brave getting trench foot and syphilis, eating another ration of spoiled frank and beans out of a dented can? 
 Yeah, that wouldn't be much fun, would it? 
 Parts of it were kind of fun though. I got separated from my platoon and lived for two weeks in the forest of the Ardennes living off what I could kill. (pause) I felt very close to the land. 
 I met him when my mom made me go around caroling with the Youth Group. 
 Does it matter? 
 I don't know. You tell me. 
 I told you not to play him for money. 
 Exactly. You should know better. What do you want. 
 Kelly! 
 That woman's calling you. 
 What a nice surprise. It's so nice to finally meet you. 
 Likewise. So, doing a little business? 
 A little is right. But I work it as much as I can. 
 So, what have you boys been up to? 
 Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home? 
 You boys should swing by Care House. There are some Vets there. 
 Oh. Well - okay. 
 I should go. But you boys should come over to our house some time. (to Bart) I know your family must get tired of him. 
 Not at all. But I'd love to, anyway. 
 What's your problem? She's pretty cute. 
 Don't you want your soda? 
 So filming's on Saturday. Can you make it? 
 Good. It's gonna be really cool. He's got an explosives expert coming. 
 What's up? 
 Maybe you should talk to my dad about it. 
 Of course. He loves you. He was talking the other day about helping you out. (ironic) Want to go to Dartmouth? 
 He was. If you applied for Spring Semester, he could "pull some strings." 
 Yeah, probably not. 
 That's bullshit. 
 Tell that to my family. They're like your fucking fan club. 
 Even Tabby likes you. 
 Well, she's inviting you to the wedding. 
 But you probably won't enjoy that much, will you? 
 Good, I'll call mom's nephew Fletcher and tell him to expect a little action. 
 He's twelve. Let me give some advice. He's very into sharks at the moment. 
 Miner and I broke up. 
 Yeah. 
 You did, huh? 
 I don't need any more bullshit right now. 
 I'm not as complicated as you think. 
 Oh. 
 There's more to it than that. 
 Thanks. 
 You like me, don't you? 
 No, I mean -- you like me. 
 Well, do something. 
 (O.S.) All right, all right. I'm going. 
 Minnie's starting dinner. Is Kelly coming over? 
 Not tonight, ma. 
 Okay, then. 
 Are you with the 101st or the 82nd? 
 Whatever. Make yourself comfortable. We'll be a while setting up. Some of the other boys are over by craft service. 
 The snack table. It's over there. Someone will come get you when we're ready. 
 Bart? Oh, Harrison's son. I don't know. 
 
 (to Kelly) And you are? 
 All right, Kelly. Let's take a look at you. 
 That's it, handsome. 
 No where. 
 I ought to fucking kill you. 
 You had to do it. 
 You just do whatever the fuck you want. And consequences don't matter, do they? 
 What the fuck do you think she's going to do, run off with you? 
 You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy. She's a Yale grad student. Talk about living in a fucking fantasy world. 
 (biting sarcasm) Once again, you've displayed your uncanny ability to nail the truth of a character. 
 Well, you're going to have to. Your father's at the hospital. 
 They think he has stomach cancer. 
 Why would you say something like that? 
 "Seems to fit." Do you understand what I just said? 
 Kelly - 
 I forgot to tell you this box was booby-trapped. 
 The concert was lame. The opening act singer ripped his leather pants during a stupid dance routine and stormed off stage. (pause, looks at his cut) Are you okay? 
 Lance? 
 Sure. I understand. 
 Um, I don't have a perfect life, if that's what you're asking. 
 Fuck you. 
 Kelly? 
 Hey. 
 We talked. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 Oh, Kelly. 
 MR. NORMAN Kelly! There you are. I was just telling the class about our special treat today. Mr. Ernswiler is going to be giving the three first-period history classes a little talk about the Civil War. 
 MR. NORMAN Let's all make our way in an orderly fashion down to the auditorium, shall we? 
 MR. NORMAN Orderly, I said orderly. 
 MR. NORMAN Well, what are we waiting for? I'm so looking forward to hearing your views. 
 For those of you who haven't had the chance to get to know Kelly, you should know he has a very interesting hobby. He takes part in reenactments of World War II battles right here in Ohio. 
 I did that too. When I was seven. 
 He has an unusual first-hand knowledge of history. We recently discovered that this extends beyond World War II to the Civil War, which he is going to discuss with you today. Kelly? 
 (to Mr. Norman) Well, go after him. 
 What, they re-assign you to the bicycle brigade? 
 Too bad, cause I'm not. Remember that little show I put on for the school? 
 Oh, come on. Pants down? Doll? Hard on? 
 And did you hear me and Bridget aren't going out anymore because of it? 
 Yeah well, let's get this over with. 
 Did you call me a homo? 
 No time like the present. 
 MR. NORMAN Stop it! 
 Get off me. 
 Bart's not here. Sorry. 
. 
 Oh Kelly. What happened? 
 Jesus. Let me see that. 
 I'm going over to see dad. 
 And you need to come. 
 At this point that's not an option. 
 It's never a good time. 
 (voice rising) It's not about you anymore -- 
 (yelling) What is wrong with you? When are you going to stop blaming us, blaming him? I'm sick of you being angry. I want to be angry! They just took out half of your father's stomach - 
 (screaming and crying) You will not tell me what's enough. You don't know about anything. All you do is fight fake battles, in the woods, on the playground. But this, right here, us - this is the real one, the only one worth anything. 
 The man I love is dying. 
 If I made a mistake, if you felt left out, I'm sorry. But I can only deal with one thing at a time. 
 Don't sit any of Mathilda's sisters next to me if you can help it. (to guest) Oh, hello. So nice to see you. Thank you for coming. 
 (to Bart) Where's the priest? 
 He should be here any minute. Calm down. 
 What the fuck are you doing? 
 I uninvited you. 
 Why are you wearing that? 
 (softening) I can't let you come in. 
 Because you know why. Just go home. 
 XIOU-XIOU Oh! Son of Eve. You startled me. 
 XIOU-XIOU Your mom made it for you. I can fix it. 
 XIOU-XIOU I never waste time. 
 XIOU-XIOU See. Everything can be mended. 
 XIOU-XIOU Oh no. I could not tell you anything. 
 Hey. Kelly. 
 Not bad. 
 Did you get punched? 
 I know the feeling. Come on in and watch some television. Don't worry, this one's bolted to the wall. As you can see, my reputation precedes me. 
 Any battles this weekend? 
 Busy, busy. 
 Answer me this: how come no one ever reenacts the Vietnam War? 
 I guess it would. 
 Folks dressed up like your mom and me. People reenacting fleeing to Canada, burning draft cards. I guess that would ruin the spirit of the thing, now wouldn't it? 
 I bet you could. 
 Kelly, is that you? 
 
 He looks just like you. 
 Hey. 
 Yeah. The have this intensive summer orientation thing. 
 Well, it's optional, but dad thinks it would be "a good way to meet people." 
 He usually is. 
 Thanks. 
 Is that everything? 
 Everything you'd let me bring. 
 Give me a break. 
 Hey. 
 I've got a summer internship at an ad agency. 
 It's all right, I guess. 
 When are you going to get a real job? 
 You can't be a stock boy your whole life. 
 Well, it was good seeing you. 
 What? 
 1 (to old soldier 2) This is boring. 
 2 Yeah. Let's see that slide of the wife again. 
 
 MR. NORMAN (to Charlie) Remarkable, remarkable. And they never knew? 
 The real kicker was moving those cutouts of tanks around. The thought we had a whole regiment over there, but it was just a couple of us and those Hollywood props. 
 That's amazing. Art playing a part in war. 
 You're damned right. We practically won the thing right there. (eyeing Sarah and Eve with approval) Now this is more like it. Anyone care to place a wager on the table? 
 If you think it would be more fun. 
 MR. NORMAN I can't imagine having more fun that I am now. 
 You're never been to a French whorehouse, I take it. 
 I have. 
 MR. NORMAN Oh, my.

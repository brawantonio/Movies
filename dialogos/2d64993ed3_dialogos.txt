 
 (SHYLY) Hi... My name is Mary O'Reilly O'Toole O'Shea and...over there is the island my friend Muffy owns... It's spring break... and she's invited us over for the weekend, and we're waiting for the ferry now to take us there... (blushing, mortified to cameraman) I don't know what else to say! 
 Something about myself? Oh, Gee... (composing herself, earnestly) Well, I want to work with handicapped children... My parents are my best Friends... Next semester I start convent school, and I... fuck on the first date. 
 CHAZ'S VOICE Whoo! Outrageous woman! Nikki, you are my kind o' gal! 
 CHAZ'S VOICE C'mon, Kit, how about you? 
 Pass. 
 CHAZ'S VOICE C'mon , Arch? Skip? 
 (ponders it with due consideration) Yeah, sure... I fuck on the first date... 
 (O.S.) Where's Rob? 
 CHAZ'S VOICE (teasing, with innuendo) Yeah, Kit, where is he? 
 (O.S.) 
 (MORE TEASING) Oh, Kit... 
 Oh, c'mon, Chaz, give me some room, will you? 
 (looks at her, persisting) Well? INT. VOLVO WAGON IN MOTION - MAIN HIGHWAY - DAY 
 (gestures, awkwardly) Here'll be fine, thanks... 
 (ABASHED) Thanks... for the lift, I mean... 
 (smiles, no reason for disappointment) It was a real lift for me, too, hon. 
 (CALLING) The rooms are all in order, double- and triple-checked, and I'm on my way... 
 Shit. 
 CLARA'S VOICE Need any help down there? 
 (puffing with the effort) No, Clara, thanks. Just trying some last minute straightening down here... god, I don't think I've ever worked so hard in my life...! 
 Sure you don't want me to stay? There's nobody gonna be around here to help till first ferry back Monday, y'know... 
 (continuing with her work) Nope, you're a peach, Clara. But this one's mine. I told my father I'd do it, and I will. My way. I don't want him to have any excuses. 
 (dubiously , turning to go) All right, then. Have a nice party. 
 (a buoyant laugh) Nice? It has to be better than nice... it's gotta be bloody unforgettable! 
 Good luck. 
 MUFFY (CONT) Bye, Clara. See you Monday. 
 Here she comes... 
 (HURRIED) Hi... is this the ferry to the St. John house? 
 I Any second now. 
 Oh, thank goodness ! I didn't know if I was on the right road... 
 Hi. Kit Graham... Nikki Brashears. 
 Nan Youngblood. 
 (needling, about the suitcase) Planning on staying a while? 
 (flushes, embarrassed) Oh, no... just some work for finals, when we get back... you don't know how far behind I am... 
 Hi. Arch Cummings . I've seen you around. Jewett Hall, right? 
 Chaz Vyshinsky. You got great legs. 
 (pointed1y, reminds him) Chaz, Arch already has her bag. 
 (volunteering, happily) Well, I only met Muffy this term in Drama Society . I volunteered to do their costumes... I like to sew... Did you see her in Ghosts? She's so talented. She was wonderful! 
 (to Nan, approvingly; in greeting) Congratulations, on finding your way. 
 
 
 (BARKS) Stand clear! 
 (GROWLS) Ok, let's go. 
 (IN MOCK-TERROR) This is it? No going back? Trapped for days on an island where men are men, and women oughta know better? 
 (BEHIND HER) Try to control yourself, Sister O'Toole. 
 
 (SUGGESTIVE ) You could tie me in chains... 
 (a low whisper) Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out... 
 Sh -i-i-t... 
 Come on if you're coming. 
 (URGENTLY) Excuse me. But we're still waiting for somebody -- 
 
 (GRUFFLY) It's Friday. My last run of the week. I don't get paid overtime. 
 But you've got to wait. They said it's the only way over. If he misses this... 
 ANGLE ­ LANDING ...followed closely by HARVEY 'HAL' EDISON, JR. 
 Wait up! 
 (to Kit, kissing her) Sorry... Nik, Chaz... (to Skip and Nan whom he doesn't know) Rob Ferris... 
 (RIGHT BEHIND ) Hi! Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr., but please call me Hal. Only my folks call me Harve... and I can't stand it. Boy, this sure is a pretty spot. 
 You're friends with... Muffy St. John? 
 (PROUDLY) Sure am. We sit together in Econ 345. I let her copy my marginal utility curves. 
 I get it. That's a joke. Preppy Skip adds his greeting. 
 (an ironical nod) Harve. 
 (correcting him, blithely) Hal... (noticing interest his badge) Springsteen, he's still the Boss! 
 (IMPATIENTLY) Ok, c'mon, I don't have all day. 
 (enthusiastically, putting down his fear) YOU all buddies? 
 Except for Skip and Nan. Them we just met. 
 (AMIABLY) But we will be. 
 
 (MEANING SKIP) Watch what you say around him, though. He's Muffy's cousin. 
 (tickled, to Skip) No kiddin'? 
 Distant. Over the horizon. Otherwise, I wouldn't be invited... (frowns, tellingly) Old money never mixes family with friends. 
 This is true. For as long as I've known her. 
 
 (JOKING) To protect her family, I guess. 
 (UNSMILING) To keep her friends. 
 (nervously, a laugh) Hey, what's this...? 
 You up for a game of stretch? 
 (still taping, to Skip) Your fly's open. 
 Eat it. 
 (undaunted, to Rob) Your fly's open. 
 (SHRUGS) Ok, so don't believe me. 
 (smiles weakly to Kit) We're off! 
 First round, the champ! 
 Y'know what I find amazin'? Muffy's her real name. I mean, I'm Harvey, but they call me Hal, so I thought, 'Muffy', it must stand for something... Muffin? 
 Muffers, Moffo, Muff-child , Muffin' stuff, the Muffster... 
 
 (GRINS) I bet you're her oldest friend. 
 (BORED) Actually, she's three months older than I am. 
 You know what I mean. 
 Harvey... are you planning a career in politics when you grow up? 
 I've given it some thought. Why? 
 Oh, just a hunch. 
 First, though, I'm hopin' to interview with her daddy's company, Southern Regional Sales, next year before graduation... Y'know, he's worth more'n 50 mill over the counter! 
 (O.S.) Jesus... 
 (LAUGHING) Go for it, big fella. 
 fastens onto Nan, immersed in one of her books. He carries his own. 
 (sitting beside her) Whatcha readin'? 
 Milton. Paradise Lost. For Professor Russo's course on the English epic... It's a shame. It's a dying form. Not too many people read it nowadays, even in college. What's yours? 
 (SHOWS HER) Suck and fuck. 
 CHAZ (CONT) The origins of American pornographic film. I'm taking an independent study this term. (the passion and commitment show) My advisor's really behind me on it. We're not gonna be sheltered college kids all our lives. Someday I'm gonna have kids -- you're gonna have kids ­ and someday that kid's gonna come up to me and say, 'God, Dad, porn's really a major part of our lives. You were there, how'd it get started?' I wanna be able to answer their questions. 
 (SMILES) Besides, it's research I can do by myself. 
 (STILL MIFFED) That's not my point -- 
 You don't want me to hitch, you want me to buy a car. OK, but I'm a state university boy, I don't have the perks like some of you private college kids do. 
 Oh, c'mon, don't pull that. 
 Kit... 
 ARCH'S VOICE (annoyed, loudly, overriding the other conversations) Hey, I'm really not interested anymore -- 
 C'mon, just one more 
 
 I said, enough's enough-- 
 One more try, double or nothing. 
 (PISSED OFF) C'mon, give it a fuckin' rest! 
 
 
 (PALE) Oh, fuck. 
 Nan screams. Skip stumbles, teetering there at the edge of the ferry. Rob and Chaz leap to their feet. The ferrymen both look up in disbelief. Arch steps forward to help. But Skip, weaving, topples and splashes overboard. He goes under. 
 (panicked, hurrying to the side) I'll get him, I'll get him! 
 SKIP'S VOICE Hi, this what you're looking for? 
 
 We got 'em! Whoo-ee, did we nail 'em! 
 (as it dawns, to Skip) April Fools... you crazy jerks. You crazy motherfuckin' jerks... somebody could've gotten hurt out there! 
 (GRINNING) 
-I-I-I-T 
 You maniacs... you almost gave us a heart attack! 
 (TO CHAZ) Well, at least we don't go in for this your-shoelace­is-untied crap! 
 (dripping, to Arch and Skip) I owe you one. 
 (smiles, to Buck in the water) How's it goin' out there? 
 That was great! 
 I was really counting on these other turkeys to save my ass. 
 Oh, too bad. 
 Sorry about that. 
 (unamused, to Buck) Ok, c'mon, get out. 
 FERRYMAN (CONT.) (to Buck, gruffly) C'mon I'm gonna need some help here. 
 FERRYMAN (CONT) And watch out for the wire! 
 Buck, look out-- 
 
 (IN DREAD) Oh, shit... 
 Buck! 
 
 (IN HORROR) Oh, god! EXT. DOCK - ISLAND - DAY 
 Get away from him! 
 They did it... them! 
 (RESTRAINING HIM) Easy Buck... it's OK... OK... There's time for Later... easy... 
 (TO ·FERRYMAN) Get him to the hospital, Cal! Take my boat! 
 All right... Let's have it. INT. MUFFY'S PASSENGER VAN - DAY 
 What's going on? Sam... what's wrong? 
 
 (IN DISGUST) Tricks. Pranks. Better ask your friends... Buck's been hurt. 'Cal just took him on over to the mainland. Just lucky I was here... 
 No, he's in Sutton Place. Why? 
 No word from him, or anybody else? 
 (STILL PUZZLED) No... 
 Just like I thought. . Burned out. Worthless... 
 We keep all the keys on the board in the kitchen, but I think there's an extra one underneath the cushion there. She points to the boat seat. Potter is much obliged. 
 (to the others, sternly) I'm glad you're stuck here, all o' you. If there's anvthin' else, or anything happens to Buck... I want to know where to find you. 
 These goddamn windows! 
 They've never been fixed... 
 Look, Skip, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You didn't know. 
 
 (BITTER) Sure. 
 
 (SIGHS) What a way to start a weekend, huh. 
 Muffy. Nothing bad ever happens to her. 
 (OVERWHELMED) Oh; Muffy... 
 Well, there's an awful lot to be done with this place. 
 You sound as if you own it. 
 I will, if all goes well. Next month when I turn 21. It's my first- stage inheritance. 
 (AMAZED) First stage? What's your second? 
 
 (DRYLY) Texas. You might be talking to your future boss, Harve. 
 Mom, I am home! 
 Yeah, I could get real used to this. 
 We used to spend our summers here before my mother died. 
 (BEAT) This is a very special place to me. 
 It's like a dream. 
 On a clear day you can see the Kennedys. 
 CHAZ'S VOICE (from the dining room) Wow, look at this...! 
 (in mock awe) Look! Our very own place settings... with our very own place cards -- with Ken or Barbie! Outasight! 
 
 (GIGGLES) Just like in Agatha Cristie. 
 (in the spirit) And sporks... 
 (QUIETLY) Sporks? 
 And napkins with little Hallmark bunnies! Gee, Muff, you really spared no expense. 
 
 (ENTERING JAUNTILY) Why not? How do you think father made all his money? 
 (ENTERING) The old-fashioned way. He inherited it. 
 (meaningfully, with her Barbie) I used to have all her outfits. 
 Don't anybody move! Chaz jumps back from the table, whipping out his videocam to record the moment, and panning them all at · .their respective places. 
 CHAZ (CONT) One of us in this room... (bellowing a mystery laugh) ...pulls his wang. 
 ...if only the choices weren't so limited. God, I'm so ready for a change. Any kind of change. 
 Well, you know, everything they say about older men? It's true. 
 Muffy! 
 Like how much older are we talking about? Twenty-six? 
 Add about thirty years. 
 I don't believe ·you, St. John! 
 (TURNING AWAY) I don't want to hear about this. 
 Come on! · 
 It was only a weekend. It's over now. (beat, shrugs) I was curious. 
 He wasn't married? 
 (BLITHELY) How should I know? 
 It was quite a weekend. 
 Come to daddy. 
 Come sit on daddy's knee, little girl... 
 My goodness, daddy, what big (BREAKING UP) ...what big... teeth you have. 
 (quietly, with deliberation) The poor boy can say, "Fuck you, Dad. I'm my own person." What is his father going to do? Kick him out of the house? Disinherit him? His life won't have changed that much. He's got nothing to lose. 
. 
 His father's love. 
 That's already been lost. Died a long, long time ago. 
 (SOFTLY) Skip, you're giving up. You're giving up before you've even gotten started. 
 (BEAT) Look at how young we all are. How young and foolish and innocent and stupid... 
 Boy, Muff, you sure know how to make a guy look forward to dessert. 
 Please, God, let it be ding dongs. 
 St. John hospitality taken to the extreme. 
 I think it's real friendly. Makes me feel right at home. 
 How friendly will we feel once we've finished with those beans? 
 
 You guys! 
 So it's going to be one of those dinners, huh? 
 
 I wonder how Buck is doing? 
 
 Do you think we should call or something? 
 (QUIETLY) I'll call later. 
 I think we should change the subject. 
 Well, Harvey's got his job interview all figured out, but what about the rest of us? Anybody know what they're going to be doing come graduation? 
. 
 Good choice, Arch. 
 I can't decide. I'd like to go to graduate school in English. I love the sound of our language. But I'm afraid there's not much future in it. 
 I mean, what are you' supposed to do with a liberal arts major anyway? 
 You fill out a lot of forms, and then some friend of your family gives you a job delivering mail in his ·corporation... 
 This is really incredible. Look at us... Here we are... privileged, independent, the hope of the future... and most of us still don't know what we're going to do with our lives! 
 (PROUDLY) Rob knows. He's going to medical school. 
 Kit... 
 (EXCITEDLY) Hey, no shit? You got early acceptance? 
 (reddens, to Kit) We can talk about it some other time. 
 Why? You had your meeting with your counselor, didn't you? 
 (OBSERVANTLY) Kit... I don't think Rob really wants to talk about it in front of everybody. 
 (STUBBORNLY) No, I don't mind. 
 
 (AT MUFFY) Why not? We're all friends. 
 
 (LAUGHS) Well, sorta... 
 He said to forget it. 
 ROB (CONT.) 
 (WITH DIFFICULTY) He said my grades might be OK; but that basically I possess an essential lack of seriousness, and that's what they look for. 
 Oh, shit, him too? That's what my guy said! An' I said, you're kidding! How can anybody be serious about anything when some moron can steal a bomb or push a button and blow the rest of us right into Mad Max. He wasn't impressed. 
 He's right. That's bullshit on parade. 
 Well fuck you. It sounded good at the time. 
 What is this? Dom Perignon sparkling rose? 
 It smells like Ripple. 
 You've outdone yourself again, St. John. 
 Who was that? 
 (QUIETLY) Skip. 
 (TENTATIVELY) Can I make a toast? 
 NAN (CONT.) Well... Someone once said to me to cherish the friends you make in 
-- 
 I cherish all the friends I make. 
 (CONTINUING) Because... they'll be the friends you cherish most the rest of your life. So, well, here's to us... here's to my life... because I'm very glad to be here, and to be a part of all of you... 
 Muffy, anything you want to add to that? 
 Why me? 
 Because you're the hostess. 
 In his "Life of Johnson" James Boswell said, "We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses, there is at last one which makes the heart run over." 
 (GRINNING MISCHIEVOUSLY) April Fool. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY ­ NIGHT 
 Goodnight. 
 Goodnight. 
 Oh, great. Quarantine. 
 (IMPISHLY) Just holler if you need anything. 
 Another room. 
 (TURNS) Muffy... 
 
 (SMILES) Arch is sweet, but he's only got two expressions. Collar up and collar down. 
 I found that out-- 
 (BEAT) I guess what I'm trying to say is... you always seem to get there first... but this time Chaz is mine, OK? 
 (AMUSED) What about Hal? 
 ' Harvey? Mr. Junior Achievement? Oh please... 
 Hey, all right... ladies, we are qonna have privacy... 
 ARCH (CONT.) You gotta be kiddin'... 
 (unloading his gear). Unless Muffy knows something about us we don't. 
 (to himself; rehearsing) Don't tell me you've never thought of me in that way, Muffy. I felt a spark between us the very first moment we laid eyes on each other... in Econ 345. Why, just think of it, Muffy... with my talent and your... money. 
 (CONTINUED) Why just think of it... Muffers, with my raw... driving talent and your... 
 HARVEY (CONT.) ...and your... 
 
 
 RETURN ­ HARVEY 
 (FINALLY) Wrong room. 
 Jesus... 
 Goodnight. 
 G'night. 
 Rob? 
 You still angry with me? About dinner? 
 No. I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm just angry. 
 (burning his fingers) Ouch! Jesus! 
 Very funny. 
 
 (COLLECTS HERSELF) Arch do you know what time it is? 
 Um-hmm. 
 (turning down his collar) Goodnight, Arch. 
 
 
 
 Hello? 
 Who's there? 
 (hushed, at door) Muffy? 
 MUFFY'S VOICE (UNCERTAINLY) Yes? 
 You OK? 
 MUFFY'S VOICE (DISTANTLY) Yes... Thank you... 
 (reluctantly, puzzled) OK... well, goodnight... 
 
 (BRISKLY) Good morning! 
 
 
 I... I was hungry... 
 Morning! She backs away from him, scurrying up the stairs. 
 I... forgot to get dressed... 
 Who made her night? 
 (always in search of more players) Where's Skip? 
 That depends on what he's on. 
 You gotta be kidding... 
 (teasingly, an invitation) Nan? What about it? 
 Oh, no, thanks. (FALSELY) Besides, I thought I'd wait and see what Muffy wanted to do... 
 Rob? What's wrong? 
 I swear it wasn't this cold yesterday . 
 Are you giving up? 
 (turning to her; gently) What about you? What about your future? You're the one with the four point. (DEJECTED) ...maybe it's crazy--you investing so much energy in me. 
 (QUIETLY) I don't know. I'm scared. I don't know if I want what Mom and everybody else expects of me. I don't want to go to law school. 
 (PROTESTING) You've got a great mind 
 ...only it's not made up. 
 Great... Do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are? 
 It's made up about one thing though. 
 Yeah? What's that? She looks up and kisses him softly. 
 Will you feel the same about me a year from now? Two years, five years from now? 
 Skip! You sonofabitch! 
 
 Skip... Skip! 
 (commentary while he tapes) Respectable young Quaker couple returning after quiet afternoon of nonviolent sex. 
 (CALLING ) Well, how was it? 
 Where's Skip? Anybody seen him? 
 Who wants to know? 
 Goddammit, can't you give me a straight answer! 
 (FRANTICALLY) We saw him... on a boat... drifting by the pier. He wasn't movinq. He looked dead... unless he was joking...! 
 Well, if it was Skip... 
 I saw his face! 
 (DEMANDINGLY) Has anybody seen him since last night? 
 (noticing their distress ) Something wrong? 
 Wait! I'll go with you! 
 Me too! 
 (aloud: for Skip) Hey, asshole! 
 Wait a minute! Look at this! 
 This was Skip's. 
 What do you think? That guy on the ferry? 
 I don't know. I don't know what to think. 
 I say we go looking for him, him or Skip. One of them's bound to still be around... somewhere. 
 You mean split up? 
 Let's not take any chances. He was... He was pretty big. 
 No sucker's taken me yet. 
 I know why you're avoiding me... 
 (DISTRAUGHT) I guess it's your idea of a joke... that's why you invited me. How'd you find out? From one of his preppy 'friends'? Who else have you told?... Who else knows, except the father! 
 (ASTONISHED) I... don't know what you're talking about. 
 Oh? The tape just got there? You know very well... my abortion! 
 (SHEEPISHLY) Sorry... I was just checkin' to make sure everybody was all right. 
 Harvey? No kidding'? 
 (NERVOUSLY) What d'you, mean? 
 Oh, c'mon. 
 Hey, shithead! chickendick!... yeah, you! Skip! 
 
 
 
 (THUNDERING ) Skip! 
 
 Skip? 
 
 
 Skip? 
 
 (calling to him) No Skip? 
 No luck. 
 (TO CHAZ) Where's Arch? 
 He isn't with you? 
 I don't like this... I definitely don't think I like this... 
 I think it's about time we called the police. 
 Eight-two-four-eight. Constable Potter has an office at his home. 
 (TO ROB) I don't think we should wait any longer... 
 (BEAT) It'll calm our nerves... 
 I didn't know what kind anybody would like so I just... got them all... 
 Let me help. 
 (CAREFULLY) Has he reached the Constable? 
 Rob? No, we haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet. 
 L1UFFY Oh... ·the main... it's probably broken. 
 (STUNNED) No water? 
 What's happening. 
 No water. 
 What! 
 It happens sometime... But there's still the well all the island homes have some kind of pump... or well... for emergencies. 
 Jesus. I'll go. Just point me in the right direction. 
 (GALLANTLY) Not without me. 
 (bearing up under Kit's stare) I'm not worried. I'm sure those two... Skip and Art... they're just up to some kind of stupid trick . . . 
 (UNCOMFORTABLY) I don't think you should really do that. 
 (SEEING) Is that it? 
 Here, let me do it. I've probably had more experience than you. 
 You mean, back home on the farm? 
 I know you think I'm a hick, but I'd like to change your mind about that, if you'd only give me the chance. 
 Why? 
 Because, I'd really like to plow your field. 
 
 (SMILES" IMPRESSED) Draw me some water. 
 Aw, crap... 
 What happened? 
 I lost the bucket. 
 Harve. 
 Hal. The rope was rotten, any fool coulda seen that. 
 You didn't. 
 Here, shine your light down so I can get a fix on it. 
 Oh... oh, Jesus! 
 (STARTLED} ...what... 
 Stay back! Don't look! 
 I'm a big girl now. I think I ·can handle a few spiders and

 (BREATHLESS) What is it? 
 
 (ASHEN) You don't want to know. 
 (STILL PANICKED) In the well ! Oh, God, the well! 
 
 (COLD FEAR) We have to leave, all of us, we have to get away. 
 (closing the well cover) We can't get away. Everyone back into the house . Now. (JUMPING DOWN) Let's go! 
 It's okay, Nikki. With the others... they were outdoors. But we're inside now, and we're safe. 
 (QUIETLY) It's all because of what happened on the ferry, isn't it? 
 (HIMSELF UNNERVED) It was an accident. Don't they know that? 
 Muffy, where do you keep your guns? 
 
 (BLANKLY) Guns? We don't keep guns in this house. 
 (handing Nikki the glass) Here. 
 , Oh, God! Not the water! 
 It's all right. It's Perrier. 
 (DESPERATELY) Hello! 
 What are you talking about? 
 (LISTENS) That ain't possible . 
 (LISTENS) And I'm telling you, I'm here at the hospital now visiting Buck. He came out of surgery last night--It might interest you to know he'll be all right-- and Cal's been here too, the whole time. 
 (PLEADING ) Constable?... 
 (LISTENS) Here. She's all right. 
 (LISTENS) With Muffy? What do you mean? 
 (FINALLY) Yes, all right... Please... Please hurry. 
 (anything, but jubilant) He's on his way. We're supposed to wait here... to stay together... 
 What about the ferryman? 
 It isn't him. They've been together all day. 
 What? 
 I don't understand. 
 (STANDING) I don't either. 
 (BEAT) He's going to send up a flare as he's nearing the dock. Then we're to go down as a group to meet him there. (MOVING AWAY) In the meantime... we just wait. 
. CLOSE - THE 
 
 (UNNATURALLY COMPOSED) It's my father's study. 
 (NERVOUSLY) I just came in to make sure everything was secure to lock the windows. 
 Good idea. Sometimes... with the tides... it can take someone all night to get here from the mainland... and even then, sometimes they don't make it... 
 (peering out the window) What's taking him so long? 
 (quietly; without conviction) It could be the tides. 
 Wait a minute. Aren't we supposed to be staying together? Where're Muffy and Rob? 
 Rob's checking the back of the house. 
 And Muffy? 
 She's been acting less than normal anyway. 
 (picking up on it) What do you mean? 
 You mean all day and you haven't noticed? 
 Well, who isn't? 
 ...and those nurse's shoes. 
 What nurse's shoes? 
 The clodhoppers she's been wearing today... crepe soles... 
 She was arguing with Nan in the hall, before you and Rob... before you came back alone. 
 About something Nan found in her room. 
 What? 
 (EMBARRASSED) Something about an abortion. 
 I found somethin"g in my room, too 
 ...only I don't think it was intended for me . 
 (SARCASTIC ) Oh, really? 
 (to Chaz; defending Nikki) And What did you find? 
 I didn't find anything. 
 We're supposed to believe that? 
 That's right. (TRUMPING HIM) I spent the night with Nikki. 
 (BEAT) What about you? 
 What about me? 
 What's your little secret? 
 (EVASIVELY) I don't know What you're talking about. 
 Oh, come on, sport. I walked in on you last night , and you were acting like your ass was on fire... 
 It wasn't anything... Just some clippings... of some car accidents. 
 (INSINUATING) Nothing personal in that, I suppose? 
 No! Who hasn't been in a car accident? It's a common thing. 
 I haven't. 
 (QUIETLY) What I'd like to know is, how did Muffy find out about these things and why -- ? 
 Stop it! Just stop it all of you! 
 (BEAT) What is wrong with us? Nhat happened to all our talk about friendship, and undying loyalty? (looking from one to the other) Do you know what we're saying? That we're actually sitting here discussing the possibility that Muffy, a generous friend, has invited us all here to -- 
 I'm going upstairs. 
 Muffy? We should all stay together. 
 This is my house. 
 (BEAT) I'll be in my room. 
 (FINALLY) She's got a point. (STANDING) We're starting to get on each other's nerves. 
 As long as we all stay within shouting distance of each other... 
 (TO CHAZ) You coming? 
 I'm goinq to find the way up to the attic. 
 Why? 
 I'm sure we can watch for the Constable better from up there. 
 It's all right. I can keep watch on the stairs. 
 Nikki, come on... 
 What do you mean, Nikki, come on? Don't give me any of this Nikki, come on. 
 What are you doing? 
 Look, stay if you like. Lock your door. Dig a trench. Hang out. But once I leave this place, I'm never coming back. 
 (catching up to her) We're all supposed to stay together here. 
 Yeah, that's been real effective... 
 So what are you going to do? Just waltz on down to the pier. By yourself. Check your bag with the porter. Then wait for an ocean liner to happen by and pick you up. Is that it? 
, (pushing past him) I can't stay here any longer. 
 What if the Constable never even comes? 
 Then I'll swim all the way back to the mainland... I can be strong if I have to. INT.'S ROOM - NIGHT 
 Look, just relax-- 
 Three people are dead and you're telling me to relax? 
 Nikki, now just hold on a minute, and look at me. Look at me. 
 CHAZ (CONT.) Now, am I nervous? Yes. Maybe even a little bit scared? Yes. Am I running around like a chicken with its head cut off? 
 Nice image. 
 No. 
 (BEAT) I mean, come on, babe. Lighten up a little, huh? 
 CHAZ (CONT.) (MUFFLED) Look at this. What, me worry? 
 Very funny, Chaz. 
 (MUFFLED) You've got to look on the bright side of things. Everything'll be all right... Huh? Huh? 
 Don't be a jerk. 
 (MUFFLED) Oh. Now I'm turning you on. Right? 
, Take that thing off. 
 (MUFFLED) Why? I kind of like it in here. (moving blindly toward her) Kiss me, you savage she-devil. 
 Get out of here. 
 (MUFFLED) Ooooh, stop it some more. I love it when you're rough. 
 (MUFFLED) Course it would help a little if I could breathe in here. For when things start to get really passionate. 
 (BEAT) Nikki? 
 (NOTICING) Real subtle, Chaz. 
 NIKKI (CONT.) Now I'm supposed to throw off my clothes and jump on you? Just wind her up and watch her go? You've got a lot to learn, buddy. 
 (looking at his crotch again) What is this? Show and tell? 
 (BEAT) I'll show you mine if you show me yours? 
 (BEAT) Well, forget it... You may as well just stick it back in your pants. 
 (BEAT) Chaz?... Chaz? 
 (NO ANSWER) Say something, goddammit! 
 (O.S.) No lights. 
 No one's been up here in years. 
. 
 Can you see him? 
 NO. There must not be a light on the boat. 
 Or... he's chosen not to use it. 
 Kit? He said something else on the phone, about Muffy. 
 What? 
 He said not to trust anybody. That's why we were to stay together. No one was to be left alone with anyone else... Then he said, especially not with Muffy. 
 So that's why you let her go upstairs? 
 That's why I let her go. 
 
 (BEAT) What did he mean by that? 
 I don't know. He wouldn't explain it. 
 But that's ridiculous... 
 Is it? He's known her longer than we have. 
 Rob, wait a minute. What's that? 
 Where? 
 It's just the dolls. 
 She's been up here. 
 So? She moves toward them while Rob stays by the windows looking out. As she gets closer to the dolls, however, Kit realizes that they have not just been stuck there haphazardly. 
 (ALARMED) Rob? 
 
 Jesus... 
 (LOSING IT) Rob? . . . 
 It's Arch and Skip and Nan. 
 Rob??... 
 Wait... 
 What are these other two? 
 He's here! 
 Come on! 
 Hal! 
 Nikki? 
 Chaz?... Nikki?... 
 Rob!!! 
 (ENTERING) I can't find Hal-- 
 Rob, what about Muffy? 
 Forget her! 
 (STOPPING HIM) She's my friend! 
 (KNOCKING) Muffy! Muffy!! 
 (pulling her away) Let's go. 
 This way! 
 (yanking her away) Forget the doors! 
 (in guarded approach) Constable... Mr. Potter? 
 (WHISPERING) If there's another flare, we can signal him. 
 Maybe he went on to the house. 
 Shit... no key! 
 Rob! 
 
 
 "...Pursuant to our previous communication, please be advised that the patient under discussion has still not been found and returned to custody, and it now believed to be attempting to return to her home in your jurisdiction. If encountered, exercise extreme caution and notify us immediately, as Miss St. John has ·been a patient here for three years and is still considered incorrigibly unstable and extremely dangerous..." 
 Miss .St. John? What's it talking about? Muffy hasn't been in any state mental institution for the last three years -- she's been at Vassar! 
 I don't know... but we've gotta get this boat started. 
 How? 
 The house. Didn't Muffy say there was another key back in the kitchen? 
 
 (IN DREAD) Oh, no... 
 We've got no choice. 
 I know. 
 Shit. 
 
 Rob? 
 Huh? 
 Rob, I really don't want to go back there. 
 I know. 
 Shit. 
 I'd have you stay here, but-- 
 No. 
 
 (BEAT) Listen, Kit, we'll get out of here, I promise you. We've been through so much together... 
 (BEING BRAVE) Okay. 
 Well... 
 Yeah... 
 Let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 Shit... 
 Rob, look! The doors. They've been closed. 
 Come on. 
 There. He is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot space of clear lawn. 
 That's how we're going in. 
 Are you with me? 
 (moving through darkness) The stairs... Where are the stairs?... 
 What's that? 
 
 (FEARFULLY) Rob... 
 Muffy's clothes... 
 (PUZZLED) I don't get it. 
 (an urgent whisper) Rob! 
 Oh, god... oh no!... 
 ...the picture of the girls in the study... the letter... what the Constable was trying to tell you... It's not Muffy it's her twin sister, Buffy! She has a twin sister! Rob's eyes have a glazed look. They are fixed somewhere else. 
 Rob, don't you see? 
 (BEAT) Rob? 
 (HUSHED) Rob! 
 Pull it away... 
 (too frightened to move) Rob? 
 Pull it away! 
 
 
 The boat key... it's gotta be here... 
 
 
 Kit... I 
 
 
 
 No... 
 Kit! Let me out! Let me out of here! Kit!! 
 (O.S.) Rob!!! 
 (POUNDING FUTILELY) Kit! Run, Kit, run! 
 Kit! I love you! 
 Buffy?... please, we didn't mean any harm... we're leaving... we just want to go home... please... please... 
 (for all he's worth) Kit! I love you! I love you, Kit! 
 
 I love you too, babe. 
 No... Oh, God... 
 (LOOKING AROUND) What.... ? 
 (wrought with emotion) Oh, fuck you!! Fuck you, you guys!! 
 Kit! ! 
 Ki--! 
 You guys are really terrific. I love you all. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart for being such good sports. 
 (STILL SHAKEN) Oh, sure. Quite welcome. Any time. 
 Rob, you and Kit, you two were the best. You figured it all out. The clues really worked. 
 What clues? 
 What's this all about? And don't anyone say "April Fool's" or I'll smack them in the teeth. 
 How about if I told you it was the script for a weekend special that's going to help me keep this house... 
 (SMILING) Look, next month I get the house as part of my inheritance, it's true, but only if I can show my father that it can carry itself... what with taxes and expenses. Otherwise, he'll just sell it out of the family. So, I'm planning on turning it into a country inn. Not just another stuffy old run-of-the-mill country inn, but one that specializes in offering once-in-a lifetime Whodunit Weekends. I needed a rehearsal. I had to try out the idea on somebody. 
 
 (TO OTHERS) And you guys played along? 
 Don't look at me! 
 We all got sucked in just as bad as you! 
 Once they were killed off, yes. Everybody had to cooperate. Otherwise, none of it would have worked! 
 So I guess there's no crazy twin sister Buffy? 
 Oh, there's a crazy twin all right, but his name isn't Buffy. 
 His name? 
 Skip?! 
 He's your brother?! 
 You bastard, you were in on the whole deal, too. 
 (PROTESTING) Only the set-up. Muffy told me to say I was her cousin and to pull that prank on the ferry. I had no idea what was going to happen with Buck. 
 (INTRODUCING) Buck Williams. make-up artist par excellence, from Hollywood. 
 Here, catch. 
 Just some old props I redressed with the help of photographs Muffy sent me. 
 It sure fooled me. 
 (TO SKIP) So what castle are you going to inherit? 
 (CRITICALLY) Well, first he's got to prove he can manage his own allowance. 
 (to the Constable) Which means, I guess, that you're no constable either. 
 Kit Graham, meet my Uncle Frank St. John of St. John et Freres, Wall Street. 
 Hi! Harvey "Hal" Edison, Jr. Pleased to meet you, sir. 
 Usually we don't even see Uncle Frank in the summer, he's so busy. But this time he made an exception. 
 I haven't had this much fun since my Hasty pudding Show sophomore year at Harvard. God, lowe you kids! 
 (EAGERLY) How'd I do? I never did no acting before. Boy, was I shaking! 
 Cal's our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands around here... but I thought he was up to the dramatic challenge. 
 (BEAT: SMILING) Well, that's it. Now you know it all. 
 We have been had. 
 You're lucky you didn't get yourself killed. 
 (LAUGHING) I almost did with Harvey. And who could know there would be a snake out in the woods with Arch? But with the paying guests, they'll know what they're in for: and the scenario won't be nearly so extreme. 
 Otherwise, even Lloyd's of London won't cover you. 
 ...And I regret that, well, some of those fake clues I planted in the bedrooms I guess were taken too seriously. I'm sorry about that. 
 You're telling me. Man, when I was swinging around out there in the woods, I nearly crapped my pants. 
 (QUIETLY) Arch? You browned your trousers? 
 
 (BEAT; STAMMERING) Well... I... 
 (GOOD-NATUREDLY) It's all right, Arch. They'll be out of the dryer soon. 
 Great ham. 
 Great eggs. 
 (TEASING) Just what we need. Another country inn. 
 Well, if the food's any indication, it's already half-way there. 
 Pass the toxic wastes, please. 
 Boy, what a difference being alive makes. 
 
 (TURNS; SOFTLY) I don't care what Columbia says about you. 
 I do. 
 
 (BEAT) Is this the road to med school? 
 I think it is. I'm going to try. 
 But if I make it or not, no matter what happens, we'll be together? You and me? 
 (QUIETLY) If that's what you want. 
 (HUGGING HER) That's what I want. Muffy enters with a stack of dishes, followed by Nan who quietly sets her plate on the counter and leaves. 
 Where's Nikki? 
 I don't know. Too much champagne? 
 (STILL GASPING) God... don't tell me that was something you learned on the farm! 
 I'll make a full and glowing report to your father tomorrow so he can draw up the deed along with the other trust papers for Wednesday's signing. I'm so proud of you. 
 (BEAT) I wish I could say the same about your brother. 
 Oh, Uncle Frank, he's been a great help this weekend, really. Let me get him out here so you can-- 
 I've already spoken with him. 
 (embarrassed to be overhearing) Excuse me. He turns and walks back into the house. 
 Come on! Let's go! 
 Well, I hate to say it -- I still ought to kill you -- but thanks. (THEY HUG) See you back there. 
 Come on. If time is money, we're losing a fortune. 
 Nan! 
 Let me say again how sorry I am. It wasn't intended. 
 And now all is forgiven. I played along, didn't I? What's done is done. 
 (BEAT) I've learned a lot, Muffy, I really have. I suppose I should say thank you, but I don't think I would be able to without it sounding false. So I'll just say goodbye. (beat; an afterthought) Thanks for showing me your house. 
 Cal, I want to thank you personally. You've been a real sport about this. 
 I know you've had your eye on that p1ace ever since we were kids. And I'm sure we could make a deal with you. I know you haven't been spending your money on anything else all these years... But... this time it just isn't in the cards. 
 Yes, that's the way. 
 This time, no funny business. 
 
 (BEAT) Feeling better? 
 (QUIETLY) I'm okay now, thanks. 
 Chaz, I'm sorry. 
 Why? What do we mean to each other anyway? 
 More than this a couple of days ago. 
 
 (SMILES SADLY) A couple of days ago... A couple of days ago I was a great, young, budding filmmaker who was going to turn pornography into high art. Today I'm just a stupid college kid with a toy camera and about as much idea as where he's going as... as... 
 (TENDERLY) Don't be down. 
 Sure. 
 I'll tell you what I've learned from all this. I'm tired of having one fling after another. I don't want any more of that. I want a boyfriend. 
 (BEAT) Chaz? Will you be my boyfriend? 
 Some party, huh? 
 (REFLECTIVELY) You know what I think's weird?... how, when we thought 'Buck here got hurt because of Skip's prank, and when things started happening and we thought maybe some of us were getting killed, how we all just kind of naturally accepted the fact that it was 'oh , yeah, sure, because of the prank.' 
 
 (FROWNS) What're you talking about? 
 Well, it's like pranks really piss people off. It unleashes things, you know? Makes any kind of behavior possible, and we accept it. 
 When anything g.oes, everything goes. 
 Yeah. 
 What really amazes me is how easy we made it for her. Everyone was just out for himself. We could've stopped Muffy cold if we'd only stuck together, if we'd only worked like a team. 
 Yeah, she really got us good. 
 Well, I know what I'd do, if I wasn't her brother... 
 (almost without thinking) Go back and give her a taste of her own medicine, that's what we should do. 
 (shrugs, smiling) Did I say anything? The others look at each other, a beat, registering. 
 Hey... 
 Go back and scare the shit outta her for a change? Outrageous! 
 She sure wouldn't be expecting it...! 
 (EXCLUDING HIMSELF) Well, I don't know. I got a stack o' books this high... 
 (stepping into the fray) Harvey's right. (to them all) Look, what're you talking about? We've had our fun. Now we got work to do. 
 Yeah. Enough's enough. At least for me anyway. 
 Pussies. 
 Well, I kinda like the idea -- and I don't have work to get back to. 
 (looks up, in surprise) Kit... 
 
 (DECIDEDLYL Muffy can dish it out. It might be interesting to see if she can take it. 
 All right! A real catfight! 
 (open-mouthed at her) I don't believe you... 
 (PROVOCATIVELY) Just because you've decided to get serious about your life, doesn't mean the rest of us can't have our fun 
 (whoops, turning) Buck, got any spare professional tricks you could throw our way! 
 So how many does that make us? 
 (EXCLUDING HIMSELF) Much as I'd like to... 
 (GENTEELLY) No, I don't think so, thank you. 
 (EMPHATICALLY) Four. 
 (one of the four) Outasight! 
 Cal, we want to get back to the island. 
 Now? You just left 
 I know. 
 [PONDERING) ...Well, not in this... 
 (SMILES SLIGHTLY) ...but you might find something around after we dock. 
 (SLEEPILY) H'lo? 
 (CHEERILY) Hi, it's me. Surprise. 
 (grumpily, stirring) What'd you forget now? 
 Nothing. Just calling to tell you the party's not over. 
 I know. The clean-up's going to take Clara and me at least a week. 
 No, I mean, some of the gang's planning on coming back to give you some of your own medicine. 
 
 You're kidding. 
 Does a bear shit in the woods? 
 Those bastards... 
 Hey, they're your friends. 
 Which ones? 
 That wouldn't be very sporting if I told you, would it? 
 
 (INSISTENT) Skip... 
 Rob and Kit and Nikki and Chaz. 
 Figures... Thanks. 
 Well, Uncle Frank told me about his recommendations. So, I didn't want you to think there were any hard feelings. 
 (AFFECTIONATELY) Oh, Skip, you dope. You know Daddy'll come around just as soon as you decide to buckle down. 
 Yeah... 
 (BEAT) Anyway, don't let the bastards eat you up. 
 I'll try not to act too surprised when they arrive. 
 I love you, Sis. 
 You too, goofball. 
 (O.S.) Asshole. 
 I beg your pardon? 
 It was even your idea. 
 A petty consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. 
 Bullshit. St. John blood is thicker than water, that's what you mean. 
 (ARCHLY SARCASTIC) Don't you know? Old money sticks together. 
 Well, can I look you up in a couple of months? Maybe you could arrange a job interview for me. 
 Sure, sure . (reaches into his pocket) Here's my card. 
 (TAKING IT) Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. I sure appreciate it, and it's been a real pleasure meeting you. 
 Hey, wait a minute! There's no phone number here! No address! No nothing! Too late. Uncle Frank is driving away. He speeds past Skip who is walking down the road further along. He doesn't even stop for his own nephew. 
 What the fuck was he talking about anyway? We might find something around after we dock? 
 What the fuck do you think he was talking about? 
 Oh. 
 (O.S.) Hey! What are you two doing down there?! 
 Well, now we've been identified. 
 Swell. 
 It's getting late. 
 What a great idea this was. 
 
 (CALLING} We got one! 
 I thought we looked there an hour ago. 
 Who cares? Let's get this show on the road! 
 (calling back to them) Did you find a key? How're we going to get the motor started? 
 (AWKWARDLY) Muffy, hi! Surprise! 
 Nikki, what on earth are you doing here? Is something wrong? 
 No, no, nothing's wrong. Chaz and I just figured there was nothing we had to get back to that couldn't wait and you could probably use a hand with the clean-up. It's our way of saying thank you. 
 Oh, great. Where is Chaz? 
 Putting the boat up in the old boathouse. He'll be up in a minute. 
 I wonder what's keeping Chaz? He should have been up here by now. 
 Maybe he stopped to shit in the woods. You know Chaz. 
 Still... I'm beginning to not like this. 
 By the way, where did you get the boat to come back here? 
 The boat? Oh, Cal gave us one. 
 I see. 
. 
 Listen, I need a drink of water. (RISING) You just stay here. I can get it myself. 
 What about your water? 
 Oh', uh, I drank 'it in there. 
 (BEAT) Listen. Muffy , I'm really getting worried about Chaz. I think we should go out and see what's happened. 
 That's okay. You go. I'll wait here. 
 No, really. I don't want to go alone. I'm still scared from last night. Please come with me. 
 I'm sure Chaz is fine. I'll stay here by the phone just in case. It's safer this way. 
 (BEAT) Do you want a flashlight? 
 (IRRITATED) No, that's okay. I'll be fine. 
 (MUTTERING) Shit. 
 Fuck! 
 Fuck!! Who dug the goddamn swimming pool?!? She drags herself out. 
 (CALLING BACK) Yeah! 
 . We have to go to plan B. 
 She wouldn't come out? Doesn't she care about me? 
 A lot goddamn, fucking better than I do! 
 , Muffy! Muffy! Come quick! It's Chaz... INT . LIVING ROOM - SAME 
 (RUNNING IN) ...he's hurt! Oh, Godl! 
 Muffy!! 
 Muff--!!! 
 
 (RISING PANIC) Muffy? 
 (O.S,) (HYSTERICAL) Chaz!! Chaz!! 
 Chaz, get up! ·Hurry, Chaz!... come on! 
 Chaz, stop playing around! Get up!! 
 Chaz! 
 (hissing, pretending to be dead) Will you quit kicking me? It hurts. 
 It's supposed to hurt! The game's over! Get up! 
 (still not moving) No. I'm dead. You're blowing the whole thing. Where's Muffy? 
 (SHRIEKING) Muffy IS dead!!! In the house!!! (WHIMPERING) Oh, God... 
 (sitting up suddenly) What? 
 (turning to the woods) Kit! Kit, come out! 
 What's going on? 
 She's gone! 
 What?... 
 Look, she's been dragged away. 
 (PANICKING) Chaz! somebody's still in this house! 
 We could follow the trail. 
 
 (DREAD) Oh, no... what about Rob? 
 (HALF BEAT) Rob!! 
 Rob...? 
 (dropping to her knees) Rob? Rob?? (shaking him: wailing) Rob!!! (dissolving into tears) It was only a game! 
 
 (SCARED SHITLESS) What the fuck is going on here?! 
 (POINTING) Chaz, look! 
 (DAZED) This was Nan's... 
 (TREMBLING) Nan... 
 Muffy! 
 Good job, you guys. I'm really scared. (LOOKING DOWN) The fun's over, Rob. 
 (tears in her eyes) Muffy, he's dead! 
 Somebody else is here! In this house! 
 Sure. Sure. 
 (BENDING OVER) Let's see if the dead are ticklish, shall we? 
 (pulling her away; screaming) Don't you touch him!! 
 Okay, okay, take it easy. 
 Muffy, it's not a game anymore! 
 (ALARMED) What the--? 
 Muffy! Stop him! Help! He's killing me! Oh, God! He's killing me! 
 (RAVING) It's all over, Muffy! Everything'll be mine! 
 Skip! No! ! !

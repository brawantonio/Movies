 Good luck. 
 We don't get many ladies in here. So your husband approves of you working? 
 (quiet; a soft Southern lilt) My husband and I are separated. 
 
 Sir, I realize I have no employment experience... but I sure need this job. I have a daughter to support. 
 (PAUSE) I'm not very good at tooting my own horn... but I love to paint, and if I could just show you my portfolio... He is baffled. Margaret pulls out a large ARTIST'S PORTFOLIO. She opens it, riffling through the pictures... 
 I studied at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville, then took Illustration classes in New York. Here's a pastel I did... here's some fashion design... a portrait in charcoal... though I enjoy mixing mediums, preferably oil and ink... She's alive, enthused. The guy shakes his head. 
 You do understand this is a furniture company? 
 CLOSEUP - MARGARET A strained smile. 
 DEE-ANN Sugar, you made it! You're in North Beach! 
 Deirdre, look at you! 
 DEE-ANN 
 "Dee-Ann"?! 
 DEE-ANN Yeah, I know. But I hit this scene... and "Deirdre" just sounded like something my mother would call me. Margaret giggles. 
 DEE-ANN So are you flipping for all this?! Are you settled? How's Jane? 
 Jane -- is swell. She's started in a sweet little school. 
 (PAUSE) Though... it's hard without her father. I'm not sure we can do this... The thought hangs, and Margaret gets emotional. Teary-eyed. 
 DEE-ANN Oh stop that. You're better off. Between us, I never liked Frank. 
 
 DEE-ANN Exactly. That's why I couldn't speak up. But if I ever see you wrong off again, I will tell you. 
 (LONG BEAT) Now come on. Let's have some fun. WIDE - They start WALKING. Dee-Ann gestures. 
 DEE-ANN Toss off your middle-class preconceptions! This is Pompeii! We're livin' in the volcano!! For jazz, check up the hungry i. For Italian, Vanessi's. For salvation, try the Buddhist temple. For art, the Six Gallery -- They pass a GALLERY. The displays are stark, Calder-like MOBILES and found-object SCULPTURES. Margaret stares, unsure. 
 Do they only show Modern? 
 DEE-ANN Everyone only shows Modern! 
 (SHE POINTS) In the basement, they've got espresso. 
 What's espresso? 
 DEE-ANN You've got a lot to learn! 
 Your stuff is cute. How much? 
 Today's a special: Two dollars. 
 I'll give you one. Beat -- then she nods, agreeing. She gestures. The little BOY sits. Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper, sharpens her charcoal... and... goes motionless. Studying the boy's face. He gazes back. Then -- inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and exaggerated. Then she fills in the shape of his head. His ears. His jaw. In a rush, his likeness appears. The parents come over to peek -- then gasp. Margaret is good. She sketches faster. Focused. Until a LOUD, PLUMMY VOICE drifts in... 
 MAN'S VOICE Monet? "Monet"?! Whew -- that's a hell of a compliment. Though, if I may respectfully disagree, I'm more in the tradition of Pissarro. Margaret looks up, distracted. She resumes her work. 
 MAN'S VOICE C'mon, get closer. Closer! Look at that sunlight coming through the mottled leaves. That's a bold yellow! Curious, Margaret casually peers over... 
 Holding court in another booth is WALTER KEANE, 40. Walter is astonishing: Hugely confident. Charming. Waggishly handsome. And dressed like an "Artist" -- striped turtleneck, with hands full of brushes. Walter's stall is filled with oils of Paris street scenes. He casually flirts with TWO YOUNG COEDS. They admire a painting. 
 You wanna touch it? Do it! I lay it on thick -- you're not gonna break it! 
 Excuse me, Ladies. 
 All finished. Her customers gape, impressed. She smiles. The guy counts out four quarters, then happily leaves. 
 You're better than spare change. You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap. 
 I'm just glad they liked it. 
 Ahhh! You're past that point! Your heart is in your work... He leans in, too close. Margaret shivers. Breathing faster. 
 What's your name? 
 M-Margaret... Mmm. He grins, checking her out... her loose sexy blouse and tight black capris. She flushes. 
 Wouldn't you rather flirt with those dolls over there? 
 Mm, no. 
 (BEAT) I like you, Margaret... He zeroes in on the artworks' signature: "M. Ulbrich" 
 "...Ulbrich." 
 Little Girl! How would you like your portrait sketched by the World- Renowned Margaret Ulbrich?! Queen of the Bay! In mere minutes, she will capture your soul! Hm. Jane shrugs, unimpressed. 
 Nah. 
 "Nah"?! (he grabs a PAINTING) Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting?? 
 But that IS me! And that's me... (she POINTS all over) And that one started as me, but then Mother turned it into a Chinese boy. Huh? Walter peers at Jane... then at Margaret. And then -- it hits him. He grimaces, embarrassed. 
 Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies, Honey. I misconstrued the situation. 
 (SHEEPISH) Well I'll just mosey along, before Mr. Ulbrich comes back and socks me in the eye. 
 A gut decision. She stares at Walter, then smiles slyly. 
 Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture...! 
 His face slowly lights up. Ah! Sun breaking through clouds. 
 Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't call first. Est-ce que tout va bien? 
'D Je vais bien, merci! Comment allez- vous? 
 Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful woman! Could life be any grander?? They get led in. Margaret is dazzled. Walter whispers. 
 And I don't even have to pay! I'm set because I gave the chef a painting. You know what he said? "Nobody paints Montmartre like Walter Keane!" 
 I can't believe you lived in Paris. 
 Best time of my life... 
 I've never even been on an airplane. 
 Well you have to experience these things! Grab 'em!! 
 (JOCUND) I wanted to be an artist, so I just went! Studied painting at the Beaux- Arts. Lived in a Left Bank studio. I survived on bread and wine... 
 You're a romantic. 
 Damn right! A wistful shrug. He chugs his glass. 
 Of course, walkin' away from the bourgeois scene wasn't a snap. I had to quit my job. Leave my wife. These choices aren't easy... She stares at her wine. 
 I've never acted freely. I was the daughter. The wife. The mother... 
 You shouldn't knock your work. I'd give an eyetooth to have your talent. Margaret is taken aback. He's absolutely sincere. 
 You can look into someone and capture them on canvas! You paint people! (he gestures sadly) I can only paint -- things. My street scenes are charming... but at the end of the day, it's just a collection of sidewalks and buildings. Walter goes silent. He has revealed his fears. 
 ANGLE - MARGARET She doesn't know what to say. Gently, she takes his hand. 
 Walter, I'd bet you could paint anything. 
 
 (INTENSE) Whew... Baby, when you look at me like that, I could fall hard. Margaret gulps. Afraid to talk. 
 This is moving fast. You're my first date in a long time... Neither of them speaks. The tension builds -- There is a spark between them... 
 Sweetie, could you stop fidgeting? 
 Mother, after all this time, you MUST know what my face looks like. Margaret winces. Walter laughs. She gets busy, penciling in LARGE OVAL EYES. Then -- quick marks for the mouth and nose. Impatient, Jane spies on Walter's canvas. 
 Hey! Your canvas is blank! 
 Er, you can't rush inspiration -- 
 Jane! Don't bother Mr. Keane. You know creativity has to well up from the inside... 
 Don't worry. She's not bothering me...! Walter leaves Jane. He points at Margaret's canvas. 
 There's something I gotta ask you. What's with the big crazy eyes...? 
 I believe things can be seen in eyes. They're the windows of the soul -- 
 Yeah, but, c'mon! You draw 'em like pancakes! I mean, they're WAY out of proportion! He's having fun, but she remains serious. 
 Eyes are how I express my emotions. That's how I've always drawn them. 
 (EARNEST) When I was little, I had surgery that left me deaf for a period. I couldn't hear, so I found myself staring... Relying on people's eyes... She smiles shyly. Understanding, he smiles back. Then -- 
 Walter? Hey -- Walt! Walter spins, startled. A FRIENDLY GUY in a suit strolls up. 
 I thought that was you! 
 
 Boy, I'm glad to see you! Have we heard back from the city, on that setback? My guys really need the variance, for the first floor retail. Walter is mortified. He turns away from Margaret. 
 Um... we should hear from Permits by Thursday. 
 Yeah? Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects! Pleased, the guy cheerily strides away. 
 What was that?? 
 
 I'm in commercial real estate. A stunned beat. 
 You're a -- Realtor? 
 
 (CONTRITE) YES! A hugely successful Realtor! Top earner in the Downtown office three years running! 
 And you're... ashamed? 
 Of course! Any blockhead can arrange a sublet! 
 (HEARTFELT) All I ever wanted was to support myself as an artist... 
 (SAD; BEAT) I tried to make a clean break, but couldn't cut it. I'm just a goddam Sunday painter. An amateur. Margaret looks at him, touched by his vulnerability. 
 A-hem! 
 She turns, startled. Feeling guilty, Margaret rushes from Walter. Busying herself, she skims through the MAIL. Jane shakes her head and marches out. Margaret flips through envelopes -- until one stops her. On edge, she slowly removes an official DOCUMENT. She scans it... and her face drops. Crushed. Something terrible... Walter is worried. 
 What's wrong...? 
 
 You're a perfect mother. 
 He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. It's beyond my abilities as a single woman... Margaret trails off, shaken. Walter gulps unsurely. Then, he takes her in his arms. We 
 Marry me. 
 
 (he puts a finger to her lips) Shh. Don't think of a reason to say no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons to say yes. (he gives a winning smile) I know it makes no sense! 
 WALTER (CONT'D) But just think of the fun we'll have..! And I'll take care of you girls. Margaret stammers, speechless. She doesn't know what to say. Walter pulls out his ace. In a debonair move, he creakily drops to his knee. He exudes a hammy, wonderful romance: 
 Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon, whatdya say? Let's get married! We can be in Hawaii by the weekend. 
 "Hawaii"? M-marriage? 
 
 (BEGUILING) Because you're a princess... and you deserve to get married in paradise. 
 CLOSEUP - MARGARET Margaret shudders, tears in her eyes. Hawaiian MUSIC begins... 
 You're right... this is paradise. Only God could make those colors. 
 I knew you'd love it. 
 Oh, can't we stay here forever?? 
 Well, I don't know about forever. But maybe... I can arrange another week. 
 This is a waterfall... the air was so fresh you could taste it. Here's an ancient altar... that statue is Kane, the god of creation. I said a prayer to him. Oh! Here's Walter and Janie, building a sandcastle -- Dee-Ann raises an eyebrow. 
 DEE-ANN This is all happening mighty quick. In the time you moved here, I've had two dates. You're already married. 
 
 (SHE GIGGLES) I thought there was a void in my life. Well... Walter's filled it. 
 DEE-ANN Walter's filled a lot of things. He's diddled every skirt on the art circuit. 
 You're talking about my husband! 
 DEE-ANN I know! That's why I brought it up. Margaret frowns, insulted. 
 I'm not naive. (beat; she laughs) Well, I am naive. But I know the man I'm marrying. Walter can act rash... but he's a good provider. And he's wonderful with Jane. 
 "You are on the threshold of untold success." 
 What's brilliant about the composition is its spontaneity. The image has no visual center of attention. 
 It's quite gestural. 
 Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by the tachistes. 
 I heard Tab Hunter was in here, looking at one. 
 Well... I'm not allowed to say... He NODS HIS HEAD up-and-down: Yes, you're right. 
 Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please don't come in here... The door SLAMS. Walter loudly barges in. 
 Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute? 
 Walter. In polite society, the word is "appointment." 
 (glancing back and forth) Uh, I could come back later... She anxiously hurries for the door. Ruben fumes. Walter ignores it all and starts laying out his wares. First, the Parisian street scenes, one after another... 
 You're gonna love my stuff today. 
 Haven't I seen that one before? 
 Nah! That was painted in the Fifth Arrondissement. This is the Sixth Arrondissement! 
 
 It's all up here. (beat; a sentimental 
 Well, it's not going up here. 
 (CRUEL) Walter, you know we don't go for that representational jazz! You're too literal. 
 
 (HURT) Hey, Art isn't fashion! 
 Yes it IS! 
 CLOSEUP - WALTER Ouch! This stings terribly. Walter glares at the man, then softly slides aside his works. Quietly, he pulls out Margaret's Big Eye paintings. 
 Would they want... this? 
 
 No... they're my wife's. Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. Canvas after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds. 
 Why are their eyes so big?! They're like big stale jellybeans. 
 
 (SNIDE) It's Expressionism. Surely you recognize it. 
 
 (LONG BEAT) Well -- I'm just glad you two found each other. 
 So... what do you say? Ruben looks up, amazed. Walter seems oblivious. 
 I say, NO! It's not art. 
 
 It's like the back of a magazine! "Draw the turtle! Send in a nickel and win the Big Contest!" 
 How dare you! Lots of people would like this. 
 Well, nobody who's walking through the door of this gallery! 
 (BEAT) Now please! Clear out this clutter, before the taste police arrives. Walter's jaw drops. 
 We'll never break in...! Because there's a CABAL. A secret society of gallery owners and critics, who get together for Sunday brunch in Sausalito, deciding what's "cool." 
 (BROODING) They're like Freemasons. No, worse! McCarthy, in his hearings: "That painter, I anoint. That painter, I banish to nowheresville!" Heartfelt, Margaret disagrees. 
 I think people buy art because it touches them -- 
 Heh! You're livin' in fairy land! People don't get to discover a thing. They buy art, because it's in the right place at the right time. O.s., MUSIC BUILDS. Muddled, Walter turns. He looks -- and then -- his eyes light up. He is getting an idea... 
 The band speeds to a climax, the percussion throbbing. Then, a final, crazed note. BAM!! The crowd APPLAUDS. The club's owner, ENRICO BANDUCCI, bounds on stage. Banducci is a theatrical, natty Italian guy with a skinny moustache and loud personality. He grabs a mike. 
 Give it up for Cal Tjader! That set was HUMMIN'! Al-aright, be sure to stick around for the one a.m. show! The house lights come up. Banducci hops down, greeting guests, making his way out -- when Walter glides up. 
 Hey, Banducci. I love the music tonight. It's a gas. 
 Oh. Thanks, thanks. 
 I'm Walter Keane. I'm a painter. 
 Really? Hm...! Maybe you're right. What color were you thinking? Huh? Walter holds his composure. 
 No -- I'm an artist. I used to be based on the Left Bank. But now I've relocated to the "States," and I'm looking for an... exhibition venue. Beat. Banducci frowns. 
 I like my club the way it is. Your stuff's so hot, go put it in a museum. 
 Okay! I respect that. You're a businessman, not a charity! So how 'bout if I, uh... rented your walls? Hm?! Banducci raises an eyebrow. 
 Yes! The paintings are available for public viewing daily, from 7 to 3! (an awkward beat) Er, no. 3 a.m. It's in a nightclub. (he hangs up) Maggie! It's promotion time! We gotta lay the racket! Margaret puts on a smock, a bit dumbfounded. Walter spatters some paint on his shirt. He grins, then holds up his brush and SIGNS the painting: "W. KEANE" Margaret forces a "cheese" smile, with her Waif. FLASH! The camera pops. 
 A The Keane paintings hang here. The only human in sight is Walter, forlorn at a card table. Brochures are stacked, and he wears a sailor coat with a dandyish ascot. The image is grim. Walter listens to the raucous mob. Until, THUMP! -- a sloshed MAN stumbles in. Walter brightens and stands. 
 Ah, beautiful! An art lover! Yes sir, how may I help you? 
 
 ANGLE - WALTER He grimaces... beaten. Walter drops his head on the table. Not noticing a DRUNK COUPLE stagger in. They pass a Waif, then halt -- taken. They lean in. Enthralled... concerned... 
 Look at that child. She's so sad. 
 Is she poor..? 
 She's forgotten! It just makes me want to cry. (she peers at the signature, then turns) Are you "Keane"? Walter lifts his head from the table. 
 Yeah. 
 Well you're a hell of a painter. Walter squints, confused, then beams. Joy! Happiness bursting like a little child. 
 Why, thank you...! Thank you so much! 
 Your work is very powerful. There's so much emotion in those eyes. OUCH! Walter's smile collapses. 
 Is something wrong? 
 
 (beat; he CHUCKLES) Oh, I get it...! The artist doesn't wanna part with his favorite piece... The man winks, then pulls out a WAD OF BILLS. Walter stares morosely. 
 Hello, Picasso! Nice crowd, eh? 
 
 (SOUR) You wouldn't know it from that broom closet you parked me in. 
 Hey, it's prime thoroughfare! People drink, they gotta relieve themselves. 
 
 It's INSULTING! When people see art, they shouldn't think of SHIT! 
 
 I've never posted bail before. Silence. He has no idea what to say. His aplomb crumbles. 
 I'm -- I'm sorry. Banducci... laughed at our work. ...So I socked him. 
 Since when are you thin-skinned? Artists have to handle criticism. 
 You're right! I know. But... I was already in a bad place. I'd had a couple... and earlier... 
 (PAUSE) I let some guy think I painted your Big Eye. Beat. Margaret is stupefied. 
 I don't understand. Why would you do such a thing?! 
 It was a misunderstanding. And then, I didn't want to jinx the sale. 
 Don't ever do it again. 
 Don't give me a hard time. I'm just grabbing my stuff... Across the packed room, he spots Banducci with a black eye. Walter halts, uncertain. A bristling tension... Until -- Banducci suddenly rushes and GRABS him! Walter flails, freaked. Banducci DRAGS him into a back kitchen -- 
 Can you believe this? We're sold out, and I don't even have a headliner!! 
 (GLEEFUL) Hell, it's a Monday! Walter blinks, lost. Banducci explains. 
 Dope, we made the front page!! People are here, cause they wanna see the sappy paintings that made grown men fight!! A moment of discombobulation... until -- Walter slowly grins. 
 I'll see you in COURT, you son of a bitch! I'm suing you for assault! Slander! False arrest!! Banducci storms away. Walter shudders, "upset." CUSTOMERS peer at him... then at the paintings. Curious, they migrate that way... 
 Yes sir! Whew. That was quite a load of horseshit you gents were layin' out there. 
 (LONG BEAT) Dick Nolan. The Examiner. Walter freezes up. Until -- Dick grins conspiratorially. 
 Hey pal, don't lose any sleep. I eat this stuff with a spoon! It gives me something to type about, in my column. 
 (he laughs, relieved) I thought you only did celebrities. 
 Well, Banducci's famous -- and you hit him! So you're a celebrity, once- removed. 
 Huh? Uh, sure -- Dick smoothly drags him to the bar. Dick waves the bartender. 
 Gary! I'll have a Ward Eight, in a frosted high boy. My friend'll have the same. (he beams, then turns) So! Walter, tell me about your work -- 
 Well, when I was in Paris... 
 Jesus, not those! I mean the little hobo kids. What?! Walter frowns, peeved. He considers this indignity... then decides to stomach it. He smiles fakely, effusively. 
 What do you wanna know...?! 
 Ding-a-ling! Wake up, we're a HIT! Margaret rolls over, groggy. Walter jumps on the bed, grinning. He tosses her a HANDFUL OF MONEY. 
 What a night! I sold out all your Big Eyes!! She rubs her eyes, amazed. 
 There must be two-hundred dollars... 
 They adore you! Cause of that article, the joint was PACKED. And then, a famous journalist showed up, and -- I need more paintings! Now! He hungrily KISSES her. She laughs. 
 Walter, they take at least a week. There's layering, shading -- 
 Of course! But, this is opportunity! Ah, we're gonna make a crackerjack team: Me schmoozing up the club, while you're back here, doing what you love! She stares at him -- then smiles. MUSIC... 
 Mrs. Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so late... but would you mind watching Jane? 
 ...yeah, eyes are powerful. A poet said they're the windows of the soul. Margaret smiles, touched. She comes closer.... 
 They hold so much feeling. 
 You got it! That's why I paint 'em so big. 
 (BEAT) I've always done it that way. 
 CLOSEUP - MARGARET She GASPS, stunned. The room starts spinning. 
 
 If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out. 
 ANGLE - MARGARET Her face goes ashen. Dizzy, she clutches for support. What to do?? Overcome, she shrinks away... disappearing... ending up alone in a corner. She cowers, childlike. 
 Walter...? He spins -- shocked at her presence. 
 Baby! 
 -- 
 Why are you lying? For once, Walter has no answer. She bores in, emotions racing. Confused. Hurt. 
 You're taking credit for something that isn't yours. He looks ill. Wheels spinning, looking for an out -- 
 I was... trying to close the deal -- 
 Those children are part of my being! 
 I'm just a salesman! You know, buyers pay more if they meet the painter -- 
 They couldn't meet me, because you told me to stay home!! 
 Shh, QUIET! He grabs her, pulling her behind a curtain. He's desperate. 
 Don't blow this! Look, we're makin' money! Your pocket, my pocket? What's the difference?! 
 
 Not all all! But it's not about ego! You wanna say you did the street scenes? Fine! I don't care! Say a monkey painted it! She breaks into tears, sobbing. 
 I'm glad you can dash off your pieces without any emotional connection...! 
 Ah, honey! I just wanna share them with the world! 
 (BEAT) Would you rather have your children piled in a closet... or hanging in someone's living room? Silence. Then -- FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! Walter turns. And -- his eyes pop, astonished. 
 Hey. Who is that remarkably handsome and confident man? 
 That's Dino Olivetti -- as in Olivetti typewriters. 
 BANDUCCI (CONT'D) Don't even try, Walter. He doesn't speak a lick of English. Walter stares hungrily. 
 ANGLE - OLIVETTI glides into the club -- a vision of perfection with his slick hair and sunglasses. He approaches closer, closer... when he gets distracted. By one of Margaret's Big Eye PAINTINGS. Walter gasps. He nudges Margaret. Olivetti peers at the artwork. Intrigued. Then -- excited. He starts gesturing and yapping in ITALIAN. The Blondes shout back. Everyone is getting worked-up. The big-bosomed Blonde turns to Walter. 
 Mr. Olivetti is enchanted with the painting. He would like to know... who is the artist? 
 I am! Walter swoops over and grabs Olivetti in a hearty clasp. 
 It's a delight to meet you, Signore! Buon giorno! Have you been an art lover for long..? We move in tight on MARGARET, as the SOUND DIALS DOWN. 
 WALTER'S VOICE I call that piece "The Waif." Isn't it striking? With its juxtaposition of girl, cat, and stairs... and its almost Flemish use of underpigment... The SOUND dims... then goes SILENT. Margaret stares in shock, unmoving. Time seems to stop. She is frozen in grief. Until -- 
 WALTER'S VOICE Baby! Baby! Can you believe it?!! 
 Time has passed. Walter happily clutches Margaret. 
 We made five grand!! Five THOUSAND dollars...!!! 
 (GIDDY) And that wasn't even one of your good ones! Margaret blinks, lost. In the b.g., Olivetti holds the painting, now wrapped-up in newspaper and twine. A pleased customer. Margaret's face darkens. 
 Don't you mean... one of your good ones? 
 No. No no! One of -- OUR good ones. (the spirit of generosity, he hands her a CHECK) Look at those zeroes! We've hit the big time! We are now hanging in the collection of Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti! With his patronage comes credibility! And with credibility comes RESPECT! Margaret stares at the check in her hands. At all the zeroes. 
 What about... honesty? 
 Aw c'mon! The paintings say "Keane"! I'm Keane, you're Keane. From now on, we are one and the same. Walter pulls her tight. She doesn't resist. 
 INSERT - NEWSPAPER We ZOOM into Dick Nolan's SOCIETY COLUMN. Under a caricature of Dick is a highlighted ITEM. We hear TYPING: 
 On behalf of the children of the world, we present this painting to Mayor Christopher! 
 In the interest of peace through culture, we donate this painting to the people of Russia! 
 The Purple Onion. 9:30. Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation. 
 Miss Crawford! In recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting, "The Lion and the Child"! 
 Joan said "Marvelous"! MARVELOUS! That's worth more than 1000 critics! (he CLAPS his hands) Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening. 
 But... isn't it strange? Artists get shown. They don't build their own galleries. 
 Says who?! Like John Q. Public cares? He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism! She responds -- but he sexily puts his finger to her mouth. 
 He digs real art. Your art! It's beautiful. You're beautiful... Walter starts rubbing against her, dancing sensually. She laughs, embarrassed, her wet paint brushes smearing his chest. She relents and relaxes. They dance around... 
 Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this! Little Jane tiredly glues another poster. She yawns. 
 I remember when Momma painted that. Huh? Suddenly, Margaret freezes. She hadn't anticipated this. Margaret looks to Walter. He stares back, waiting. 
 Are you -- sure? That was a long time ago. 
 Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen -- 
 
 No, Mother did! Look! I'm wearing my blue dress. 
 L-lots of girls have that dress... Margaret trails off, sickened. Not knowing how to lie. Walter takes charge. He kneels, then smiles gently at Jane. 
 You have a good eye, sweetie. I painted it, but I was trying to mimic your mother's style. You know, the style she USED to paint in. 
 CLOSEUP - JANE A loooooong pause. She examines the print. Then... she nods. 
 Well you did a really good job. 
 Hello. I've -- never really done this before. I'm not sure how you... 
 PRIEST'S VOICE No, no! Please. We don't chase people away. 
 (BEAT) What is troubling you? Margaret takes a breath. 
 I lied to my child. Pause. 
 PRIEST'S VOICE Why would you do that? 
 My husband... he pressured me into doing it. 
 (PAUSE) I've never lied to her before. I'm not that kind of person. Beat. 
 PRIEST'S VOICE Is your husband that kind of person? 
 Ummm, no. I don't think of him that way. I mean, he likes to tell stories... maybe he exaggerates a little... but he's a good man. 
 PRIEST'S VOICE But what of the child? Will this lie bring harm to her? 
 "Harm"?? Oh! Not at all. 
 (BEAT) I'm just looking for answers... The Priest considers this. 
 PRIEST'S VOICE Well, the modern world is a complicated place. 
 N-no. That's not what -- 
 PRIEST'S VOICE It sounds like your husband is trying to make the best of an imperfect situation. 
 (BEAT) You were raised Christian, so you know what we are taught: The man is head of the household. 
 (BEAT) Perhaps you should trust his judgment. 
 I think it's creepy, maudlin and amateurish. 
 Exactly. I love it. We move in tight on the painting. Underneath is a tag: "BEDTIME, by WALTER KEANE. Oil on canvas." We drift along, to another painting: "CALICO CAT, by WALTER KEANE." Then, another: "IN THE GARDEN, by WALTER KEANE." Every painting is now by Walter Keane. We move along... finding the Tipsy Man chatting up Dick. 
 We got in early. We own three. 
 DEE-ANN Hey, baby! Killer party! It's a hap- pen-ing...! So, where's your stuff? 
 
 DEE-ANN 
 Well... he's more established. 
 DEE-ANN Please! Is that you talking, or did you just turn into a little felt puppet with someone's hand up your ass? Margaret is befuddled. Dee-Ann scopes out the artwork. 
 DEE-ANN It's strange... Walter doesn't strike me as the cute hungry kitten type... Margaret grimaces. 
 Thanks for coming. Margaret grabs a drink and hurries away. Dee-Ann stands there, irked. Margaret cuts over to Walter. We MOVE IN TIGHT ON THE COUPLE. He grins and grabs her. 
 Ah, my sweet! Are you enjoying the scene? (he gives her a kiss) 
! 
 WALTER (CONT'D) Give a hand to my beautiful wife. Without her, none of tonight would be possible! The crowd APPLAUDS politely, condescendingly. Margaret smiles strangely. The Tipsy Man leans in. 
 Your husband's quite a talent. 
 (PLEASANT) Do you paint, too? Margaret freezes up, terribly awkward. 
 I don't... know. 
 A NOSY GUY corners him in front of a painted child. 
 I'm curious about your technique. How long did that piece take to execute? 
 That? Oh, wow. Probably... months. First the thinking, the sketching, and then time with just me and the oils. 
 "Oils"? But isn't that acrylic...? Huh? Walter glances at the painting, startled. 
 Oh --! You mean that painting! Uhh, sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas, rattling around in my brain! Beat. 
 So where do you get your ideas? 
 What do you mean? 
 I mean -- (confused at this confusion) Why are they... images of children? Yikes. Walter starts to sweat. He didn't think this through. 
 Well, er, I've just always loved kids. Though mostly I was influenced by my darling daughter... An odd beat. 
 I remember when she was a baby... Walter gets a far-off look. 
 Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd get out my Brownie and snap a photo... but... that's not subjective. You know? It doesn't capture your feelings. So that's when I started painting her... We hold on Walter, unsure where reality begins and ends... 
 Mom! I wanna come in. 
 (O.S.) Uhh, you can't. Mommy's busy. 
 (she BANGS again) Let me in! What are you doing in there? Why's the door always locked? 
 Janie, sweetie, you need to respect your mother's privacy. Sometimes grownups need alone time. 
 Whew! Out of this world...! 
 
 Ah, Jane's grand! She's eating ice cream! She has new shoes. She has a college fund. Beat. 
 Maybe I'm lightheaded from the turpentine. I've been in here all day. 
 Well I don't want you feeling like a prisoner. Take a break! Walter glances at one PAINTING -- then does a take. 
 ANGLE - PAINTING It's a child in a rusty alley, staring, aching for compassion. And, starting to cry. A single tear streams down her cheek. 
 Is that a tear...? You've gone deep! Margaret bites her fingers, worried. 
 Do you -- like it? 
 I love it! ...How'd you get the eyes so lifelike? Is it the highlights? 
 
 (PROUD) No. The secret is the shadow. I shadowed the eyelid. Margaret smiles shyly. Walter smiles back, full of warmth. He takes her face in his hands. 
 I owe you an apology. I was initially dismissive of your kids, those emotion- wrenching blobs of humanity... but they have a real strength. 
 
 I'm trying! Ah, you know me. See -- this is why I need your help! I want to go on tv, to defend our art. 
 You're going to be on television?! 
 Yes! But... what will I say?? 
 (BEAT) Meaning -- what compels me... to paint... these paintings?? A bizarre pause. The two of them look around the room. At all the Big Eyes peering down at them. 
 Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession with little girls. 
 Cute. 
 
 (SHE SNICKERS) I guess you've painted yourself into a corner. 
 Funny! Keep 'em coming! You're a regular Steve Allen. You want heat this winter? Help me out! 
 Walter... art is personal. Walter picks up a picture of TWO LITTLE GIRLS IN TUTUS. He stares, perplexed. 
 What would make a grown man paint a picture like this?! No answer. He thinks of stories, wheels spinning. 
 I grew up, surrounded by six sisters. 
 What about your Paris street scenes? Why do you paint those? 
 Well, because... I lived it! I experienced it! 
 (calling his bluff) And was it really all sun-dappled streets and flower vendors? Huh? Walter stares off at the Waifs. They peer out from broken windows... chain-link fences... And then -- he gets it. 
 Well -- NO! Of course not. It was after the War. There was destruction everywhere... 
 (PAUSE) 
 WALTER (CONT'D) I traveled the Continent. The ravages were horrifying... 
 Good afternoon! Delighted! (he reaches the SEXY BLONDE CLERK and pinches her ass) How many sales today? 
 "Sales?" None with this crowd. Walter's smile drops, surprised. 
 These people are looky-loos! They can't afford the paintings. But we gave away a heap of posters! Huh? Walter peers, baffled. Suddenly -- a loud FRWWIPPPP! Walter whirls, startled. Outside, two GIRLS tear a big poster off the front window. Walter's eyes widen. Slowly, he turns back. At the counter, FOLKS and KIDS are grabbing free posters from a box. Walter stares. Processing this. And then... being struck by an idea of absolute genius... 
 
 WALTER'S VOICE And then... we could sell it anywhere!! EVERYWHERE! 60's-style MADISON AVENUE GRAPHICS: A still of a HARDWARE STORE. Mops, light bulbs, then -- BING! -- framed KEANES. A PHARMACY. Aspirin, candy bars -- BING! -- framed KEANES. A GAS STATION. Tires, motor oil, and -- BING! -- KEANES. 
 Whew! Something smells in here. You should open a window. Margaret blinks, a bit dazed. 
 What time is it? 
 I dunno. 6:30, 7? ...Didn't Janie get dinner? Margaret shrugs. Walter leans in. 
 When's the last time you washed your hair? 
 I've been... busy. 
 (he notices the turned canvas; he's intrigued) What do you got back there? Lemme see. 
 No --! It's just... something I'm working on. It's not for the world. Walter gives her a funny look. 
 "The world"? Baby, it's me! (stepping forward, a bit 
) I'm your number one fan. 
 No, please! Walter, it's -- personal. 
 
 (GETTING CLOSER) But we're husband and wife. We shouldn't have secrets... Margaret gulps, fretting. Finally, without options -- she flips over the canvas of the lonely blonde. And -- Walter is taken aback. His eyebrows raise, shocked. Margaret bites her lip. Will he go ballistic? 
 ANGLE - WALTER He leans right up to the painting. His expression is inscrutable. Studying the technique. We have no idea what his emotion is. 
 It's a completely different style. 
 Yes it is. 
 
 (BEAT) It looks like you. 
 It's a self-portrait. Beat. 
 How am I gonna explain that? She shifts about. 
 I thought... maybe... I could sign it myself. Hmm. Walter's eyes narrow. 
 That seems a bit confusing. "Keane" means me. 
 Yes, I know... but... when people ask me if I paint, I don't know what to answer! I just want the pride of being able to say -- that's mine. Walter's wheels are ratcheting. 
 Who'd you tell about the Big Eyes? 
 Nobody! 
 
 (PARANOID) Was Dee-Ann here?! Did Dee-Ann see this painting?! 
 No! NOBODY saw it! 
 You tell anybody, the empire COLLAPSES! Do you wanna give back the money? We've committed FRAUD! 
 I KNOW! My God! I live with this every minute of my life! 
 Janie thinks I'm in here, painting. 
 C'mon! You haven't picked up a brush in months! (starting to sob) We used to paint together! Easels next to each other, side-by-side -- 
 That was the honeymoon period! Margaret breaks into tears. Walter tenses. 
 Jesus, you're so fragile. 
 I've kept my end of the bargain! I've never told! (she SOBS harder) Please! Just let me have this! Walter recoils, unable to take this. He relents. 
 So you're now called "The Painting Keanes"? 
 Yep! Walter and his girls! With galleries in three cities! 
 I had no idea Margaret painted. 
 Yeah, we don't talk about it. Sadly, people don't buy lady art. 
 
 The bar's over there. Dick goes to get a refill. Walter shoots Margaret a look. 
 Yeah, Margaret's a superb artist, in her own way. I even steal a few tips from her, now and then! 
 True true. So Margaret, where do you get your ideas? 
 (a bit tentative) Oh... from the world around me. And I love Modigliani's use of line. 
 ModiWHAT? The Italian joint? 
 Oh, for Christ's sake, Margaret! Dick writes a gossip column -- 
 (BEAT) Let's stick to the family angle. Get a gander at little Janie over there! Walter steers Dick to Jane, cute at her little child's easel. 
 What a talent! Look at these Keanes! If you cut open our veins, we bleed oil! Er -- turpentine. 
 (AWKWARD) Uh, Dick, you know what I'm goin' for. Make it sound good. DING-DONG! It's the doorbell. Everyone turns. 
 Who's that? 
 Ah! A little treat! The fourth member of the Painting Keanes! Margaret and Jane turn, confused. Walter whips open 
 Lily, honey, how are you?! He gives her a giant hug. She responds stiffly -- a girl who doesn't see her father too often. 
 Really? Did you get in a fight? 
 Well is the tooth fairy somethin' I gotta deal with, or did your mother already handle it? 
 (DRY) She handled it. 
 Good! Good good! Well, just go throw your stuff in the kids' room, then you can come join the fun! Lily toddles out. 
 Walter... you never told me you had another daughter. 
 Didn't I? Sure. Lil's from my first marriage. Margaret struggles to hold her rage. Disoriented... 
 Walter? 
 (URGENT) Walter! We need to speak. Margaret gestures: Get in the kitchen! He nods and follows. 
 What is going on here??! 
 That's Lily. I'm sure I mentioned her -- 
 No you didn't. 
 Did she just move in?? 
 No! Her mom's just going to Vegas for the weekend. 
 (BEAT) I'm supposed to have her once a month, but I don't make her mom enforce it. 
 How can you keep something so big a secret??? 
 She's a sweet girl. 
 
 I put up with your daughter. I never said a peep. Margaret's jaw drops. 
 I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. 
 I'm sorry. Sorry! Please... let's just try to get through this. 
 Take the bed. I can sleep on the 
 -- 
 Do you live far away? 
 
 But you never see Walter? 
 
 Does he talk about me? 
 
 Yeah, mine's the same. 
 (BEAT) Except she drives a Packard. Lily nods. Jane lowers her voice naughtily. 
 I have some peanut butter hidden in my sock drawer. Do you wanna eat it? Lily smiles: Sure. Jane opens a drawer and removes a jar of Skippy. The two girls sit on the floor, happily eating the peanut butter with their fingers. 
 Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a lot in common. They both walked away from successful careers to travel the globe, live on a boat... We move... finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX. It displays a few of her sad blondes, alongside Jane and Lily's paintings of flowers and Mr. Potato-Head. Margaret sits, seeming like an adult at the children's table. An urbane RICH MAN glides by... and is taken with one of Margaret's nubile blondes. He gazes at the lounging figure. Margaret sits up. Alert, pleased with his interest. She tingles. Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in: 
 I painted it! 
 Really? 
 "MDH"? You're so... mysterioso. 
 Yes, we don't use my name, since people don't take women's art seriously. 
 (BEAT) "MDH" are my initials. And more! I'm interested in numerology... and as you know, seven is a very good number. 
 
 Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret Doris Hawkins! "M" is the 13th letter of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals 16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven! The man's head is spinning. He's lost all interest. Across the room, Walter sees this debacle. He marches over. 
 Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second? (he PULLS HER ASIDE) Good grief! What the hell are you babbling about?! Long division?? Could you please help the world and shut your mouth? You want just one number in his head: The sales price! Her face drops, hurt. Acquiescing. 
 #1 Two nuts that fell from the same tree! It's insufferable. Why are we starving, while they print money? 
 #2 Because that nut's a genius! He sells paintings! Then he sells pictures of the paintings! Then he sells postcards of pictures of the paintings. 
 #1 I'll bet I could bang one out in ten minutes. 
 #2 It wouldn't have the dopey sincerity. 
 #1 The customers won't notice... They peer sheepishly at each other... 
 Christ. It's a movement. 
 (V.O.) It's "The Tonight Show!" With guests Jerry Lewis, the Everly Brothers, artists Walter and Margaret Keane -- The CHANNEL CHANGES: A children's toy commercial (STOCK). A tear-streaked, crying plastic DOLL, a flagrant Waif rip-off: 
 (V.O.) She's "Little Miss No Name," the doll with the tear. From Hasbro. The CHANNEL CHANGES: Spanish TELEVISION. A Keane painting gets hung in Madrid's National Museum of Contemporary Art. 
 Rembrandt, shush! In the foyer, Margaret opens the front door. And standing there is Dee-Ann. Dazzled. She laughs with surprise. 
 DEE-ANN My God! I thought I misread the address. 
 Yeah. That driveway is long. (she giggles, embarrassed) Honestly, I can't believe I live here. Dee-Ann glides in -- then freezes, agape. 
 DEE-ANN Whoa. 
 I know! Two acres, a pool, five 
 -- 
 (PAUSE) Though I thought that was excessive, since there's only three of us here. 
 DEE-ANN Three? I thought there were four. 
 What? 
 (CONFUSED; BEAT) Oh -- you mean Lily! No, she doesn't really live with us. That was just in the articles. 
 DEE-ANN Crazy. A fake daughter... Dee-Ann's eyes take it all in. Astonished. 
 DEE-ANN It's been so long since I've seen you. 
 I know. North Beach is 30 miles, but it might as well be 300... 
 DEE-ANN You're probably busy, hanging out with your new rich buddies. 
 (BARBED) "Kim Novak." 
 Oh, please! She's Walter's friend. (a quiet shrug) He brings people by... the Beach Boys were here. But, it's pretty isolated. Dee-Ann goes silent. Margaret seems dwarfed by the house. 
 Jane has nice friends. Sometimes I pick them up at the junior high, and we all get pizza. 
 (AWKWARD) But she's busy... Are you hungry? 
 DEE-ANN I'm thirsty. 
 Good! I'll whip us up two gin fizzes. Margaret forces a smile and scurries behind a giant curved wet bar. She pulls out ingredients: Gin, lemon juice, soda... 
 When we moved in, I thought a wet bar was extravagant... but it's surprising how much use you can get out of it. Dee-Ann watches the drinkmaking. 
 DEE-ANN How's Walter? 
 He couldn't be happier. He has everything he ever dreamed of. 
 DEE-ANN And so do you! Fabulous. Dee-Ann smiles archly. She glances away -- and notices Margaret's STUDIO, the door half-open. 
 DEE-ANN Oh, is that your studio? Margaret turns -- and gasps. 
 No --! You can't go in -- 
 DEE-ANN I just want a peek. See what the workspace of a wildly successful artist looks like -- 
 Dee-Ann, please! STOP -- Margaret rushes to block her -- but Dee-Ann pushes open the door, revealing... 
 W-Walter paints in here too. Hmm. Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. Then, her gaze settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on. Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint. Margaret sucks in her breath. Dee-Ann sees this. 
 DEE-ANN Is Walter home?? Margaret has no answer. The two friends look at each other... Dee-Ann waiting... wondering if Margaret is going to lie to her... 
 What the hell's going on here?!! 
 
 (TIMID) Uh... Dee-Ann was just... she... Margaret trails off. Walter thinks, then SNAPS. 
 You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done! Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet brush and quickly starts to "finish" the painting. Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face. He eyeballs the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do. A furtive glance. Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush and slaps a little black onto the shaded background. Walter spins, victorious. 
 There! 
 You and your whole non-representational crowd are FRAUDS!! 
 DEE-ANN SHUT UP! You're so full of shit, Walter! 
 Get outta my house! My big house! 
 (LIVID) Go back to sellin' your coat hanger sculptures on Fisherman's Wharf! 
 DEE-ANN Fuck you! Dee-Ann staggers outside, then hops in her car. 
 I don't want her ever invited here again. Margaret nods, terribly sad. 
 I won't. 
 Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball! She tumbles, and Rembrandt licks her ear. She giggles. 
 Okay, honey. I have to go work. 
 Can I come? (an awkward silence) No. I can never come. No! I shouldn't even ask. Jane glares glumly. Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter... then goes inside. 
 Where did you appear from? Didn't you hear? No visitors! Rembrandt wags his tail, his little eyes bright. Margaret peers. 
 Is this what it's come to? You're the only living soul I can tell my secret? (she lowers her voice) Well -- I painted them all! (she shudders with release) It's TRUE! I did every single one -- She gestures, then catches sight of a Walter street scene. 
 Well, every one except that street scene. 
 (BEAT) But I did the rest. Every Big Eye! And nobody will ever know. But YOU. Rembrandt pants and BARKS. Margaret chuckles, then goes to work. She pulls a CURTAIN across the sliding glass door. At her easel, she squirts a tube into a well and starts mixing colors. Rembrandt jumps on the couch. 
 No you don't! It's nice to have company, but that sofa is new. (she pushes him off) Let's find you some carpet to lay on. 
 I think there's a scrap back here... She rummages, sliding the junk aside. In back is a TATTERED 
. Hm? 
 Well what's this? Margaret swings the bulb closer. The crate is covered with SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS and international markings. Margaret's interest is piqued. She tugs at the lid, pulling it off. Revealing inside a STACK OF STREET SCENE PAINTINGS. Ten or fifteen of Walter's canvases. Or so it seems. 
 CLOSEUP - MARGARET She trembles, overcome. Music SWELLS. Her eyes spin back -- 
 M-Maggie! What're you doin' up? Margaret glares. Not speaking. He shrugs. 
 I had a helluva night. Worked three or four clubs. (he winks, loosey-goosey) Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town! Straight from Taipei! I think we should present her with a painting -- get Dick to flack it... 
 Maybe you should give her one of your street scenes. 
 
 (HAZY) You think? I dunno -- I thought you could whip off a doodle of Chinatown. With a cute little kid, sort of a big- eyed slanty-eyed thing... Margaret's anger is raging. She glares, steely. 
 No, Walter. She's a dignitary. Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes straight from you? 
 Yeah? Maybe you're right. She probably doesn't have a Parisian street scene hanging in her palace. Margaret nods, as if they've settled something. She turns to walk away -- then suddenly SPINS. 
 Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already has a Cenic. 
 He freezes up. Suddenly sober, smacked to reality. 
 "Cenic"...? Uh, what's that? Margaret stares, eyes sharp. 
 Cenic is the name of the artist who did all your early paintings. 
 Huhhh? (spinning his lie) Urgh... oh! CENIC! (he laughs crazily) Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All my art school pals loved my scenic views, so they called me "Scenic"! But since those Frogs can't pronounce a hard "e," I became "Cenic." He looks up at her hopefully. But she shakes her head. 
 The more you lie, the smaller you seem. 
 (unyielding, scrambling) How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm proud of my early Cenics! 
 Then why do you paint over the name? Walter gasps, floored. Margaret bores in. 
 A bit of advice: Don't use a water- base over an oil. It flecks off. Walter cowers. 
 You sound crazy! For God's sake. You've... you've SEEN me paint!!!! 
 No, I haven't. 
 CLOSEUP - WALTER All life drains from his face. His eyes go glazed. He speaks mechanically. Tiredly... 
 I studied art in Paris. I went to school at the Beaux-Arts. The Grand Chaumiere. I spent hours in the Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the Masters... 
 Walter? He turns. She winces, pained. 
 Have you even been to Paris? Walter blanches. He shakes, broken up. He looks away, then staggers to a chair. He falls into it. Trembling. Not able to look her in the eye... 
 I wanted... I so wanted to be an artist. But -- it just never turned out good. Margaret stares, seething. Then, without comment, she storms away. She SLAMS the door shut. BANG! Walter doesn't move. 
 I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. I -- I can't keep living these lies. 
 What are you working on? 
 A new MDH. Something for me. It's about a woman trapped in an uncaring world. I call it, "Escape." Walter bites his lip, afraid to talk. 
 I figured out a solution to our problems. 
 What? 
 Teach me. 
 (BEAT) Show me your tricks. Then you can pass off the Waifs, and we won't be lying anymore. She looks up in disbelief. 
 And then -- YOU'LL paint them? 
 Sure! Why not? 
 
 Y-you're right! 
 (SHEEPISH) But you know me! I'm a quick study. And I've got the basics... He trails off, unsure where this is going. Trying to rouse her, Walter rushes to an easel and throws up a blank canvas. She eyeballs him. 
 If you knew the basics, you wouldn't be at the easel. You have to sketch it first! Walter tightens, feeling stupid. He lets go of the canvas. Margaret stares, deciding. Then, she tosses him a PAD. Walter catches it. Slowly, he crosses over... 
 So...? What's first? 
 I dunno. You tell me. You're the creator. He frowns. 
 It's a -- Keane. 
 Oh, a Keane! How witty. 
 YEAH YEAH! Point taken. I'm standing here naked and humiliated in front of you. Look... can we just do a crying child? She gazes at him. Fingering her pencil... Trying to jump-start things, he starts to draw a circle -- 
 How old is the subject? 
 Huh? C'mon, it's a head -- 
 It matters! A young child's head is round. An older child's head is oval! He feels pressured. Hand shaking, he draws a crooked circle. 
 The child is this old! 
 NO I'M NOT! Every line is a decision! 
 (O.S.) Walter!! Huh? He lurches, startled. 
 -- Then -- he SCREAMS and smashes her CANVAS. BAM!!! The painting RIPS apart. Walter KICKS his foot through the remains, then spins and charges from the room. 
 How's SALES? 
 Oh, you know. Mondays -- Walter MUTTERS strangely. He snatches some paper and starts scribbling. Then he runs into the 
 Walter agitatedly paces, circling the stacks of PRINTS. 
 How many posters are back here? 
 Exactly? I dunno, 3,000 or -- 
 Does the printer owe us more? Do we owe him?? 
 Uh, let me -- 
 What about the OILS?! Are there more at the warehouse? 
 Mr. Keane, I'd have to make a -- 
 For the LOVE OF MUD! What am I PAYING you for? The girl freezes, rattled. Walter spins, flipping out. 
 Hypothetical question: If you were a man, would you marry Kim Novak or my wife? What? 
 Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up?? 
 
 What's it all mean? Why are we put on this earth? A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed...? 
 
 It's not even mine! It's one of hers. Aching, he staggers off. Sweating, woozy, he sits at a table. Distracted, he glances down at a newspaper... 
 INSERT - NEWSPAPER There's an article on the 1964 NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR. A headline says "CONSTRUCTION RACES TOWARD APRIL OPENING" 
'D Ah! Monsieur and Madame Keane! Delighted! Always such an honor! ANGLE on the Keanes. They are sullen. At wit's end. 
 This doesn't change anything. 
 (trying to hold her ground) I know the truth. 
 Who cares?! This is all your fault! Maybe it's time to shake things up. Start puttin' my name on the MDH's. Margaret is astonished. A fury crosses her face. 
 NO! Absolutely NOT!! I still hate myself for giving you the Waifs! 
 Quiet! Lower your voice -- 
 Oh, I'll talk as LOUD AS I WANT -- 
 NO YOU WON'T! Or -- 
 What??! 
 If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I -- I know people. Remember Banducci's cousin? The liquor wholesaler? Pause. Margaret breaks into tears. 
 You're threatening me...?! Fine, kill me! My God, I've kept our secret for years! I've never once -- 
 Christ, wipe your face! You look a mess. 
 (BEAT) It's life imitating art! A crying Keane! He hands her his handkerchief. She dabs at her eyes. A looming quiet. 
 What do you want, Walter? Everything with you is calculated. We're back where we had our first date... Walter's eyes widen. We MOVE IN TIGHT on them. He drops his voice. Dead serious. 
 Look, I don't deny I need you. You're the one with the gift. 
 (BEAT; HUSHED) Right now there's a shot... God, I'm shaking I'm so excited. The New York World's Fair. 70 million visitors. Opening day, I unveil my MASTERPIECE! She is flummoxed. 
 What masterpiece? 
 Exactly! What have I been missing all this time?! Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa... Renoir has his Boatmen's Lunch... but where's my defining statement? 
 You sound insane. Artists don't announce a masterpiece -- 
 Why not?! Didn't Michelangelo know he was hittin' a homer, when he was on his back painting the Sistine Chapel? 
 He worked on that for FOUR YEARS! 
 Posterity, baby...!! She empties her drink. 
 And here's the best part. It's for Unicef! Unicef is sponsoring the Hall of Education. Aw, we can finally give back to the children of the world!! Margaret stares, wavering... 
 It's too big. Why'd you promise them Cinerama size? 
 Because it has to encompass all children. All races! One hundred stricken faces! Marching to infinity! The ultimate Walter Keane! 
 (BEAT) At least that's what I told Life Magazine. Margaret ignores this. Walter does a rehearsed turn. 
 Oh, a publisher says it's good timing to put out a coffee table book. You know, classy: "Tomorrow's Masters." 
 You're right! Where are your preliminary sketches?? All that time in art school, and somehow we waylaid your youthful experiments! The half- finished charcoals, the struggles... 
 (a bit off-balance) I know you're being sarcastic, but these are all good ideas. Berlin war orphans... early self-portraits... 
 Get out of here. I'm trying to work. She brusquely spins away, back to the canvas. He shoots her an uncertain, dirty look. What just happened? 
 Mom, what's for dinner? 
 (NO RESPONSE) Mom! Are you home...? Nothing. No sign of Margaret. Jane tries the door of the PAINTING ROOM. As always, it's locked. Hm... Jane sneakily glances around. Opportunity. Quickly, she stands on a chair and reaches above the door sill. She feels around... and finds a KEY. Ah! Hurriedly, Jane UNLOCKS the door and lets herself in. 
 W-what are you doing in here --? 
 Mom... I know. 
 Jane, you don't know anything!! Jane's face tightens. Insulted. 
 I'm not a child anymore. 
 Four... five... SIX pages! Is there something here I'm missing? 
 (UPSET) He's like -- the Hula-Hoop! He just won't go away...! He flips a page -- then his jaw drops. 
 "Will be unveiled in the Grand Pavilion of the Hall of Education... internationally celebrated artist has been selected... will represent the aspirations of children worldwide --" 
 And WHO was on the selection committee? 
 Oh! Well there wasn't a "committee," per se. We just had a luncheon with me, Ed, Jerome, Jerome's wife... 
 Stop. Let us appreciate this moment. This is what we've worked toward our whole lives: Rarified air. Inside this house are the movers and shakers. Kennedys. Rockefellers. 
 (MISTY-EYED) Until today, we've always been on the outside, looking in. But when we enter... we will belong. 
 I was happier selling paintings in the park. He gapes, appalled. 
 You are one crazy bitch. Walter spins and grandly enters. He grabs two CHAMPAGNES from a server. 
 So maybe you have problems with the choices we made... but -- c'mon! Wednesday, the World's Fair opens. Thursday, our book goes on sale! 
 Friday, I file for divorce. 
 Aw, why are you always so miserable? 
 Mrs. Teasdale! Walter Keane. I just want to thank you for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree. Walter takes the woman's hand. She smiles stiffly, silently horrified. She glances around for help. She catches a SOCIETY MAN's eye, and he hurries over. 
 Hey, Keane. Have you seen the Times? 
 Er, no. Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely -- 
 I think you should read the Times. The Man gestures. Perplexed, the Keanes follow him into a 
 INSERT - REVIEW A BLIZZARD of WORDS assaults us: 
 "GROTESQUE" "APPALLING" 
 "TASTELESS" "Lowest common denominator" 
 How could anyone... say something so cruel? 
 (a seething fury) What do YOU care?! That's MY name being dragged through the mud! Walter CRUSHES the newspaper. He spins on the guy. 
 Is he here? 
 Er... yes. Which is perhaps why it would be best for everybody if you -- Walter STORMS out. The guy futilely chases -- 
 
 Mr. Keane, this is not the venue. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to the editor. Walter's throat tightens. He steps right into the guy's face. Women GASP. Tension bristles -- like a fight's about to erupt. 
 What are you afraid of?? 
 (MALEVOLENT) Just because people like my work, that means it's automatically bad?? 
 No. But that doesn't make it art either. Walter shudders. Canaday asserts himself. 
 Art should elevate -- not pander! Particularly in a Hall of Education! 
 
 WALTER (CONT'D) Why does a man become a critic --?? Because he can't create! You don't -- 
 Ugh! That moldy chestnut -- 
 Don't interrupt! You don't know what it's like! To put your emotions out there, naked, for the world to see. 
 What emotions?! It's synthetic hack work! (he loses it) Your "masterpiece" has an infinity of Keanes -- which just makes it an infinity of kitsch! Crazed, Walter grabs a FORK off the buffet. He lunges, like he's about to STAB Canaday! 
 looks around -- then quivers, realizing he's out of control. Shamed, he slowly drops the fork. People breathe a sigh of relief. 
 is mortified. This is all too awful. Silent, she watches Walter back out of the party... 
 What's wrong with lowest common denominators?! That's what this country was built on!! He KNOCKS over a lamp. Crash! 
 I'm gonna sue EVERYBODY! I'll sue that pansy critic! And the World's Fair! And -- Unicef! 
 But I can't sue you, can I? (in Margaret's face) You were the ultimate betrayal! You FAILED me with that painting! Suddenly, he pulls out a BOOK OF MATCHES. He lights a MATCH and waves it sinisterly -- 
 You crossed over from sentimentality to KITSCH! He THROWS the match at them. 
 Ow! 
 
 You like making me look bad?? You enjoy people laughing at me??! He PUNCHES the wall, then tosses the match. Fwoosh! 
 Walter! He throws ANOTHER MATCH. 
 
 Lemme in, you BITCHES!! 
 Ow! 
 Mom, what are we gonna do??! Margaret thinks. 
 You got all that paint and turpentine in there? Well I'm gonna burn you up! He pushes the lit match through the KEYHOLE. 
 You're gonna blow like an atom bomb! 
 We're leaving. Determined, Margaret runs to the curtained wall. She whips it aside -- revealing the sliding glass doors. 
 I'm sorry I wasn't the mother I could have been. I -- I should have done this years ago... 
 But where are we going? 
 (FLUMMOXED) We don't even have any clothes! 
 Where we're going, we won't need much. 
 (LONG PAUSE) Hawaii. Jane freezes, not sure whether to believe. 
 Really...? Margaret smiles softly. We slowly PUSH IN to her. 
 Yes, Hawaii. Because it's paradise. There's flowers, and birds, and beautiful colors. 
 (GENTLE) And... we're going to make a new life for ourselves. 
 Hello? 
 (O.S.) Maggie --? She freezes. 
 Boy, you were sure hard to track down. Thought I might never find you... (a menacing chuckle) I'm a little agitated. I got the strangest papers in the mail today. Margaret tries to stay cool. 
 It's a decree of legal separation. I would appreciate if you signed it. 
 Aren't you acting too rash? 
 Walter, our marriage is over. 
 Granted, our romance may have seen its better days. The bloom is off the rose. 
 (BEAT) But I'm looking out for both of us. What about Keane Incorporated?! We're a professional couple. Like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. 
 Walter, I want a divorce. 
 Whew. It hurts to hear you say those words. Silence. He is feigning "hurt feelings." Struggling for a response. Finally, his thoughts sharpen up, smart and shrewd. 
 I sure hate that it's come to this. 
 (BEAT) Well... I SUPPOSE I can agree to a split -- as long... as you assign me all rights to every painting ever produced. 
 If that's the price. 
 Really?! 
 Uh -- okay. And... then, we have to consider future revenue stream. 
 My God, Walter! How much more money do you need? 
 It's -- the marketplace! I gotta stay fresh. Surely you understand? 
 Would you like to go into town? I'm stopping by the post office. 
 No, I'm gonna surf with the gang. Margaret tightens up. 
 Your friends are a bit... wild. 
 
 Y-you know I can't have people over to the house. 
 That's right! Or they'd see the precious paintings!! 
 #1 Hello. We're visiting everyone in this neighborhood with an important message. No doubt you're busy, so we'll be brief. Huh? Margaret stares at them deadpan, highball in her hand. 
 #2 We have something to share with you about the wonderful things that God's Kingdom will do for mankind. Margaret's face darkens. 
 I'm not interested. She starts to close the door... but they continue. 
 #1 Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or in religion in general? 
 I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. The lady glances at Margaret's glass. She smiles gently. 
 #2 But we're not selling anything. We're just here to share the good news. 
 
 (DOUR) From where I'm standing, I don't see much good anywhere. Just a lot of pride, and thievery, and people treating each other poorly. 
 #2 Yes! Exactly! That is the good news! What? Margaret is lost. The ladies grab the opening. 
 #1 Bad things in the world are a sign. They show us that earthly Paradise is at hand. 
 #2 Do you know what it says in Timothy 
 Sounds like my ex-husband. Margaret laughs. Surprised, the women laugh, too. Margaret peers at them. At their Bible. 
 Would you like to come in? 
 It's been so long since I've been happy. But, I don't even know why I'm telling you... two complete strangers. 
 #1 It's our mission to comfort those in mourning. Jehovah wants us to help the brokenhearted. 
 So you're -- Jehovah's Witnesses? 
 I've explored so many religions. But they all had their flaws... 
 #2 Then they're wrong for you. Read your Bible -- you might be surprised by the answers it gives. 
 (GENTLE) Margaret, you can't go down a path unless you know, in your heart, it's the right one. 
 And how do you know...? 
 #2 
 What does that mean, exactly? 
 #2 
 It says here a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things. Jane snorts. 
 I just can't believe you let people in the house. 
 I have nothing to hide! 
 (TORRID) It also says no lies. "Speak truth. Let the stealer steal no more." Margaret and Jane lock eyes. 
 Shit, this is crazy! All these copies... you're like Warhol! 
 Nah, Warhol's like me. That fruitfly stole my act! "The Factory"? I had a factory before he had a soup can! The girls scrunch their faces, lost. Then -- DING-DONG! Walter peeks out the window, then grins. 
 Ah! It's my art supplies. 
 
! 
 JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES "Tremble not before your foe, Let all lovers of truth know! That my reigning Son, Christ Jesus, From the heav'ns has cast the foe. Soon will bind the Devil, Satan, Letting all his victims go!" Margaret and Jane are singing happily. 
 No... Big Lolo. Everything you just said is false. Margaret takes a deep breath. Working up her courage. 
 One: Walter is no longer my husband. (a long pause) And Two: He's not... a painter. Margaret exhales. The D.J. is confused. He checks his notes. 
 No. Though he's been taking credit for ten years. 
 You have got to be kidding! 
 DEE-ANN I knew it!!! 
 Who would WANT credit?! 
 Holy mother of GOD! Walter JERKS UP -- feral -- like an animal sensing danger. He whirls and looks around. Paranoia ratcheting. Is everybody staring at him? Walter starts shaking in horror. Then -- he jumps and BOLTS OUT. 
 Margaret's gone berserk! You gotta help me! I need a story, a wire story -- national! -- to calm things down. Dick peers shrewdly. 
 I don't know... Walter. What she has said is pretty inflammatory. 
 But it's nuts! It doesn't even make sense. When I was studying art at the Beaux Arts in Paris, she was still a kid in Tennessee! Dick reacts. Walter whips out the "Tomorrow's Master's" BOOK. 
 Look! These are my early sketches. (he flips pages, like a 
) See?! Berlin orphans, 1946! 
 
 Exactly! It's impossible! We didn't meet for another nine years! After she busted her first marriage. 
 I-I, but... why would Maggie do this? 
 She's unhinged! She left me and moved into the jungle. She fell in with a bunch of religious zealots: 
 I really don't know much about them... 
 Oh! These people are gone! Solid gone! They don't celebrate Christmas, they can't salute the flag... they won't even let Janie go to the prom! Dick is startled. 
 He made me sound crazy!! 
 #2 Just rise above it. 
 But how can I?! He claims I copied HIM! That he taught ME how to paint! (reading the NEWSPAPER) "She used a slide projector to trace my work and fill in the colors." 
 #1 And which part of that is untrue? 
 
 Hey. Is Jehovah okay with suing?? 
 #1 Seventeen million dollars! 
 (BEAT) The art world is abuzz! Is it possible that the decade's top-selling painter can't even paint??! 
 #2 Or is Mrs. Keane simply a bitter ex- wife, trying to steal her husband's fame and fortune? 
 (BEAT) Today in Federal Court, lawyers present their opening arguments in the case of Margaret Keane vs. Walter Keane and Gannett Newspapers. A trial that could produce the largest libel and slander award in Hawaiian history. Margaret, Jane, Margaret's LAWYER, and her FRIENDS walk up. Margaret glances over -- and spots FEMINIST SUPPORTERS smiling at her. They hold up signs: "Stand Up and Be Counted!" Margaret is bewildered. She hurries in. 
 #1 Mr. Keane! Are you at all concerned about the charges? 
 I'm angry as hell! But I'm lucky to have the mighty Gannett News Company watching my back. I expect to have this whole trial dismissed by noon. 
 (BEAT) Truthfully, my only concern is that somebody get this woman some psychiatric care. She needs it! 
 Margaret Keane is a public figure. And as such, she has to prove that our newspapers published statements, aware of probable falsity. 
 (BEAT) But there is no evidence that our editors could have known that the assertions were untrue. 
 (BEAT) We would like to submit 692 articles and interviews in which Mrs. Keane credits Mr. Keane as the painter of the so-called "big eye" children. His Associate hands two massive bound PILES OF NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES to the BAILIFF. Margaret winces. Walter grins, eating it up. The Judge stares sourly at the piles. 
 How many years back do these go? 
 Mrs. Keane has been making these statements since 1958. Beat. 
 This is a very strange case. These paintings hang in museums all over the world, attributed to Mr. Keane. And regardless of the truth, Mrs. Keane has contributed immeasurably to the confusion... The Judge stares off... then makes a decision. 
 It seems impossible that Gannett's actions would ever meet the legal standard for libel. So -- the charge against them is dismissed. 
 Thank you, Your Honor! 
 Good luck, Keane. 
 "Good luck"? W-where the hell are you going?! 
 We were charged with libel. You're charged with slander. 
 (BLASE) Just dance your way out of it. The Lawyers file out, leaving Walter alone at the table. He looks very small and pale. The Judge peers quizzically. 
 Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? Walter glances over at Margaret. She stifles a laugh. He glares daggers. Then, cocksure, foolhardy, he jumps to his feet. 
 I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name! 
 (BEAT) Let's PROCEED! 
" 
?" 
 (V.O.) I'm concerned about my old pal Walter Keane. The Hawaiian heat may have cooked his brain! The only thing he knows about courtrooms and lawyers comes from watching Perry Mason on television! 
 I'm the sole creator of my art. This is my total life. My contribution to the world -- 
 Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time. 
 Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor. 
 (BEAT) It's hard to keep this all straight... Walter gathers his thoughts -- then turns to the WITNESS STAND. Sitting in it... is Margaret. 
 Mrs. Keane. It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story -- 
 
 MR. KEANE!! Walter grimaces. He tries again, choosing his words. 
 Mrs. Keane. You seem like a lucid woman. Reasonably intelligent... So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme? 
 I was forced into it. You had -- She stops, bothered by this awkwardness. She looks away from Walter, to the Jury instead. 
 He had me dominated. He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. I was afraid. I didn't see any option, so I went along. I felt very bad... 
 (like a TV lawyer) I want to remind you you are under oath. The Judge SLAMS his fists down, enraged. Walter jumps. 
 S-sorry. Margaret turns back to the Jury. 
 I just gave in. I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. They reflected all my feelings... and... it was like losing a child... 
 Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. One a sadistic ogre... and the other a delightful bon vivant. Margaret stares him in the eyes. 
 That's you, Walter. Jekyll and Hyde. 
 What an outrageous statement! I demand we strike that from the record! 
 (he SLAMS his fist) Overruled!! 
 (she loses her temper) No! You're outrageous! Constantly criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying I'd be "knocked off" if I ever told the truth!! The Jury GASPS. Walter throws out his hands. 
 Your HONOR! I ask for a mistrial! Both Keanes starts QUARRELING. The Judge STANDS. 
 HEY! This is not a domestic squabble! Or -- maybe it is. But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it. Walter calms himself, contrite. 
 I'm sorry for the emotions. I'm an artist. The Judge stares harshly. 
 Maybe. 
 I call as my witness... Mr. Walter Stanley Keane! A strange beat. The Jurors glance at each other. Walter reacts, like he just heard his name. He strides jauntily over to the witness stand. The BAILIFF gives the Judge a weird look. Then, he pulls out a Bible. Walter slaps down his hand. 
 Do you swear to the tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? 
 
! Walter bounces out, a bit manic. He runs back to his lawyer table, then spins to address the empty witness stand. 
 Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of innuendo and contradictory testimony about the genesis of the "big-eyed waifs." Would you mind clarifying to this court, once and for all, who spawned these paintings? Walter sprints back into the witness stand. He sits, then reacts coyly, as if he's surprised. 
 Why -- I created the children. Walter starts to stand again -- but the Judge SLAMS his bench. 
 The choreography is not necessary. Just sit down and testify. Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts... We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully... 
 I've had a wonderful life. I've been an artist, a world traveler, a friend of untold celebrities... (he gets misty-eyed) But when I look back at it all, when I peer into my heart and define what mattered... 
 WALTER (CONT'D) it is that I was dedicated to the hungry children of the world. 
 (GENUINE) It all began in Berlin. After World War II... 
 ...the orphans were clutching the barbed wire. Their bodies lacerated, their fingers scrawny, their eyes big and helpless. Imploring me, begging me... "Do something!" 
 ...and then Miss Joan Crawford walked up to me... 
 ...Kim Novak... 
 ...Liberace... 
 ...Wayne Newton... 
 Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, "That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life." The Judge is bored out of his mind. 
 I was born in a small town. My father made upholstery for the automobile 
 -- 
 You're done. Walter stops, surprised. 
 B-but, I'm not finished -- 
 Actually, you are! (he blows his stack) I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. You're not testifying -- you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging nonsense. 
 (BEAT) We can stay here until we grow old and die... but it's obvious that this case boils down to your word versus Mrs. Keane's word. 
 
 (HOPEFUL) So... mistrial? 
 NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. You are both going to paint. Walter gasps, stunned. All color drains from his face. 
 ANGLE - MARGARET Her face lights up. She slowly breaks into a satisfied smile. 
 Awright, bring those easels down. Careful, don't bump anything... watch it with those paint cans, I got some newspaper on the floor down front... The Jury is fascinated. Margaret watches, quite eager. In the gallery, Jane grins. But Walter is horrified. Trying not to tremble. 
 The Bailiff directs the deputies, setting up TWO EASELS, back to back. On each easel is placed a small square canvas. The Judge addresses the room. 
 Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. I don't know much about these things -- I'm a jurist, not an art critic -- but, is one hour enough? Margaret nods: Sure. Shaking, Walter barely moves his head. 
 Okay then. You've both been provided with identical supplies... so -- without any further business... Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours. 
 takes a pencil. She peeks over at Walter -- who's still glued to his seat. His face tight, his expression queasy. Staring off to some faraway place. Margaret looks up at the CLOCK. 3:20. Okay then. Totally calm, in a motion she's done so many times, she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif. Everybody watches. Effortlessly, she pencils the EYES. They are enormous. The largest orbs she has ever done. 
 looks ill. Wracked with uncertainty. The Judge turns to him. 
 Mr. Keane? 
 
 (FAINT) I'm... setting the mood. 
 
 (BEAT) Well, your muse has 58 minutes. 
 fills in more detail. Ears... nose... then, little fingers clutching a fence. The child is peeking over it, staring right at us... 
 is melting down. In total crisis... 
 finishes penciling. She leans back, satisfied with the composition. Then, she reaches for... the PAINT. She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette. She rests it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone... 
 feels all eyes on him. He has to do something. Hesitantly, visibly shaking, he rises from the table. Margaret notices this. 
 
! Walter contorts his face in AGONY. He grabs his shoulder. 
 Mr. Keane! Are you all right? 
 No -- it's -- 
 I -- I don't think I'll be able to paint today. 
 peers at Walter, knowingly. She's not surprised. This was his only way out. A look between them -- and then she cocks a half-smile and turns back to the canvas. She squirts out some white oil paint, then begins painting the eyes. 
 sinks down in his chair, beaten. All life gone. He stares at the emerging canvas, eyes wide, and we PUSH INTO'S FACE. He is witnessing the end of his empire... the destruction of everything that makes him who he is. We push in TIGHTER... TIGHTER... until the screen fills with his two eyes. 
 Thank you! Thank you so much. 
 #2 What are you going to call the painting? She smiles, clutching the finished Waif. 
 "Exhibit 224." They all ROAR with laughter. A Reporter does a stand-up: 
 #1 The jury found in favor of Margaret Keane on all points. She won on charges of defamation, emotional distress, damaged reputation -- 
 What a group of idiots... a quagmire of incompetence... 
 #2 Margaret! Do you feel vindicated by the high award? 
 Oh... it was never about the money. And honestly -- I doubt Walter will even pay. 
 I just wanted credit for what I had done. The justice is... I got my art back. 
 Margaret! Could I possibly have your autograph? Margaret looks down -- and realizes the book is Walter's volume of "TOMORROW'S MASTERS" Margaret stares at it in wonder, then quickly signs the cover. 
 CLOSEUP - MARGARET We hold. She slowly smiles in pride.

 (BEAT) Now, Mister Wing, you're attached to your business. I appreciate that. I'm attached to my own business. I develop the biggest buildings in New York, and you sell, ah, little things. Fine. But I'm not just talking about money here. On the big-screen TV, the IMAGE widens to incim a an easel beside Clam , holding an architect's RENDER that shows the grandiose of a huge office building,.. 
 (READS) "The Clamp Chinatown Center -- Where Business Gets Oriented." When I put up a building, it's the biggest -- it's the newest -- it's the best. People are going to be killing each other to get into this building -- The soft O.S. TWITTERING of Gizmo is heard from the rear alcove of the store. 
 (O.S.) Tee vee! 
 MR. WING Yes -- a man can always agree with others. It is more difficult to agree with oneself. 
 Does that mean you -- He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he answers Forster. 
 MR. WING I'm sorry. Please tell Mister Clamp that the answer is no. 
 Keep the TV. As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to change the TV CHANNEL. With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie 
: 
 To survive a war... you've got to become war. Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES. 
 (0.3.) Neat! 
 MR. WING Television again! Ai-vuh !. An - invention for fools. 
 As he starts COUGHING again, 
 I'm sorry that didn't work out, sir. I thought he'd like the TV. 
 You hear that cough? The guy must be eighty -- maybe ninety. We can wait. 
. 
 "is Then we go to the boss -- The video IMAGE SWITCHES to Clamp being interviewed behind his spotless, high-tech desk. 
 That old guy had some neat stuff in his store. You think they'll auction it off, or...? 
 Nash...I hear they're just gonna tear it down. 
 
 (V.0.) It's like a jungle sometimes, It makes me wonder How I keep from going under... 
 I should be finished by six tonight. If we go straight from work, we can make the Early Bird Special at the movies. 
 Mister Futterman must be getting better, if he can travel. 
 I guess having a bunch of monsters drive a snow plow through jour living room could kind of that to you. He almost got kied. 
 You goin' a' the airport? 
 Billy...I don't think we're getting the hang of New York. 
 A lot of people aren't as thered by that kind of thing as you are, Billy. 
 That's okay. We don't have to wait. 
 I didn't get you the job, I just heard about it. Billy, you can get promoted and stuff if you want to, but you have to act like you deserve it. Let people know you're there. 
 (O.S.) Aagghhh! 
 Uh-uh. They use a regular door instead. 
 .hope you've enjoyed your tour of the world's most modern automated office building. Don't forget, copies of Mr. Clamp's best-selling book, I Took Manhattan, are on sale at the newsstand... 
 Don't let things get to you. 
 (V.O.) Thank you for pushing the button. The elevator will be here soon. Nearby, CAMERA picks up Daniel Clamp's lieutenant Forster. As Forster walks hurriedly through the lobby, his belt pager 
. At the sound, Forster changes course, heading for an ALCOVE offer the lobby, where he unlks_ a cabinet and opens it ' -�"eveal it big TV SCREEN with Clamp's impatient face on it, and a i&e _ CAMERA on top. 
 J (ON TV) So I wan A is place running like a clock the systems, the people, verything. 
 Yes sir. I'm doing a decor compliance check this morning. Tonight I'm doing a random drug search, and -- He's interrupted as an aging MAN IN A DRACULA COSTUME (GRANDPA FRED) comes over to the cabinet and tries to address Clamp over the TV hookup. 
 Excuse me. Mister Clamp, could I speak with you for a -- 
 We're busy. 
 I just need a -- Forster snaps the cabinet shut. 
 I said -- we're busy. 
 Billy -- 
 Your Chinatown drawing. We have to have it. It's a crisis panic emergency. The printers are killing us -- 
(V.O.) Please state your desired floor number. 
 
 I've got thirty- (to two people ' elevator) screaming at me for -- Sixt-- 
 (V.0.) Your request is floor thirty-two. Digital NUMBERS flash past on the elevator's display. 
 (to elevator) No, no, not thirty-- 
 (V.0.) You have cancelled floor thirty-two. The elevator violently STOPS SHORT, tossing everybody around. 
 0 (to elevator) Sixteen. (to BiIIy) I hate this thing. The elevator stops at their floor, and the doors open. Billy follows Marla out into 18 INT. OFFICE AREA.----''s 18 The advertising department of Daniel Clamp's empire occupies modern, "open-plan" offices -- endless beige partitions form tiny CUBICLES full of "ergonomic" furniture. Unseen speakers pipe in "WHITE NOISE" -- low-volume static to insulate conversations. 
 Listen, this deadline. Its not my fault. They're making me miserable so I have to make you miserable. It's a complete heart attack disaster horgor story. As Billy and Marla walk, t ass a WORKER who's -t4ing to get a drink from the d ar ygr WATER_ When he pushes the button, the f ain'ss ,got' VERSHOOTS by several inches, SPLASHING onto The worker contorts himself to get, a drink,,b is face SPLASHED when the fountain surges. Billy and Marla a4lie at Billy's cubicle, whose "work station" consists of a dra g board and several drawers. The PHONE is equipped with a VIDEO SCREEN. SPOT a small, struggling POTTED PLANT, and, pinned to the cubicle wall, Billy's DRAWING of the main street of Kingston Falls. On Billy's drawing board is an illustration of Clamp's projected Chinatown building -- _a l s monstrosity with insane pagoda touches. But Billy has tried to breathe some' 3 e into it, wit r T the street, kids flying dragon kites, etc. Marla looks over Billy's shoulder at the drawing. 
 That courtyard looks cold. That'd be nicer with the trees. 
 Elms. 
 Hi, Mister Forster. Forster nods at Marla, runs an eye over Billy's cubicle. 
 It looks like somebody hasn't( i employee manual...d ' 1 it, r As he speaks, Forster opens a �therette folder and takes out a bar-code reading WAND attached to the folder by curly cable. He runs the wand over the bar-code on Billy's chest, and reads from an LCD display in the 0 folder. 
 FORSTER (CONT.) -- Peltzer. 
 Unauthorized potted plant -- possible aphid infestation. As Forster's assistant jots on his clipboard, Billy puts the plant in a desk drawer, and Forster spots Billy's drawing on his partition. 
 What ig this? 
 Mister Peltier, do you know how much the Clamp organization has spent to provide its employees with art by recognized artists at this facility? 
 FORSTER (CONT.) Eye-resting. Color-coordinated. Authorized, 
 A little touch, yes. Maybe eyerybods here would like to do some little touches. Coffee mugs that say "World's Greatest Lover." The cute little hula doll they bought in Hawaii. The "Snoopy" comic that just says it JJ1. You'd like that, wouldn't qu, Mister Peltzer? d 1 
 Coming to work every day in a Jy_Q hundred million dollar flea marks XZZ He turns to move on. 0 
 With a "z," right? As the assistant follows Forster away, Billy puts his drawing of Kingston Falls in a pocket. Marla stews. 
 Billy, this is Just what I don't need right now. Do you realize we've got department review in three weeks? This is a nuclear meltdown disaster, I mean it. 
 The Clamp Centre is the most advanced "smart building" in America, with the latest, in security, communications, and climate control. If you'll follow me over here... Still talking, she takes them toward a STAIRCASE. 
 KATE (CONT.) The Clamp Centre is just one part of Mister Clamp's round-the-world business network, which includes construction, sports, finance, and a popular line of jams and jellies...and, of course, as those of you who have cable TV at home know, the Clamp Cable Network. 20 INT. CABLE STUDIOS 4,t1iOL ROOM 20 CLOSE on a VIDEO IMAGE oft v With Marge show. MARGE 0 takes a dish from one of many ' r ovens on her set. 
 .some people have written in to say that, if they're serving these dishes in a dark room, maybe for those romantic occasions, they notice a glow coming from some of the meat courses. Now, that's perfectly normal... REVEAL that this image is on a control-room monitor at the Clamp Cable studios. Billy, carrying a shopping bag, passes the control roomand turns down a narrow hallway. 
 .tonight's movie is so scary -- the people who saw it when it came out in the theaters twelve years ago are just learning how to speak simple phrases and eat solid food again! That's right'. Talk about scary' It's a good thing your Grandpa Fred is here with you -- He waits for something he expected to hear, but it doesn't happen. He breaks character. 
 (C0 ) Where's the moan? 
 (0. (on P.A. from boo The what? 
 The moan. There's posed to be a moan, from t ck, and I say, "Oh, Renfield, y a o u want some more flies, don't you," and I go back there and open the door -- 
 (O.S.) Oh. Sorry, Fred. Can somebody find the tape with the moan? Grandpa Fred sits down, disgusted. Billy goes over to him. 
 A mistake? Kid. it's a disaster. People that watch TV at three-thirty in the morning are not scared of the Wolfman. The only thing that scares those people is getting sober and finding work. 
 Watch it with that thing. Billy puts the bat on top of a cobwebbed TV SET that's part of Grandpa Fred's set. 
 Frankly, kid, this was not what I had in mind. I went Into broadcasting, I wanted to do news. Public affairs. Something meaningful. 
 All the great horror movies are in black and white. Mister Clamp only likes color. I donky ven have a gimmick. No species effects. A puppet that c s out of a box -- whoopee. 
 (O.S.) O We've got the moan, Fred. A listless, anemic MOAN is heard through the P.A. 
 That's the moan? 
 (O.S.) That's what we've got, Fred. And... rolling... Grandpa Fred gamely goes back into character. 
 Oh, Renfield, you want some --

 You. got that right, kid. Have you heard these voices they have here now? Don't look at me like that. You know that white noise they play all the time? The static? 
 Sure. But if you listen to it -- there are little voices in there. 
 Let me hear the voices. The technician brings up VOICES on a speaker. They sound like voice-overs on slick TV commercials. 
 ANNOUNCERS' VOICES (dynamic many .I'm an honest kind of guy -- and not stealing office supplies works for me, and e way I live today... 
 That's fine -- 
 Yes, Mister Clamp. 
 That's terrific, sir. 
 Yes sir. Tall! 
 I'll -- But a Camp LOGO ;ills the monitor screen, and Clamp's face disappe rs behipo- it. Forster turns and looks over a technician's shoulder at a MONITOR. A spy CAMERA shows a stressed-out EMPLOYEE lighting a cigarette in a STOREROOM.

 FORSTER. 5NT.) That's an unaut iz,pd break period, pal. a don't work here anymore. On the monitor, the startled employee looks around for the source of the voice. 
 FORSTER (CONT.) We have a problem communicating here? You're gone. Clean out the desk. One hour. Thanks so much. He puts down the mike, and moves on to lczg�..�aatier°`t4`S'"sioul"d?r p switch marked OXYGEN. ' 
 At four o'clock, people go into a slump. Then we give them oxygen,

 Yeah, got a delivery here.. He follows her back to 
 What kind of stuff do they do-ft there, anyway? 
 We're not supposed to talk about it. 
 Huh. This is for Doctor Catheter. 
 I can sign for it. 
 Okay. This copy's yours. Thanks. Whistling Gizmo's tune again, the messenger leaves the office -- almost running into DR. CATHETER, Splice-o-Life's chief scientist, who's on his way in. 
 Doctor Catheter, this just came for you. 
 DR. CATHETER (taking package) Oh, good. This might be my malaria... (opening package) No, this is just rabies. I have rabies. And I was supposed to get the flu this week. 
 
 I think the flu is on b;Eo -order. She takes out a Kleenex, blows he(;Z>nose again. Dr. Catheter holds his hand out. Q 
 DR. CATHETE May I have that, Peg 
 Q) Oh, uh -- sure... Dr. Catheter takes the Kleenex, and heads for the inner office. 
 DR. CATHETER (shakes his head) Back order. All a man wants is some fresh germs... FOLLOW Catheter back to 
 DR. CATHETER Hello, Wally. Your lights are flickering again. 
 DR. CATHETER You'll get it, Wally. 
 DR. CATHETER Yes, but they only come out at night. 
 DR. CATHETER Very nice. Catheter draws closer to Wally, and speaks with creepy 
: 
 DR. CATHBTF " 
 0 Wally, could you let me have some growth hormone? I'm a little short. FOLLOW Catheter to another side of the lab, where two moreS are at work. One of them (LEWIS) greets Catheter, while the other (MARTIN) has his back to us at the moment. 
 Hi, Doctor. 
 DR. CATHETER How's that cloning work coming? Martin turns around. He is Lewis's IDENTICAL TWIN. 
 R R e l_ well, Doctor. The twins talk in rapid e nation, as if they share a brain. LEWIS t A Say, Doctor, look at 
 .I think you'll find it interesting. Following the SOUND of the crooning that caught the messenger's attention, they take Catheter over to a lab table where the LIGHTS ARE LOWERED above a covered cage. Martin pulls back the cloth to reveal GIZMO, who stops singing and looks up at them. 
 Some sort of rodent, apparently... 
 .and it can't take bright light. 
 Watch this, Doctor. He opens the side door of Gizmo's cage and turns on a TAPE PLAYER. Hearing the bouncy ROCK MUSIC, Gizmo playfully DANCES out of the cage as the scientists talk. 
 DR. CATHETER Hmp! Qu-te, isn't he? 
 That may be genetic... 
 .we're not sure yet. But as he amuses his captors, Gizmo is slyly looking around for a way out of here. He edges farther away from the cage... 
 DR. CATHETER Not so fast, pal. He abruptly switches the MUSIC off, and GRABS Gizmo just before the Mogwai can make good his escape. Dr. Catheter sticks the frightened Gizmo back in the cage, and shuts the side door firmly. 
 Sorry, sir 
 DR. CATHETER How are you going to pro, with him? (vim

 .tissue culture hursday. 
 DR. CATHETER And then there's body structure. And for that, my little friend... The three scientists LOOM over the terrified Gizmo. Dr. Catheter reaches into the cage to give Gizmo a POKE. 
 Jump around. 
 You sat still for too long. The building thinks you left. It's saving energy. Jump around. Billy jumps around, and the LIGHTS come back on, as the messenger who visited the genetics lab comes to the Cubicle Neighbor's desk with a package. 
 Package for you. 
 Oh. Thanks. But as the Cubicle Neighbor signs the�(P erwork, the messenger whistles to himself -- Gizmo's song min, in that sad minor. For a moment, Billy doesn't regis t -- and then CAMERA catches the realization dawningQ� s face, as he looks over the cubicle partition and asks ijr'lntly: 
 Huh? 
 Oh, uh -- 
 (HUMS) Dah dah, dah dah dah dah -- isn't that by Sting? 
 Oh, hey -- I know. I was up in that laboratory, you know, on eighteen, and somebody was, like, humming it -- 
 Nuh-uh, it was in the back -- Billy takes off. 
 Oh. Hi. It's back in ther4. 
 This is the most interesting bio- electrical work I've ever been involved in. Here you go, boy... He FEEDS the rat some liquid from a VIAL with a LIGHTNING-BOLT insignia on its label. 
 Think of it...millions of rats in New York, and everyone hates them... 
 But if one of them could power a portable radio for a month... He throws the switch. The rat's eyes WIDEN, then calm down as the current goes off. Dr. Catheter touches the rat, and quickly pulls his hand back from the electric SHOCK. 
 DR. CATHETER Definite progress, fellows. if we could just make it safe to touch them... 
 ANGLE - BILLY He wanders back to the corner zmo's voice is coming from. Two caged MONKEYS chatter at lm as he passes. 
 Theodore! What are you doing out? 
 Alvin! Put down that DNA! As the scientists chase the monkeys, Billy hurries to Gizmo's cage. He opens the cage, and HIS EYES MEET GIZMO'S -- it's hard to say which of then is more excited. But the gala reunion will have to wait. Billy scoops Gizmo into his toolbox. He walks out of the lab, leaving the copier a mess. 
 (Twitterpg of strong agreement.) 
 You're wetting my shoes, Peltzer. Billy sees Forster, sees the shoes, grabs a paper towel and is about to drop to his knees. 
 Stand up, Peltzer. Come with me. Billy grabs the tool box and follows Forster out the door. As they go into the anteroom, Forster's clipboard-carrying ASSISTANT joins them. # 
 Do you know what that eans, Peltzer? 
 What is the man holding? 
 On the sign, Peltzer. 
 That's right. Because this -- is the executive washroom. I don't think you belong in there, do you Peltzer? 
 
 (READING) Lateness infractions... and these SAT scores -- 
 What's in the box, Peltzer? 
 Hm. I think our "random" drug search later on should be very interesting. 
 (jots on clipboard) Got it, sir. 
 (Muffled twitter of acquiescence. 
 Mister Clamp -- sir, I'm Marla Bloodstone, I'm the department head here, if there's anything I can -- 
 That's okay. Everybody just relax, and go back to what you'd be doing normally. I know I haven't been down here before, but that's going to change. I'm going to be a little more "hands-on" with these operations from now on... As he speaks, Clamp glances over Billy's shoulder, and spots the Chinatown drawing. 
 CLA' ?10 NT. ) Hey, t.h,s is ex 1A 
 You've captured the whole essence of the project here. Look at the kids with the kites. That's warmth. I like warmth. What's your name? 
 That's what we need here. People who produce. (points to drawing) Let's lose these elm trees, though. People think "elm," they think "Dutch," "disease" -- Gizmo's drawer rattles open. Billy snaps it shut. 
 CLAMP (CONT.) What's with that drawer? 
 Huh. I didn't know about that one. He moves on, nodding vaguely at Marla -- who goes over to Billy, looking at him through completely new eyes. 
 Did you hear that? "People who produce. I've been working here six years, and I've never even seen him in person. 
) 
 This is big, Billy. T i.s career opportunity,q4 cement window.For both 
 Clearly. We can talk about it at dinner. 
 Tonight. 
 I've got something tonight too, Billy. A brochure for the Clamp Cable Archery Channel. It's a total suicide trauma red alert deadline situation. And you know what? I'm letting it go to have dinner with you. 
 What ,g with that drawer, Billy? I know every feature in this building. We don't have anything that opens itself. 
 Billy, are you keeping some kind of ppI in there? It's a good thing Mister Clamp likes you so much, because -- 
 Great. There's this very chic new restaurant. It's Canadian. They clean the fish right at your table. 
 Let me just grab my coat, and I'll be right back. As Marla goes O.S., Billy slips Gizmo's drawer open and talks into it. 
 Ready? 
 Hi! I'm almost ready -- 
 What's wrong? 
 Oh, damn. 
 In the middle of the night? 
 What? 
 Take him ham? Billy, this is nuts. If those things start running around in New York -- 
 Can't he Just -- go back where you found his? 
 
 (SIGHS) Okay. Let me take this stuff off and punch out, and then I'll go get his. 
)( Waco ! -- as Gizmo watches the ra,k n :,wa t basket TIP OVER. Looking into the basket, we (and Gizmo) SE ` umble of office wastepaper, which is violently toss e ut... .until MOHAWK, the fourth new Mogwai, emerges. This guy is pure, malicious evil, a new strain of badness. Even as a furry Mogwai, he's about as cuddly as a cockroach. While Daffy, up on the desktop, starts playing with everything in sight... .Mohawk, on the floor, moves in on Gizmo. 
 Uh-oh. George and Lenny drop down to the carpet to join Mohawk, as Gizmo -- standing now -- backs away. There's a grated VENT opening low on the wall behind him. Lenny grabs Gizmo with a fast-moving paw, and Mohawk, moving in close, SPITS in Gizmo's eyes. 
 Wa-hogs ! 
 Hah! Good boy! I knew we'd find something in this guy's desk -- -- but as they reach Billy's desk, they find Daffy's paint PAW PRINTS tracking crazily over every surface. The dog keeps going bananas, but it's not drugs he smells -- it's the dander of the recently departed Daffy. 
 FORSTER (CONT.) Look at this mess! What kind of footprints are these? 
 Hard to say, sir. A possible 
 He's bringing pets to work. I don't believe this guy-it's not just plants. He's got to have 1,_. e s t ock . 
 KATE (CONT.) Billy said to take you home. You'd better stay in my purse till we get out of the building. 
 
 Did you always know you were going to be an artist? 
 I had crayons too, i y. And when I was four years old, I was using them to write dos to the other children. Even then, I knew. C_j 
 
 Isn't this great? We' _Jinally getting to know each otdr. You can't do that in an office. 
 Right. Now, let's talk strategy. You realize, this changes everything -- for you, me, the department... 
 Your relationship to Mister Clamp. Your access. I can see a future, Billy. I see more office space...embossed letterhead...I see us -- (lowers her voice) -- swallowing up the publicity department. 
 You have talent, Billy, and that's wonderful. It's a God-given blessing situation. But even an artist has to have goals. 
 I can help you reach those goals, Billy. If we join forces... 
 (0.S.) Sir? -- a WAITER appears at Billy's side, holding a platter containing a large MOOSE HEAD sculpted out of CHOCOLATE. Billy is so startled to find the moose staring at him that he SPILLS his beer in his lap. Maria quickly withdraws her foot, and Billy blots at the spill with a napkin. 
 Oh, that's okay -- 
 MARLA (CONT.) -- see you tomorrow. 
 Billy said to make sure and feed you before midnight... As she arranges chicken and mashed potatoes on a plate, Daffy spots a BLENDER next to him. He recoils from it -- then, with an evil grin, he shoves it off the counter while Kate's back is turned, BREAKING it. When she turns and looks, Daffy has an innocent loops" expression on his face. 
 Oh, God-you have to be careful here, okay, Gizmo? We don't have the money to replac things. Daffy nods contritely. Ka ings him the food. 
. } Let's see i f CWu ' l i eat this -- Daffy grabs a chick li�g, opens his mouth as wide as Joe E. Brown's, clamps 0 -11 n the drumstick, and strips all the meat off in one fast ion, bringing out a spotless bone. With his other paw, Daffy tries the mashed potatoes. He hates them, and PITCHES what he's holding, getting half the wad on Kate and half on the refrigerator. 
 KATE (CONT.) I don't know what Billy sees in you. Daffy WHOOPS, grabs more chicken, and resumes eating. 
 
 It's in the kitchen. Billy -- She FOLLOWS him to the kitchen. 
 Yes -- 
 In your office -- near that drawer, where you said -- Billy, look out! Too late -- Daffy LOBS a single-serving PUDDING-PACK at Billy. It bursts on impact, staining his shirt. 
 Billy -- you said there weren't going to be those -- 
 (indicates Daffy) What about -- him? 
 
 (SEMI-INTELLIGIBLE) Wahoo! No! Elbow room! Don't fence me -- 
 About what? 
 Who could it be this late? 
 Mister Futterman! Mrs. Futterman... 
 MR. FUTTERMAN We thought so too. The guys in my old outfit, they changed the date for the reunion. We tried to call 
 Thirty-two hours'. We're sorry to come here so late -- 
 No, no, that's okay. Would you like some coffee, or -- 
 No, don't you go to any trouble, hon. 
 MR. FUTTERMAN Boy, we tried to get a cab up here -- did you know they have RUgsiLan guys drivin' cabs in this burg? What if somebody gets in one of those cabs with a briefcase full of atomic secrets? Is anyone thinking about that? 
 Murray, you remember what Doctor Kaplan said. We're going to stay nice and calm -- (to Billy) Murray was a little... distressed after, you know, what happened with those, um -- (mimes Gremlin) 
 MR. FUTTERMAN Aah, I'm fine. I was just a little jumpy for a while -- Billy's daypack SQUEAKS. Billy slips the bag under his arm and squeezes it, forcibly quieting Daffy. 
 It's okay, honey. I hear it too. 
 MR. FURMAN Of course you hea it too. What do you mean? 
 It's, uh -- plumbing here. It...makes n e sometimes. Sheila, looking at qty, spots something -- iE I LA Oh, Mur I think we interrupt these two. 
 MR. FUTTERMAN Huh? Billy realizes what Sheila is talking about, as she takes out a handkerchief and dabs at the lipstick on his face. 
 MR. FUTTERMAN �� Bugs, huh? Yeah, you can't be careful these days. All k t weird bugs eosin' into +he country... 
 Oh. Well, that's okay, Billy -- 
 MR. FUTTERMAN Sure -- we'll just book into a } hotel. 
 I believe you. 
 I .so that's a Kona praline and banana-berry swirl with kiwis and peanut butter cups? 
 Yeah ...or, wait"rfre j't yep peanut butter cups all nui�(�/ 
 1 0 I'm not sure...Alexis, are the peanut butter cups all natural? As Yogurt Jerk 2 joins the discussion, a new ANGLE finds a furry PAW turning on two spigots on the yogurt machine. FOLLOW the two streams of goo over the machine's spill grate and down to the floor. Hidden from view by the counter, Mohawk, George, and Lenny reach for the trickling yogurt... .check the lobby CLOCK as the time TICKS past midnight... 
 Yum! .and sloppily chow down. Up above, Yogurt Jerk I turns to the machine, sees the two spigots flowing. She's about to turn them off, but a complaining CUSTOMER stops her. 
 2 Miss, I asked for Oreo cookies and Gummy Bears -- this stuff is, like -- hair. 
 1 Ma'am, we don't have anything that's like -- 
 2 What is it? It's a t.! 
 (O.S.) Yum! 
 3 What's going on here? Did that woman say there are rats? 
 2 Um, no, sir, she said there are mQ rats here -- 
 2 '"' .I don't just want a different yogurt, I want d&akrxes -- 
 1 I don't know, a fa= thing. And it's supposed to be health food. Billy checks the lobby clock -- 12:10. He Pulls Kate aside. 
 It's along here... They come to a deep, square RECESS in the wall. Inside is massive MACHINERY -- pipes, pumps, meters -- surrounded by a 
 KATE (CONT.) This is where the water comes into the building. 
 Give me video. The technician types a command, and a video IMAGE of Billy attacking the cage appears on the screen. 
 SUPERVISOR (CONT.) Guards. 
 Back off! Put your hds up. Billy backs off the cage and ss a coming toward him, flashlight and gun in hand. As he gets close, Daffy starts bouncing around in the daypaelr again. The guard trains his gun on the leather bag. 
) 
 What's in the bag pal?, 
 Oh yeah? Let's have a look. 
 Aagghhh! When the guard pulls his head up, Daffy is hanging onto the guard's NOSE by his teeth. The guard flails his head furiously around, until Daffy finally flies free -- 
 Tell you what, pal -- you can tell the cops all about these monsters, I'm sure they'll be very interested... As he takes Billy away, CAMERA holds on a spot over their heads...goes into a GAP between the concrete wall and ceiling ...and finds three big COCOONS. Their slimy bodies gleam dully in the yellow lamplight. As we watch, the cocoons silently GROW and change, gathering strength... 
 It was easy -- I just gave them a next month's rent. 
 Six-thirty.

 Bil - lee -- -- but a GREEN CLAW GRABS HIM FROM BEHIND, jerking him backward, off his feet. 
 Billy, what if they're already -- Suddenly, the lobby LIGHTS DIM, d Billy looks up. BILLY t.0 They are. Come on.. 
 GRANDPA � ,ED Hey, Billy -- the-building's completely screwe p today -- 
 (watching them go) Sure. You're young. You know everything. Billy and Kate arrive at the newsstand, where Billy grabs four souvenir FLASHLIGHTS in the shape of the building. 
 Eighty-six thirty-eight with tax. 
 Four times nineteen ninety-five -- 
 Good morning, Billy. That was so aim, last night. We're going to have to do that again -- 
 Oops, I'd better get going. See you ui tairs, Billy. 
) Hi. 
 Don't do any explaining right now, okay? I'm too mad. A guide calls Kate from the guide office. 
 Kate -- you're up, honey. 
 Excuse me. I have to go to work now. 
 0 Billy -- if we all get through today alive, you're in h,g, trouble. 
 Excuse me...do you have any styles that aren't, urn, fringed? They hold up several pairs of pants. All of them are "fringed" from the knees down -- as if they'd been CLAWED to tatters. From the store's back room, we HEAR a whoop. It's familiar, but the VOICE has become deep, raspy, and such less innocent. 
 (O.S.) Wa- ! 
 Oh, we do? Why's that? 
 This is drugs. It's got to be. You're on a groovy little trio, aren't you, Peltzer? Well, let me tell you something, Mister Flower Child -- 
 Sir -- I'm sorry, but you have to keep up with the rest of the group... 
 Excellent! Thank you! Please give me some right profile as you continue speaking! 
 Uh, If we're very quiet, we can go in here and watch a program being videotaped... 
 Now, this week here on "Microwave With Marge" is our special "Salute to Luncheon Meats" and I'm very , excited about t ecipes, so let's just jump k ome hors d'oeuvres. You kn t logna and bean dip roll-ups-a IS when friends drop over, and f I o want to make it a little extra special, you can get some of these little sword-shaped toothpicks, you put that through the bologna, and that's your "Viva Zapata" appetizer. People are simply crazy about these... 
 "The rules." I can't believe this. 
. Before the technician can move, the arms are going for his throat -- and MOHAWK, now a bloodthirsty Gremlin, emerges from the wreckage of the console, still CHOKING the technician. 
 TECHNICIAN 2 (CONT.) Help -- me -- At the sight of Mohawi�rster jumps back. Technician 1 tries to move on the Gremli 34o awk takes a claw from his victim's neck and SLASHES a ian 1's arm, driving him back. Billy pulls out his building-shag plight and SHINES it at the Gremlin. Recoiling, the Gremlin s go of the technician, who falls to the floor -- dead. 
 This is how we used to cook for big groups, before we had our microwave ovens and the other modern appliances. It would take days to plan the menu, and hours over a hot stove to do the cooking. But now, we can make this same tuna-noodle cheez-product chowder surprise in just a few minutes, and you can feed anything from a high school reunion to a complete chain gang with this kind of quantity. 
 MARGE (CONT.) Whew! Now, if we step over here... But as she starts to turn away, the LIGHTS on the set suddenly 
. 
 Huh. Brownout or something. Marge HEARS a TAPPING noise from inside the soup pot. Confused, she lifts the lid -- and JUMPS BACK, as LENNY -- now a GREMLIN, but his dopey face still recognizable -- sits up in the soup pot, wearing a chef's hat, and SPLATTERS Marge with orange noodle-casserole GOO. He whips out a TURKEY EASTER, and SQUIRTS Marge with it. 
 
 06 
 Look out! -- and THE OVENS EXPLODE, showering the set with GLASS. As Marge and her cameraman escape the studio, the ovens catch FIRE. The flames lick up toward the ceiling -- -- and set off the SPRINKLERS. George and Lenny grin, standing tall to shower in the spray. As the water hits, BUBBLES appear on the Gremlins' backs. Close on the bubbles, CAMERA finds the tiny heads of GREMLIN OFFSPRING, getting ready to burst out. As the studio fills with the ominous SMOKE and COLORED LIGHT of Gremlin multiplication, Kate runs from the room. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 TECHNICIAN 4 (CONT.) (points to screen) The Peat Infestation Monitor... -- and sees, on the technician's screen, an alarmingly rapid proliferation of DOTS, spreading over the diagram of the building. The dots started as a cluster in the cable TV studio area -- Microwave Marge's studio -- but they're spreading out to other floors, and moving around quickly. FORSTER is', What is that? That' 01 at rats, is it? 
 No sir, I'm afraid s not -- A VIDEOPHONE RINGS near Technician 3; he grabs it. 
 A►N 3 Systems Control KATE'S FACE fills the videci)hone SCREEN. 
 Thank you. 
 Thirty-eight. But the VOICE that croaks back isn't the usual elevator voice. 
 (V.O.) 
 HAve you shredded my mail from this morning? 
 (V.0.) (over intercom) I'm just finishing, Mister Clamp. 
 Good. Let's do some memos... 
 You're not my secretary. The Gremlin responds by grabbing a SILEX POT of boiling-hot water from the nearby coffee station, and FLINGING the boiling water at Clamp -- -- who ducks it, as it SCALDS the paint on the wall behind him. Clamp makes a tentative move toward the Gremlin, who THROWS the empty Silex. It barely misses Clamp, and SMASHES against the wall. The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to bat it away from his face, like a kid panicked by a moth -- -- but his flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is caught in the hopper of the secretary's SHREDDER. Hating to do it, using only his fingertips, Clamp PUSHES the struggling Gremlin down into the machine -- -- which SPRAYS him out of the bottom like a black, bloody, eyes-only memo of DEATU. As Clamp stands gasping ®de the machine, the door to the corridor opens, and Billlybu in. He sees the shredder, and 0 the tattered Gremlin remaips 4 j ng from it. 
 I think so..-.I hate using these machines myself. 
 Mister Clamp, there's a situation in -- (sees shredder) My God, what -- 
 Yeah? What happens at sundown? 
 He should be in custody. He's dangerous. 
 Bangerous' is thing that was in here a min go -- that was dangerous. is 's from the art department. i 
 Yeah? Ask him how he knows so much about these -- green things. 
 That's a good question, Bill. How dQ you know about them? 
 Of course. Those guys. (to Forster) I warned you that could be a problem tenant. We could have had three shrinks and a plastic surgeon in that space. But no... 
 
 
 (V.0.) You have requested a floor that is not part of the building at this time... And now Kate SEES CLAWS tearing at the corners of the elevator car, trying to gouge their way inside. The O.S. SOUND of GREMLIN LAUGHTER echoes in the elevator shaft. Kate shrinks into the middle of the floor, her hands braced against the walls -- 
 -- 
) 
 I There are some nice shops here in the building... 
 1 (indicates other 
) We'll get the next one. 
 I'll tell you what we have to do. We have to get a lid on this thing and keep it on. No cops, no media. We'll handle it. (to Forster) Go down to systems control and get on top of this thing. 
 Me? Um, but there might be -- 
 Not me. 
: ANGLE on a Gremlin trying a vial marked SEX HORMONE. The Gremlin's face registers big consumer satisfaction -- he downs the rest of the vial in one gulp. 
 DR. CATHETER (O. .) �) V My God! As the lab's chief researcher stands in the doorway, unable to 
 Oh no... 
 .not the brain hormone. The Gremlin swallows the vial...twitches for a moment. He painfully croaks out a few WORDS -- 
 I...want...to -- Then, suddenly, the transformation takes hold, in thrashing Jekyll-and-Hyde HISTRIONICS that send the Gremlin rolling on the floor. When he stands, he wears a pair of HORN-RIMMED GLASSES, and SPEAKS FLUENTLY in a new VOICE, similar to that of 
. 
 Nibs:: Brings ! Might I have a brief word' with you? The= t QrenLin:looks curiously at him. 
 (to Bat Gremlin) To the window, my friend! A world of possibilities opens itself to you! Throw off the old constraints... The Bat Gremlin wings toward one of the polarized glass windows... 
 3/31/89 
 .tonight we've got a classic horror movie, from Grandpa Fred's special dungeon -- Fred is interrupted by a MOAN -- not the normal weak moan on the tape, but a genuinely scary GREMLIN moan. He turns around, and sees a grinning GREMLIN emerge from behind the prop tombstone. As Fred heads back there, two other GREMLINS join the first one, and the three of them watch him intently. 
 (O.S. ) Fred, what's the story with those -- things? 
 Uh.. .I don't... One of the Gremlins takes the reel of film from Fred, unreels a little from the loose end and holds it up. A second Gremlin looks at a frame -- mimes terrified shock, then CLUTCHES his chest and falls back onto the floor. The of e%.Gremlins LAUGH. 
 (O.S.) Boy, that's creepy. Okay, rolling... 
 Uh -- Grandpa Fred and his Friends have something horrible in store for you tonight... The Gremlins nod in gleeful agreement. 
 ANGLE - BAR A few PEOPLE are drinking here, but they pay little notice to the NEWSCASTER on the TV set over the bar. 
 4 My broker a ,g s the strongest things in the ecb i f ght now are cigarette' a np4s magazines. 
 Really. IRY00 1-1 
 4 Of course, he's been in jail for a while now... Customer 4 reaches under the salad bar's sneeze-guard with the plastic tongs to pull a clump of lettuce from the bin -- and is horrified to discover that he is holding an ALL-VEGETABLE MUTANT GREMLIN by the ear. This horribly smiling thing has RADISHES for eyes, CORN-row hair, CAULIFLOWER ears, STRINGBEAN lips and - - as it opens its mouth -- a darting WAX-PEPPER TONGUE. As other customers recoil, horrified, Customer 4 tries to drop the Vege-Gremlin, but, baring its sharp ARTICHOKE TEETH, it reaches out with CARROT fingers to grab his shirt and pull his THROUGH the sneeze guard. 
 And now for our videocassette consumer watch -- He gingerly holds up a videocassette of the first Gr,gmlins movie as if it is a long-dead fish. 
 
'. -- he finds a GREMLIN on his desk, staring at him. 
 BROKER (CONT.) (into phone) What? Nothing. Think about those bonds. 'Bye. (hangs up)- The Gremlin points an accusing claw at the broker. 
 Nice tie! The broker starts yanking the tie off, but the Gremlin SWIPES at him, and he beats it, as WIDER ANGLE REVEALS a number of OTHERS also chasing brokers off, and grabbing their phones -- 
 (variously, on phones) Buy! Sell! Sell! Buy! Sell! SPOT the Brain Hormone Gremlin, kicked back in a broker's chair, talking on a phone. 
 .yes, I'd say it's a full-scale panic. Are you having a run on the banks there yet? Well, it's rather brutal here ...we're advising our clients to put everything they've got into canned food and shotguns.. . yes... The TICKER DISPLAY on the wall speeds up, going NUTS. 
 (V.0.) Fire! The untamed element... oldest of man's mysteries... 
 (V.0.) Giver of warmth, destroyer of forests ... right now, this bu; i d ing is on fire... 
 What? 
 $V.O.) Yes, the building is on fire. Leave the building... enact the age- old drama of self- preservation... 
 2 Fire! Fire! PEOPLE from offices'start beating it toward the stairwell exit. 
 Oh, Murray -- what a beautiful building! 
 MR. FUTTERMAN Beautiful? Looks like somethin' out of the dark ages. True, Saint Eva Marie's architecture is on the vy side ...as CAMERA notices the ornate windows and the cor 'te topped with spooky stone GARGOYLES -- (� Wait a minute. That one there...that's �' a`rgoyle... 
 MR. FUTTERMAN (C _Q�� ) 
'' 
 What is it, Murray? It's the FLYING BAT-GREMLIN -- and it leaves its perch to fly 
 MR. FUTTERMAN Hey'. Help! He flails at the Gremlin, batting it away from him, but it keeps coming back -- as Sheila stands back, too terrified to move -- 
 Murray, what is it? 
 MR. FUTTERMAN It's them! (to pedestrians) Help me! Somebody help me! But the NEW YORKERS on the sidewalk continue past him, oblivious. Pjr. 
 Murray -- where are you going? 
 MR. FUTTERMAN We have to tell Billy! Come on! Sheila follows him. 
 DR. CATHETER The horror! The horror! The eakagg! 
 DR. CATHETER What happened? They fought back, that"s what...things...stuff - He grabs Billy's shirt. 
 The hell is he talking about? 
. 
 I can't believe it! This is worse than the first one! A MAN covered with film, obviously the PROJECTIONIST, staggers up to the manager. His clothes are in tatters. 
 I quitt Cali the union'. can the National Guard! A MAN who has been getting popcorn at the nearby candy counter turns and comes over to the group. He is STEVEN SPIELBERG. 
 What seems to be the trouble here? 
 Those things! They've taken over the projector! They refuse to run the rest of the picture! They want to see Snow White Oral thg._yen Dwarfs! 
 Damn! I knew I should have directed this one myself! (beckons across lobby) Hulk... HULK HOGAN, in full wrestling regalia and carrying Raisinets, comes over to join Spielberg. Spielberg points a finger upward -- toward the projection booth in OUR THEATER. Hogan, quickly grasping the situation, addresses the Gremlins in the booth. 
 Okay, you guys listen up! People paid 
- 0 good money to movie' When they go out to a theate ey c Id sodas, hot popcorn, and _ o m ns projection. booth. Do I have to %Offil TS there myself? Do you think the Gre ters can stand up to the Hulkster? Well, if I were you, I'd run the rest of the picture right now. (to audience) Sorry, folks. It won't happen again. 
 S I ...many conflicting reports from people who've come out of the building... 
 2 .stories about a fire, but also reports of an attack by some sort of animals -- again, none of this is confirmed... 
 3 .people who are quite hysterical, talking about some sort of "green men" -- unfortunately, police are not permitting any news media into the building at this time, so we're unable to bring you first-hand coverage, but as soon as... Fred's face registers what he's thinking: this is it. His break. He runs out into the corridor... 
 Hey! 
 Yes? 
 Can you work a TV camera? Katsuji smiles proudly. 
 Work a camera? I master the camera! 
 
 (MUTTERS) Terrific...a screaming catastrophe holocaust murder deadline emergency rush, and there's no E lights... 
 MARLA (CONT,) Great. 
 REVISED - JUNE 22, 1989 
 Get it off me -- But Dr. Catheter is rushing to a CABINET at the back of the lab... 
 DR. CATHETER I've got some small assault weapons... 
 .just tell then everything's under control, we've just had a few Clamp stops as he SEES a wall monitor with a ''CLAMP NEWS NETWORK" sign under it. Grandpa Fred stands amid the LOBBY CARNAGE, covered by Katsuji's slightly jerky hand-held CAMERA 0 Clamp, whitening, flicks the SOUND on. 
 Dracula...? As Fred speaks, Katsuji's CAMERA catches a fast GLIMPSE of GREMLINS in kids' clothes frolicking past in b.g. It's hard for Fred to shake his horror-movie training -- 
 Oh, shit. 
 2 Look, just let us in there. We'll take the responsibility -- 
 Forget it, pal. Most of the people are out of there ow, anyway. 
 ?.0 Then what's in ther been in Beirut -- 
 Yeah? I bet they miss you there. (to crowd) Let's move back, folks..,

MR. FUTTERMAN q, Hold it! Wait! No water! 
 What? 
 MR. FUTTERMAN It's not fire in there -- it's gremlins. If you get water on 'em, they just mu1 in1v. (to cop) You gotta let me in there. I know how to deal with it. 
 Murray -- The cop blocks Mr. Futterman's way. 
 Uh, sure, pal -- look, why don't you calm don a little? Just -- 
 Don't talk t'&Jre Uke I'm crazy -- (realizir;S mself ) I was ner craz ' fine. 
 Bill -- how's it going out there? Any progress? Just tell me there's progress. 
 Bad? It's horrible. There are people in this building. Real lives. You have any idea what kind of lawsuits we're looking at here? 
 Help -- Billy grabs the RECEIVER of a VIDEO-PHONE end steps between Clamp and the Electric Gremlin. At the last possible instant, he holds the receiver up in the Electric Gremlin's path. The glowing beast touches the mouthpiece... .DISAPPEARS inside...and shows up an instant later on the video-phone's SCREEN -- trapped, writhing in pain, as RECORDED VOICES bounce around it and issue from the phone's SPEAKER. 
 (V.O.) 
 (V.0.) While waiting, we invite you to listen to a brief interlude of recorded music. 
 Uh, Bill -- thanks. 
 I thought this would never run, Bill -- but maybe it will. 
 The sign-off. The b sign-off 
 (V.O. ) Because of the end of civilization, the Clamp Cable Network now leaves the air. We hope you have enjoyed our programming -- but, more important, we hope you have enjoyed-life. As the montage continues, a Tiffany-type POP SINGER sings a sprightly version of an old hymn: 
 (V.O.) Yet in my dreams I be Nearer my God to thee... Clamp, watching, wipes away a tear. 
 It's beautiful, isn't it? 
 Bill, there's nothing we can't do in this building. Why? 
 Right. That's the only way out -- the front doors. He takes out a pocket computer-scheduler, c-- pushes a few buttons. `� 0 (CONg. 0 0 The sun sets at -

 Isn't anybody around here? Come on...I nee light in my -- Suddenly, Marla is startled by a BOOMING AMPLIFIED VOICE -- the subliminal tapes from the Systems Control Center, jacked up to more-than-audible volume. 
 (V.O.) -- not stealing office supplies works for me, and the way I live today... 
 What? 
 1 Mister Clamp, is it true the building's been evacuated? 
 NE'SPERSON 2 Sir, is the building on fire? 
 No, no -- (signals firemen) That's a false alarm. We've just got some problems -- 
 3 Problems? You've got a guy in a Dracula costume in there, broadcasting stuff with little green monsters. Are you trying to panic New York City? CLAMP Ln Absolutely not. 1.10

 -- who is able to talk, and he's going to talk with us now. (to Brain Gremlin) I think the main question people have is -- what is it you want? The Brain Gremlin answers in his usual cultured tones, sounding lucid. 
 Fred, what we want is, I think, what everyone wants, and what you and your viewers have -- civilization, 
% building. Unnoticed by the Grem in SCENE outside the front doors of the building has changed. it now apa be RED SQUARE AT NIGHT, in the 1940s. 
 
 What's this thing for? 
 E These things can only come out when it's dark. We've put all the clocks in the building ahead three hours. When they think it's sunset...and they see what a nice "night" it is outside... they'll all be in the lobby, getting ready to come out. When they do, we drop this backdrop ...and let the sunlight fry 'em. 
 (indicates backdrop) Where'd you find this thing? 
 It's from a musical I was backing on Broadway. The one about Stalin. It closed last week. 
 Oh, I saw that. Boy, that guy could d c e. 
 -- Billy flails desperately, but it just leaves his mouth unprotected. Daffy wedges a CLAW in, moves in with the drill --- 
 MR. FUTTERMA 4 Billy! 
 MR. FUTTERMAN You okay, Billy? 
 MR. FUTTERMAN I knew you'd need help, kid. I wasn't gonna let you down. What's next? 
 -- KATE rounding the corner of the corridor, flashlight in hand. 
 Thank God you're here... 
 I could just leave you there. It seems to be good for your attitude. 
 Look -- about Billy. Nothing happened. Really. I asked him to go out to dinner with me, but it was just business. 40 Kate shakes her head, impatient. 
 MARLA (CONT.) Okay. Wait. I'm going to be honest with you. It'll be a cathartic openness thing. It wasn't business. I tried to get something going with him. But I couldn't get to first base. Does that help? 
 It'll do. She reaches into her purse, and pulls out a Swiss Army KNIFE. But as she starts cutting Marla down, Marla SEES something else, and SCREAMS -- 
 (V.0. ) To survive a war, you've got to become war. Holding the drawn bow and arrow in front of him, he PIVOTS on the display case, so that the match SCRATCHES against the wall, and CATCHES FIRE -- -- and, as Billy and Mr. Futterman round the corner, they SEE Gizmo loose the arrow -- -- which catches Spider-Mohawk in mid-body. The FLAMES spread over his body and to his hairy legs as he writhes, tumbles over, and DIES. Billy rushes to cut the women free with a pocket knife, as Mr. Futterman looks at Gizmo, up on the display case. 
 MR. FUTTERMAN What's that? 
 MR. FUTTERMAN (to Gizmo) Uh...thanks. Gizmo responds with a quick, Stallone-style nod, as Kate and Billy embrace. 
 Billy -- (indicates Gizmo) What happened to him? 
 I am now. 
 
 (thinks: huh?) Oh. 
 MR. FUTTERMAN We'll stop 'em, Billy. I'll tell you something -- ever since these guys attacked us, back in Kingston Fails, I've been scared it would happen again. But now that it happened...I'm_not seared. 
 MR. FUTTERMAN 
 (SHRUGS) Screwy, huh? But you know, Billy -- the most important part of "American" is those last four letters: "I Can." Washington didn't give up...Lincoln didn't give up -- 
 (suddenly, sharply) Please -- 
 MR. FUTTERMAN What's wrong? 
 I'm sorry, it's -- Lincoln's birthday. Something terrible happened on Lincoln's birthday one year, and ever since then... 
 Is everybody here? A CHEER of assent from the Gremlins. 
 ...it seems incredible, but following their bl _urdijnif rampage a destruction, these creatures are now mounting what appears to be a production number... 
 MR. FUTTERMAN Hey, these guys aren't bad -- 
 Billy, they're going to the doors... Billy points at the dark-glass WINDOWS over the lobby. 
 '4'°0 Sunlight? On the: unwelcome SOUND of a` THUNDERCLAP, 
 MR. FUTTERMAN If those guys get out there in the rain -- this town's going under for the third time. 
 Billy, we've got to do something. 
 MR. FUTTERMAN Into the lobby? Are you nuts? 
 Oh God -- I think so -- 
 Here -- Atpn't let him get wet. Does it bit From the box, Gizmo TWITTEje&entfully. 
 It's up to you, New York, New -- .but before he can open it, WATER splashes onto the lobby's doors, its windows, its floor... .and the Gremlins, delighted, turn to catch the spray. Their SKIN starts to BUBBLE. CAMERA finds miniature GREMLINS in the bubbles, as the lobby fills with the rising SMOKE AND LIGHT of Gremlin replication... 
 .tap into the PBX. .back through the voice mail module ...main switchboard... into the Ethernet... five-digit code -- 
... .as the threatened invasion of all New York becomes a sodden, viscous puddle of green, churning protoplasm that swamps the lobby... .and our heroes sigh with relief, their bodies untensing... 
 It's okay, guys. (surveys the goo) Maybe we can use this stuff as land fill... Grandpa Fred and Katsuji rush over to Clamp. 
 (into mike) We're here exclusively with -- Clamp waves Fred and Katsuji to a stop. Fred lowers the mike. 
 Excuse me there, pal. Who told you to go on my network with all that coverage today? 
 Um -- nobody, sir. It just -- seemed like news, and I.,. 
 Right. I'm making you an anchor. Six o'clock weeknights. 
 You're making me -- ? 
 I want you to go down to Barney's and see about some different clothes, though. This -- (indicates Dracula 
) This says to me, "Old World." Think about sweaters. Think avuncular. 
 Uh -- right. 
 Congrats° He turns his camera on Fred, and they start backing out of the building. 
 What does a men's wear makeover cost in Manhattan today? Join us, as we iny,estigate... 0 Billy and the othefs'c � off the stairs from the mezzanine, and go over to join Clamp. , 
 Bill, it looks like yob ,fled us out here... 
 Marla. You work for me, don't you? 
 Yes, sir. Very, very hard. Clamp nods, looks at her -- as if for the first time. Something promising passes between them... .as the doors to the building open, admitting Sheila Futterman and a small crowd of REPORTERS. Sheila sloshes hurriedly through the goo to Murray's side. 
 
 MR. FUTTERMAN They tried it again, Sheila. But we were ready for 'em. (to Billy and Kate) We're going home, guys. See you... The Futtermans exchange goodbye WAVES with Billy and Kate, and leave. The reporters latch onto Marla... 
 What happened here? 
 Oh, it was a complete nightmare disaster. We had to stop work completely... .as Billy and Kate commisserate with Clamp. 
 I'm not. 
 You're not? 
 For one thing, we're insured for the damage. For another...maybe it wasn't for people anyway. It was a place for things. You make a place for things... 
 (SHRUGS) .things come. 
 That's right. That's a good point. The sacrifice...you know, this could be good in my next book. I should be taking notes. You have any paper? 
 Wait a minute -- what's this? 
 That's Kingston Falls. 
 This is what I'm looking for. 
 I want to bu it. My new project, over in Jersey -- this is terrific! This is what people want now -- the traditional community thing. Quiet little towns! Back to the earth -- (indicates drawing) Is this your concept? 
 It's our home town. 
 That's even better! I love M1Q ! F M  00065 It's -- wait -- Clamp Corners! "Where life slows down to a crawl." What do you think? 
 It's terrific. 
 This is the kind of thing people need. Not talking elevators, just -- Bill, you sell me this design, and we'll build the biggest, most sensational quiet little town you've ever seen. 
 Of course, for Billy to do a whole 
 We can come to a deal. Believe me. Are you Mrs. Peltzer?

 A pleasure. 
 I saw on TV what was happening...' thought I'd come help you guys out. He takes out an AEROSOL CAN. 
 RAND (CONT.) Wish I'd finished this stuff a little sooner. 
 What is it? Rand indicates Gizmo, who's being held by Billy. 
 (holds up can) The Peltzer overcoat. in a Can. Personal waterproofing, for those who can not afford wetness. (to Gizmo) May I demonstrate? Gizmo looks at Rand, and nods somberly, Stallone-style. Billy holds him up, and Rand SPRAYS the chemical over his body. 
 RAND (CONT.} Boy, if I'd have finished this stuff a few days sooner, we could have saved everyone a lot of trouble. Kills you when that happens... He finishes spraying -- and takes out a WATER PISTOL. 
 RAND (CONT.) Observe. Everyone tenses as Rand aims the squirtgun at Gizmo -- 
-C Excuse me -- d e that stuff work 
 Sir, this'll work r k on just about anything. 
 How about construction crews? 
 No reason why not. 
 (to Billy and Kate) Excuse us a minute. 
 (to Billy and Kate) I'll call you guys -- Clamp leads Rand away, talking business... 
 CLAMP (CONT.) I f you knew what I was spending on tarps alone... 
 Is that right? 
 You understand him? Billy, surprised, realizes that he does. 
 Well, what did he say?

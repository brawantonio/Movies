 ROBERT G. DURANT the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth. As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black: 
 Now let's consider my points, one by one...

 Now, if everything goes according to plan, in a couple of months your nose will be on the lips of every American... He is feeding the prints into the input slot of a computer. 
 We've finally got the Imager working how we want it. 24 We pan to the Holographic Imaging Cylinder. The glass 24 cylinder, wired to the computer, glows to life. 24P A three dimensional holographic image of Yakatito's nose 24P rotates within. 25 Peyton glances from the Imager to the computer. He types 25 on the computer keyboard.

 On the right half of the screen, another image forms. It is a second molecule. Beneath it, the words: 
 
 The molecules rotate in synchronization. A loud beeping tone. Suddenly, the synthetic molecule begins to waver and spin randomly. 
 Fragmentation. Time? Yakitito checks his stopwatch. 
 Ninety-nine minute. Again. 
 ..Ninety-nine minute. Cells always break up at a ninety-nine minute. He punches away at a keyboard and takes the readout. 
 Electrolytes, temp and glucose concentration. all normal. 
 But still this ninety nine minute. Yakitito makes a notation of the time on a lab sheet. 
 Pacing, thinking; 
 Why? What is destabilizing it? Vivification process was cake. Tissue rejection? We licked that. We're close. We're smart guys. So why can't we make these cells stable? Hokay. Let's try a ten percent alkalinity. Get those suckers too drunk to fragment. 
 posts the completed lab sheet on a wall covered with hundreds of similar sheets. 
 We already try ten. He pokes at a section of lab sheets. 
 And twenty. And twenty-two... We try all phase of alkalinity. He punches the wall. CONTINUED 
 But still a ninety-nine minute! Three month ago, ninety nine minute. Ten month ago... ninety nine minute... BAM BAM... Yakitito punches the wall again and again. Peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly bobs. 
 A word of advice, Yakitito. Don't get emotionally involved. Watch. Analyze. Remain object ---

 Maybe I am lousy scientist.

 The answer, Yakitito. 
 snags the ball angrily from the air. 
 
 Go on! Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito flinches. 
 This means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are used. Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm now. He blinks. 
 Amazing. It work every time. 
 Mr. Strack, my name is Julie Hastings. I'm here from Pappas and Swain to represent you in the Von Hoffenstein negotiation. 
. How do you do? And please, call me Louis. This is my father who-- Strack Sr. interrupts his son's introduction.

 Gorson's tied up in litigation this week. Don't worry--I've done my homework.

 We want to be reasonable here. We said we were interested in selling the pier frontage and we are interested in selling. But frankly Mr. Von .will not be robbed. Seventy-five strikes us as a fair price for this parcel. We're ready to conclude a deal here and now at that price. 
 Then I guess we're only missing one element here. 
 What's that? 
 An interested party. Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile. Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful. He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie. He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods. Wine is poured around. 
 .Mr. Katz, I've found that in the real estate business, three factors determine a property's worth. CONTINUED 
 ...Location. Location. And... location. Frankly, you have none of the above. Your fair price is fair for midtown commercial, not for riverfront. 
 It's worth more to your client, given his plans for the area. 
 if my client can spin straw into gold, he'll still pay market price for straw. As a matter of fact-- 
 --Business is business. Deals vill come and go, but ze velt vill pause for a beautiful voman...and a fine wine. 
 Our offer stands at forty-eight. 
 Smiles a worldly smile. 
 Let us toast a zale at ze price of zixty millions. Strack Sr. smiles. He starts to raise his glass, preparing to toast. 
 To Von Hoffenstein: CONTINUED 
 You're moving in the right direction, but our offer stands firm. i believe if anyone had 
 .There's been a mistake. We ordered a bottle of '67 Beaujolais Maison Reme. Is that not correct? 
 Oui madame. '67 Beaujolais Maison Reme. Is what I have serve. Julie pleasantly but firmly corrects him. 
 No. You have served us a 1981 or 1982. California Beaujolais. 
 Please, Madame! I serve the Reme! 
. Mine tastes okay. 
 Ms. Hastings, please. The wine is fine. You're way out of your league here. I'm sure the wine steward-- 
 
 
 1982. 
 Please forgive us. We bring the bel Reme.at once. Gratis. Julie addresses the baron. 
 At any rate, our offer stands at forty-eight... As she rises: 
 .And if we can't toast, we prefer not to drink. These gentlemen and I have other business to attend to, so if you'll excuse us... Strack Sr. rises, angrily. He turns to leave with her, murmuring under his breath: 
. I told you to make this deal. Von Hoffenstein calls after them his wine glass held 
 Permit me, madame! Too fine a vine not to use for a toast! 
. How much did she pay you? 
 
. For that little trick with the labels. He takes the stewards fist in his and unfurls the steward's fingers. Revealing--A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL. Strack Jr. turns to Julie's retreating figure and smiles. 
! The fluid disappears from the bottom beaker and instantly reconstitutes in the top beaker as a steaming brown fluid. 
 .Time, Yakitito. 
 Ninety eight minute. A light goes out, leaving the lab in darkness except for the glow from the computer screen. 
 .Is a bulb. I get a fresh. 
 So, did you ask her? 
 Tonight. Out of habit, Peyton glances back to the microscope. 
 This is unbelievable! You been saying tonight for weeks and still you don't ask her! Maybe I ask to marry you. 
 Your father would never approve of me. Yakitito stares at him in puzzlement. Then:

 Please be seated. A spotlight SNAPS on, illuminating a chair behind her. Numbly, she sits in it. 
 ve. ow does it work? A Westlake Yanigita presentation. A smile spreads across Julie's face. 
 Love. Science is perplexed over this great mystery. Shot of Peyton and Yakitito in white lab coats, identical looks of perplexity on their, faces. Julie laughs. 
 What are the causes of love? How do we detect its presence? What are its effects? These are some of the questions we will investigate in this lesson. Again the sunset and distorted music. 
 Part one. je origins 21 ve. The sunset is replaced by split-screen photos of Peyton and Julie, age twelve. Peyton peers into a test-tube through glasses too big for his face. Julie assumes a mock-debonair pose for the camera. 
 These lovers first met on a seventh grade field trip to the planetarium... Shot of the night sky, rich with stars and galaxies. 
 While the narrator discussed the origins of the universe, Peyton held Julie's hand. Shot of a somewhat nerdy Peyton with his arm stiffly around Julie. 
 You were so slick. 
 Our test-subjects were soon--to use the jargon of teenagers--"going out. " This "going out" period can be as short as a single date, or as long as a lifetime. Montage of Peyton and Julie throughout the years. 
 In the case of these two--a rare phenomenon--it lasted twenty years. 
 Although we broke up sixteen times. Sunset and distorted music. 
 
 Part two. Mating rumpled bed, The sunset is replaced by a shot of Julie on a working on legal briefs, a camera-faced shadow crossing the image. 
 Certain objects develop a special, shared meaning to lovers. Here are some objects significant to our test subjects. Shot of coffee-rings on a table. 
 The coffee rings Peyton tends to leave. They irritate Julie, and he leaves them everywhere! Quick shots. Coffee rings on a lab report. Coffee rings on a book-shelf. Coffee rings on a wall and ceiling. Julie laughs. 
 Yet such minor irritations can strangely become endearing to the other mate. 
 Not just yet they haven't. The slide changes to a shot of a bottle covered in wax. 
 The bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne Julie gave Peyton for his twenty-first birthday. Now it serves as a candle holder. 
 I never gave you that. The champagne bottle is replaced by a shot of a record album turning on a player. The music plays over the image. Haunting. Romantic. 
 Finally, the single Love in the ark The song continues. Julie smiles, swept away by it. 
 This song was playing when the two first kissed. A high school prom picture comes up on the screen. Peyton in an awkwardly fitting tux and Julie, a blossoming beauty. In the slide, they have been caught kissing. 
 Now let us leave our test-subjects. The sunset again. ov in the Dark theme plays over it,. and eventually fades away. 
 Love. It's fundamental nature still eludes modern Science. Yet researchers across the globe continue to study this ancient and powerful phenomenon. Hoping one day, to unlock love's mystery. Credits come on. A Westlake/Yanagita Presentation. Etc. Peyton The lights in the lab come on. Julie turns around. steps out from behind the slide projector. 
 Pretty stupid, huh? 
 I thought it was beautiful- 
 Yakitito helped. I just wanted you to see it. It was just something I wanted you to. . know. 
 I know. Peyton wraps his arms about her. Julie moves close and they kiss. 
 .Dale Gorson, please... Peyton's hand enters with a mug of coffee, which he sets on the papers in front of her. 
 Peyton! Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo. Julie smiles at him. Then: 
 Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings... yes, I found some memos researching the Von Hoffenstein deal that I don't think I was supposed to find... From the late Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude Bellasarious. They're records of payments to various people on the zoning commission... Peyton, behind her, massages her back. 
 .They look like payoffs. Suspicious, at the very least... Well, the way I'd like to proceed is to talk to Strack's son first... Give him the benefit of the doubt. Under the circumstances, it's the least I can do. She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into his arms and closes her eyes blissfully. Reluctantly, she rises and slips on her shoes. Peyton watches her admiring everything about her. She gracefully lays her legal papers in her briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she turns to Peyton. 
 The sound of the closing door echos. He sits alone on the ksd, looking about the empty apartment and lab beyond. 
 In an impressive corporate power suit, briefcase in hand, walks briskl y down the sunny sidewalk, stopping at the intersection to sig nal a cab Suddenly, running up behind her.. 
 Julie, wait! She is opening the cab door when she turns to him. 
 What's the matter? 
 I've been thinking. Maybe we should get married. 
 Marriage--well, we could do that--of course, there's our careers--I men, I'm just starting to get things going at the firm. And, you know, I kind of like having my own 
 -- 
 'We're practically living together now. All marriage means is you answer the phone in the and if you to pretend grandmother, it's a wrong number. The poor woman's beginning to think she has alzheimer's. 
 
 Julie, I'm asking you to marry me. 
 He got a ring? 
 
 Ring? Oh, no, I don't have a ring. 
 
 (WHISPERS) He don't show much sense of commitment. 
 I mean, I just now finally 
 I love you, Peyton... She climbs into the cab, closes the door. 
 -Realized how much-- 
 (through the open 
) but I guess I'm not ready. 64 Julie leans close to kiss him, but the cab pulls into 64 traffic. 
 Watches Peyton grow smaller as the cab moves off. Julie looks longingly back at Peyton. Did she make the right choice? She back once more for Peyton but he is only a tiny dot in the distance. 
 STRACK'S VOICE Yes, go ahead, put a buy on the Kugerands... Thank you for your sympathy, Franz. He was a great man. And as long as Strack Industries flourishes my father lives on. The pull back shows Strack behind his power desk, talking nd Strack into the phone. waves the person on into his lush corporatecoffice 
 .Very good. Thank you. He hangs up. 
 .Miss Hastings. Have a seat. 
 Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Strack... I'm --sorry about your father. I heard last night. 
 My father was a great man, and his 
 (FAINT SMILE) Maison Reme 1967? 
 No thank you. Mr. Strack, I've been going over some documents and I came across something that puzzled me. It's a memo from your office to a Mr. Claude Bellasarious--it went out over your father's signature. It detailed 
-- Strack has gotten up to pace. 
 Yes yes, I know the memo. Julie continues, hesitantly: 
 ...It seems like the payments... were- 
 They were pay-offs. To the zoning commission. Bribes, to call a spade a spade. He gives her an appraising look. 
 .Does that shock you? 
 
 But it disappoints you. 
 Well it's hardly my place to-- 
 That's right, it's not your place. Yet I value your good opinion. 
 Surely you don't expect me to endorse it. 
 Course not. I'm sure my father never intended for you to know about it. I'm sorry if He's compromised you in any way. But I am asking you to understand. I'm not going to bore you with that old speech about how we all have to swim in the same pond. But you know as well as I that 
 STRACK (CONT'D) not so much as one mini-mall ever went up in this city without some grease being laid into the palms downtown. You're not naive; you know it's a cost of doing business. Ordinarily you don't have to face it. Well, I face it, and a lot worse, into acynic--that's the easy way out, and I'm tougher than that. Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of the Riverfront Development. 
 Take a look at that model, Julie. That was my father's dream. Now it's my dream. Acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay, thousands of jobs created, a building block--a very large building block--laid for the future. Not such a bad dream, as dreams go. And if the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore, well... 
 (BEAT) .the point is my father is well beyond the reach of the law, but that memo could embarrass Strack enterprises. 
 All right, you're point is well taken. But the fact remains that I'm in possession of evidence of the commission of a crime. You can no more ask me to destroy it than I could ask you to destroy one of your buildings. 
 Let me suggest this. You excuse yourself for a few minutes, go to the ladies' room, leaving your briefcase here. What happens to the memorandum while it's in my custody is my responsibility. 
 I wish it were that simple. First of all, I don't have the memo with me. Even if I did-- 
 It isn't safe to have that document. 
 Are you threatening me? 
 moves closer, touching her arm. 
 I'm trying to protect you. Does. (He hesitates, pursing st her.) his lips, wondering if he can tru Does the name Robert Durant mean anything to you? 
 He's an underworld figure-- racketeering, drugs. 
 
 
 Is that the most I can extract from you? 
 For now. 
 I believe it is. Well then, my dear, I'm in your hands. 
: The song IM IR =E DARE Haunting. Sad. As Julie listens, she becomes more and more affected. 
 #1 And you know he never said one bad word to that girl. He never done wrong by her. She's sure sorry now. He was a rare one. 
 #2 Well, you find someone who loves you, like Jim loved her, you shouldn't give 'em up so easy. 
 Time? 
 Ninety-six minute. A pause. 
 So, did you ask her? 
 
 This is unbelievable! Every day-- 
 Time, Yakitito. 
 It still ninety six minute! Sounds to me that maybe you didn't ask her. Maybe your afraid? 
 Look, I asked her. She said no, okay? Well, she actually said "I don't know". Peyton stands and stretches. The telephone rings, Peyton moves to answer it. 
 I'll get it. 
 please be there Peyton. 
 A Juts out of the shadows and clutches at Peyton's wrist!

 Didn't see you workin' out there. 
 Never found the guy's body, just an ear. Don't take long to bury that. Now sometimes when this happens folks'].]. be lookin' for a discount. But see, it ain't the diggin' that your payin' for, It's the real estate. They watch as... 
 The undifferentiated blue resolves itself, as a ripplin blue fluid, resembling the acid bath in Peyton's lab. A form emerges from it's depths; a completely bandaged head breaks the surface of the fluid. 
 Here we have a 25-30 year-old-male, no I.D., no medical history. Fished the guy out of the river with burns covering over forty percent of his body. His hands and.face were the most severe. 
 Ten years ago, pain from the burns would have been intolerable. The guy would have spent the rest of his screaming. Now we use the Rangeveritz technique; quite simply, we sever his spino-thalamic nerve... 
 .Here. Which, as you know, transmits neural-impulses of pain and vibratory sense to the brain. 
 No longer receiving impulses of pain, you stick him with a pin... 
 .and he can't even feel it. With a sharp practiced motion, he plucks out the pin. 
 Of course, there are serious emotional side effects to this operation. When the body ceases to feel, when so much sensory input is lost, the patient becomes alienated. The mind, cut off from its regular diet of input, has a never-satisfied thirst; alienation gives rise to loneliness, anger; uncontrolled rage is not uncommon. And the rage problem is exacerbated by the chemical effect of severing the nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow unchecked through body and brain-- giving him the strength of dozen men. Hence the leather restraints. The resident turns and heads for the door. The interns follow behind like ducklings. 
 Naturally, we give him every chance of recovery. He waves his hands about in futile circles letting the interns know that this is the party line. 
 .Remain optimistic... inspire confidence... Talk to him about rehabilitation potential... Personally? I give him a nine on the buzzard scale. 
 Code Blue, Burn Unit. All doctors report. Code Blue, Burn Unit.

 I haven't wanted to bother you during your period of grief, but I have to know whether you've come to a decision regarding the Belasarius Memorandum. 
 The decision's been made for both of us. The papers were destroyed in the fire. I want to forget all about that--

 DARKMAN/PAULY shrugs an exaggerated "haw-would-I-know?" Guzman is too angry to notice. 
 Durant piss me off. How de hell should we know where Rick is? What are we, de baby-sitter? He places the briefcase on the floor and is about to slide it across, but hesitates. He eyes Darkman/Pauly suspiciously. 
 You okay, Pauly? You looking funny. 
 DARXMAN/PAULY shrugs, reaches into his pocket, pulls out a bottle of Maalox, and takes a slug. Guzman slides the briefcase across the floor to Darkman/Pauly. Darkman/Pauly, without saying a word, takes the briefcase and exits.

 Yes. Once upon a time. Married and in love -- deeply, deeply in love...

 GUZMAN'S VOICE Jew want me to be at your place ... around 8:30? 
 DURANT'S VOICE That would be just fine for me. We are tracking off the cassette up a long cord that leads to a pair of headsets worn by Darkman. His eyes glisten through the slits of his bandages. A set of hands enter frame and crack him viciously across the head. He sprawls backward, caught off guard.

 DARE 4AN contorts his face into a ghastly interpretation of a smile, and slips back into the shadows. 
 But why do you have to stay at this burn center? You can stay at my place now. 
 
 
 Peyton, I still don't understand. Why didn't you come back to see me before now? 
 Well... it's like I told you. The burns left some scars and... I was ashamed. Afraid. I was afraid that you wouldn't want me anymore. 
 Of course I still want you. 
 But...what if I was...burned. So horribly burned, that you couldn't stand to look at me. Couldn't stand to have me touch you. What then? 
 Well...if that were the case... I don't know. But why even ask me that? The point is: You're fine. Your back. Just like always. She smiles. Peyton is filled with the warmth of being accepted and wanted once again. 
 Yeah. I am back, aren't I? Just like always. 
 DURANT'S VOICE That would be just fine for me. 
 DURANT'S VOICE That would be just fine for me. We pan past the back of the Darkman's head. The - bandages have been removed. Although his face is not visible, the singed hairless back of his skull is. It is not a pretty sight. 
 DURANT'S VOICE That would be just fine for me. The Darkman switches off the desk lamp and removes a mask from a black lightproof bag. He examines it, returns the mask to the bag, then slips it into his coat. The camera arcs around to see the bottom half of his skeletal face. 
 DURANT'S VOICE That would be... CLICK--the Darkman stops the tape mid-sentence and his own hideously charred mandible finishes it: 
 ..just fine for me. 
 Wanna bag for that? 
 That would be just fine for me. 292 The clerk bags the pizzas as Durant pulls out a 292 revolver from his suit coat. The clerk takes a Fearful step back.

 How I regret having to burden you with my miserable difficulties! I have no money! The Darkman's eyes shift. He was not expecting this. Hung Fat is waiting for an explosion. There is none. Sensing an advantage, he presses on.

 Studies the Darkman hard. How can he tolerate this? 
 And of all your unworthy servants, Hung Fat is the most destitute... As if in response to some silent signal, four enormous and muscular Chinese men enter and stand, arms crossed, in a threatening posture. Even Hung Fat's own minable slaves sometimes ignore his wishes, and attack those people whom Hung Fat cherishes most deeply! Wahbuht, they know nothing of our golden friendship!

 No. Take a fucking squad of marines with you!

 watches Durant and Guzman disappear down the tunnel. The sound of their footsteps recedes. Trumayne's breathing is shallow. He loosens his necktie and unbuttons his collar. He takes a breath.

Crunching on gravel; Approaching. He fingers the gun's trigger. Empty tunnels on all sides. The FOOTSTEPS quicken. 
 Mr. Durant?! Panicked, Trumayne shines his light in front of him. Empty tunnel. The FOOTSTEPS come faster, closer.

 ..,: B318 D For the first time, we see the complete nightmare. Only the uppw right quarter of Peyton's face remains intact. Perfect., Handsome. But as for the rest... The 3i,a is a hairless skull, covered with random bits of scaranf char. Without the benefit of gums or lips, the entire 3ength of his teeth are exposed down to the root, connec g crookedly to the jaw bone. One ear remains intact, the other a burnt hole. Only the rudimentary cartile forms the nose. But it is the wild eyeballs protruig obscenely from the bone of their sockets, that tell tba,story. There, lies madness; a dark river of evil rage. 
 GUZMAN'S EYES look like saucers. 
 even looks a little scared. 
 Oh shit, man. What did he do, man... eat him? From the tunnel ahead, FOOTSTEPS approach. The two men squint, attempting to pierce the blackness. 
 Trumayne?! The FOOTSTEPS grow louder. Closer.

 The long subway train rolls into the distance. It's rumble fades. Quiet. Durant's cigar smoulders on the tracks. 
 
 We cut from Darkman's ravaged monster-face to:

 (INTENSE) Can I--can I see you? CLINK! The bullet is dislodged from the wound and drops on the table. 
 laughing, his face restored, walking down the midway, one arm draped over Julie's shoulder. She laughs with him. Peyton glances at his watch. 
 Put away that watch or I'll think you don't like me anymore. Oh, Peyton, let's spend the whole day together -- the whole week! A beat. 
 I've got to tell you, Julie... I've got to tell you something about -- about me -- how I've changed. Julie turns. 
 In the fire -- I -- I A voice offscreen rises above the general noise: 
 VOICE (OS) See the mutant man, half man, half beast! Witness this prodigy of science with your own eyes! Peyton whirls around. 
 What? 
 
 What's going on, Peyton? What are you keeping from me? 
 
 Why do you always have to run? Peyton looks at the pyramid, avoiding her look. He throws the first ball; misses. - 
 I. have my treatment... I'm not a hundred percent cured yet--but I soon will be. He throws the second ball; misses. 
 Can I take you back to the burn center? Peyton's vein begins to throb faintly. 
 No! No, please. I don't want you to see me there. I don't want you to think of me as...an invalid or... some kind of f--ff-fff--FREAK! On that word he throws the last ball with great force. The pyramid explodes. Peyton, breathing heavily, takes a moment to collect himself, then says quietly to the booth attendant: 
 ...The pink elephant, please. The bored attendant, a cigarette dangling from his lower lip, shakes his head. 
 Sorry buddy. It don't count if you ain't standing behind that line. 
 I was behind the line. 
 Not hardly. 
 I was standing right here. Next to my girlfriend. Now. The pink elephant, .if you please! 
 Na way. Julie tugs at his sleeve. 
 Peyton, it doesn't matter. Peyton is fighting to contain his rage. in clipped words, between gasps for breath: 
 It matters. I won a pink elephant. For my girlfriend. 
 Peyton... It's okay... 
 Get lost, buddy. 
 The elephant... Quickly! The attendant unwisely pushes two fingers into Peyton's chest. We rocket into a close shot of the offending digits. From of fscreen, we hear the attendant's voice: 
 You heard me, weirdo. Get lost! 
 Screaming. A skin blister bubbles on his cheek. 
 Take it! 
 Peyton! No! 
 'Take it! 
 Please! 
 
 Forgive me! He runs off, the fuzzy pink elephant still clasped, forgotten, beneath one arm.

 Julie, how sweet of you to come before our appointed hour... but I expected-- you in something a little more formal. Didn't Ruth inform you that we have tickets to Der Fliedermause tonight? 
 I can't go, Louis. We have to talk. 
 Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy? 
 Thank you, no. 
 I'll have one;_ As he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink. 
 ...Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and it's quite good-- 
 Louis, I can't see you anymore. 
 Darling, settle down. Don't be rash. As you say, let's talk. 
 You know about Peyton, the man I was 
 
 Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was burned, horribly, horribly burned--I don't understand what happened but I know he needs my help. Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy down. 
 .Your news has a bittersweet flavor... Of course I'm very happy for you. If there's anything I can do-- the finest medical care can be at your disposal--burn therapy, recon- structive surgery. How badly was he... mutilated? Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's sofa, her body wracked with sobs. 
 ... Where is he, Julie? 
 He's living in an abandoned warehouse. He's alone... he needs me. The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks it up. 
 Not now!... Who?... All right, I'll take it in the other room. He looks up at Julie. 
 I won't be a moment. He walks into an adjoining room. He picks up the phone. 
 Yes, Franz... And the closing price?... 
 She reaches for a tissue. Next to it is. 
 Strack's briefcase sitting on top of his desk. 
 Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves closer. 
 STRACK (OS) I feel sufficiently diversified... Franz, it is immaterial to me what the market is doing. I want you to buy... 
 JULIE'S POV A sheaf of papers stick up above the mouth of the briefcase. 
 STRACK (OS) Yes, you did hear me correctly. I want you to buy. Ten thousand Krugerands. Fresh ones! 
 STRACK'S VOICE Yes. The Belasarious memorandum. 
 whirls to face him. He stands looking down over her shoulder. 
 .I'm sorry you had to find that, dear. Our relationship didn't need this further strain. 
 The fire... it wasn't an accident, it was you. 
 Not me personally. I have an employee who does certain things for me, unofficially, off the books. Robert doesn't like to pay taxes. 
 
 Hardly. You have nothing on me, my dear, and you'd find the extremely expensive police department quite unsympathetic. (A beat). Julie. Consider the big picture. 
 I suppose this is goodbye then. Julie stares hatefully at him for a beat, then hurries out the door. 
 Send Robert in. Strack strolls over to the window and stares out at his rising city. OS the door clicks open. 
 ROBERT G. DURANT enters the room. 
 I Robert! I have good news and bad. 
 Custom dictates that you render the bad news first. 
 You recall the little difficulty with my father and how you resolved it. We have a similar situation with Miss Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has uncovered some unflattering information about us. 
 No problem at all. And the good news? 
 Your wife died. I'm joking, of course. No, the good news is that I know who's behind our little troubles of late. When you retrieved my memorandum, you failed to excise the good doctor. 
 Westlake? He's dead. I saw to it myself. 
 He's alive. I don't like loose ends, Robert. Finish it. 
 Okay. Where is he? Strack smiles.

 Guzman, come in! Smiley! Guzman! What the fuck is going on down there?! A burst of STATIC. Then: 
 DARKMAN' S VOICE I am. Durant drops the walkee-talkee as if it were something hot. 
 
) Take her down! 
 I want that son of a bitch eliminated! And I don't want his fingers, I want his fucking head! 
 DARKMAN'S VOICE 
 (EVIL RASP) You're next. 
 Where are you?! Pilot.and Durant look toward the entrance of the warehouse. The door is closed. Suddenly... 
 
 
 is yanked from his feet. 
 - 421 421 His overcoat flapping as he somersaults down, he throws out one arm and... 
 B426 B426 is barely able to hold onto the ladder. Below him, P426 the tiny city is a spinning blur of metal and asphalt and P426 glass. 
 
 A The executives stare in shock at the Darkman standing on their table. 
 DARKMAN'S POV The faces of the executives whirling in a circle like numbers on a roulette wheel. 
 Dip him! 
 
 
 P442 Wind whipping at his coat, looking up at the doomed helicopter, the Darkman bellows in triumph. 
 P443 taking up the entire screen. --impact--KABOOM! 
 P444 
: 
 We've consolidated the waterfront, Governor ...Yes, I'm aware there's been some unpleasantness but that's over now. Yes, I'm sure. You sound a little nervous, Bryant. Have a brandy, watch a cop show. The door opens. A security officer appears. 
 Robert Durant, sir. 
 
 (TO PHONE) Goodbye, Governor. Everything's taken care of. He hangs up. We hear the door open and close. Strack's smile vanishes. 
 enters. He looks awful--face scorched and bruised, severe limp. 
 You look like hell, Robert. 
 The son of a bitch malfunctioned my helicopter. 
 And Westlake? 
 'f ie man's a cockroach. You think you ;tall him, and he pops up someplace , Ise. A beat. 
 g expect he'll pop up here soon. 
 (PRESSES INTERCOM) if Westlake calls, kindly refer him to Strack Towers. 
 I'm glad you survived, Robert. I'd hate to see your kids deprived of a role-model. 
 They do look up to me. The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge. The lights of the city tremble over the water. A glitter and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur. 
 Kids need an example, Robert. When I was a young man my father made me work high steel. That's how he started out, and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me... 
 ...It was just me and the Indians, no one else crazy enough to run around up here, against the wind, four-fifty an hour. Sure I resented it, but now-- call me crazy--sometimes I miss it, it sharpens your wits. Life on the edge. Five inches wide. Two hundred fifty feet down. High steel... He turns to face Durant. There's a gun in his hand. 
 You don't have any kids, Robert. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Or should I say, Doctor Westlake? 
 I'm Durant! Robert G. Durant! 
 Then I'm going to make a mistake. There's a long beat. The vein begins to pulse on Durant's temple. His eyes grow predatory, evil. 
 DURANT/ DARMAN 
 (RASPS) Where's the girl? Strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder. He smiles back over his shoulder. 
 You want to see the girl? Follow me, I'll take you to her... Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative steps. 
 P4463?D(2) 
 ...I must say, Dr. Westlake, you've certainly worked some mischief. Pretty much wiped out the security arm of Strack Industries. That's okay. I'm a good sport... He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following cautiously behind. 
 ...And I can handle my own problems. I do whatever I have to do. In fact, that's how I got my first properties. My wife--late wife--held certain deeds... I sent her on a plane trip over the Smokies and well, let's just say ;landed on My feet... 
 (SHRUGS) .as for my father, well, he was old, I spared him a few miserable years... Yes, we all have dreams, Dr. Westlake, but we don't all have what it takes to realize those dreams. 
 DURANT/DARKMAN All I have are nightmares. A beat. 
 Then share my dream. After all, you and I are pretty much the same. We should be working together. Both smart fellows. Similar styles. Same taste in women. I could use a man like you. 
 (RASPS) Go to hell. 
 Eventually, eventually... He proceeds nimbly along the beam. 
 I guess you just don't have what it takes. I gather you run around wearing other people's faces now, since yours is so... loathsome. He shrugs. 
 .See I could never do that. The world has to take me as I am. And all this tit-for- tat stuff you've been up to. Silly. Living in the past. ; only destroy to build something better, whereas You..• ah, here we are. 
 DURANT/DARKMAN Julie! Strack laughs. 
 Bring on the strings! Young lovers! In peril! Separated by ruthless forces, larger than they!--What a banal tale. In it, I suppose I play the villain. But wait, Julie--which of us is the monster here?! With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!! -- tears his face off, tossing it over the edge.. 
 STR.ACK You truly are one ugly son of a bitch. 
! Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder, hurling him off the bean. The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing with rage. 
 As Darkman's fingertips clamp onto the upper lip of an I-beam... barely hanging on, vein pulsing. 
 recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He touches her hair. 
 
 (WITH REMORSE) First my wife, then my father, and now 
 -It is the tragedy of my life that I always have to kill the ones I love. As he's about to push her: 
. Father? 
. 
 (HORRIBLE RASP) I should've snuffed you out at birth! With that Strack Sr. rips off his own face, exposing the enraged visage of Darkman... Strack reaches for his gun. 
 A only a few inches from his grasp. 
 swoops onto Strack, pummelling him. 
 STRACR'S HAND inching painfully toward the rivet gun. 
 pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge. He steps back to give a final blow... .and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance. 
 lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical bar. 
! Z ! 
 Now you get to watch your girl-friend die. He moves toward a terrified Julie. 
 SHRIEKS and reality melts around him as he tastes the hot soup of rage. 
 pounces. He lifts him full into the air. Strack's legs and arms flail impotently. 
 
 ! Darkman hurls him up, up into the air. 463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins 463 to fall, yards away from the girder. 464 He spins, end over end, to--PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!--be impaled 464 on the rebars many floors below, next to Durant's face. 
 Peyton, I can help. 
 No one can help. 
 I don't care how you look, Peyton! I. love you. The burns don't matter. There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in close-up. CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level. 
 Take my hand. Julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers. She overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his. 
 It disgusts you. 
 No. Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn. 
 This hand... it used to caress you. Now it can only tear, rip away at things. 
 
) But you'll perfect the skin. You'll get rid of the scars. 
 It's not just the scars. I've changed- He grips his skull. 
 --inside. He pulls the elevator open. 
 
 (BEAT) I can live with it now, but I don't think anyone else can. 
 (tears in her 
) I want it back. The two of us--the way it was... Darkman's voice breaks: 
 What we had--our life together--it belonged in the light of day. He disappears into the darkness. 
 Peyton! Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away: 
 Peyton is gone... 466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466 he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a construction trailer. A pedestrian reappears on the other side. Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he slips into the pedestrian traffic. The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she desperately searches for him, turning people around, staring at their faces... It begins to snow. 
 Peyton! She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into alien faces in search of the man she loves.

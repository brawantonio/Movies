 WINK (CONT'D) You don't talk! 
 This side is still Wink's house. No toys, and no girl stuff over here. 
 WINK (CONT'D) So if I want to come over that side and smack you in the face, that's against the rules. So there's a plus for you. 23

 Yo Winston? 
 (O.S.) Edison? Ow-Wee! 
 Some day when I'm gone, you gonna be the last man in the bathtub. You have to learn how to feed your house. 
 WINK (CONT'D) Now, stick your left hand in this water, stick it in there. 
 WINK (CONT'D) Ok, what you do is you hold your hand steady and you just wait for your fish to come. You gotta ball your fist up, this is your punching hand. Ball your fist up in case you have to whack it when they come up. 
 WINK (CONT'D) WHOOOOO YEA! Whooo lord, look what we got. I gotcha. Say "I gotcha!" 
 Yea! Hold him down! Now, you hold it down like this, and whack him good with your fist.

 (re: Peter T) That is one classic dude right there. 
 Peter T, you are a titan! Glad you stayed man! RHHAAAA! 31 
 If I had wings, I know I could have flown in that bad boy. But I would have probably bounced off a tree, or... 
 Hushpuppy! Did I ever tell you the story of your conception? 
 WINK (CONT'D) When me and Hushpuppy's Mamma first met we was so shy, we used to sit around, and drink beer, and smile at each other. One day we was so shy we just napped... 
 (V.O.) Your Momma battered that gator up, and set it to fry. 
 ...and Hushpuppy popped into the universe maybe four minutes later. 
 WINK (CONT'D) I got it under control. 
. 
 Come on lets go! Time to eat! Come on children, feed up time! 
 To the last of the food! 
 To the last of the water! 
 You ain't drinkin' no water. 
 Yea, tastes like more, alright! 
 When the water goes down, I'm gonna French kiss the dirt! 
 Water's not goin' down man. 
 Nah, that's my beautiful place under there. 
 Man you know they got plenty of salt coming into that water, everything beautiful is gone. Trees are gonna dies first, then the animals, then the fish. 
 I got it under control. 36

 WINK (CONT'D) Just sit here I'll be right back.

 Walrus, don't make me slap your ass! They go to the levee!?

 WINK (CONT'D) (CHOKING UP) No crying, you hear? 
 T As I stand by the bayou, 
 A ship at my side starts her motors and sails for the gulf. I watch her until she disappears. "There! (MORE) 75 
 EVERYONE (CONT'D) She's gone!" Gone where? Gone from my eyes, that's all. She's just as big as when she left me. And somewhere else, other voices are calling out, "Here she comes!" And that is dying. 
 EVERYONE (CONT'D)

 (V.O.) (on TV) Eliminating the draft? Worst thing ever happened to pro football. Already you got Eric Dickerson, no team's good enough for him... You got Dion Sanders, this guy, Bosworth, bunch of peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him play for 25 bucks a game. And he woulda played for free, you get me? He loved the game. Nowadays? Forget about it. The TELEPHONE SHRILLS in the stillness. The Man On the Bed answers it. Speaks haltingly. MAN ON BED Hello...? 
 (V.O.) Hello, Billy.    Do you know who this is? Silence. 
 (V.O.) Kid from Ohio is looking real good, Billie... The Man's hand unclenches. A container of pills spills over the blanket. He stammers: MAN ON BED I'm... I'm gonna... try real hard... 
 (V.O.) No, Billy. What you're gonna do ... is rush for 150 yards against Chicago. MAN ON BED That's... too much. I can't... (CONTINUED) 
 (V.O.) You can. And you  will. This is a business, Billy.  You don't make one fifty, you're history, the kid steps in. No more  job... and no more pills, Billy. MAN ON BED Please... Just give me time... 
 (V.O.) One hundred and fifty yards. Goodbye. The PHONE CLICKS off. NFL running back Billy Cole stares straight ahead, mouth working spastically. CUT TO: 
 Good afternoon and welcome to Soldier Field, Chicago, site of today's confrontation between the L.A. Stallions and the Chicago Bears. This is Vern Lindquist with Terry Bradshaw, and, yes, my friends, it is that cold. 
 (V.O.) ... Big Ray Walton puts a devastating hit on Bricmont, so Chicago turns over the ball with a minute and forty seconds left. 
 (V.O.) And so L.A. has a chance to ice the game, no pun intended... And you gotta be thinking, give the ball to Billy Cole. He has had an outstanding day, racking up 138 yards against a tough defense. 
 are on the field now. Running full out. They've got riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the snow. Cole crosses the goal line.   Touchdown. Drops the ball. Turns, facing the cops.   His eyes are insane. The crowd is screaming. People are running back and forth like extras in the Keystone Cops. The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost. The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice. Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him.    He smiles and says: (CONTINUED) 
 I'm going to Disneyland... Puts the GUN to his helmet.   FIRES. CUT TO: 
. On the lawn, a late-model Plymouth. The sprinkers come to life. Fling water across the car. 
 Inside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo. Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music. Picture the  tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch self-hating  loser you can. Now give him  a two-year-old suit from C & R Clothing. Such is the  aforementioned HALLENBECK. 
 THREE neighborhood KIDS have gathered around the car. Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk. One tosses a baseball from hand to hand. One picks his nose. (CONTINUED) 
 #1 Dude's trashed. 
 #2 Shit, we should do something to him. Kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs.   It looks like his entire fist is up there. Pause, then: 
 #3 I know where there's a dead squirrel. 
 #1 Do it. They heave the squirrel into the car and run away. A pause. Another pause.    The sprinkler goes round. Nothing happens. 
 Hallenbeck snores. The mashed squirrel perches on his chest. A shadow falls across him as -- 
 return, scratching their heads.   Staring in at him. 
 #2 Goddamn.   Dude's trashed. 
 #3 Take his bottle. Kid #1 smiles nervously.   Reaches in with infinite patience. Trembling hand inches closer and closer -- And closes on the bottle as, without warning -- 
 sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38 revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it. 
 Hey, motherfucker. The Kid, of course, shrieks. And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes. He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid. Swears under his breath. Watches    the boys flee in terror. Notices a dead squirrel    in his lap. Scowls. Heaves it out the window. Pumps    a Camel into his mouth. Lights it. Rescues the bottle of    Seagrams. 
 #3 I'm not scared. Hallenbeck scowls. 
 You're on my property, kid. 
 #3 Sidewalk belongs to the government. Hallenbeck stares at him.   Smiles weakly. 
 Excuse me. He leans over and vomits on the lawn. One hand gripping the car fender. The sprinkler goes round and round. 
 where a tawny golden girl lies, serene and innocent. Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast exposed. No tan line. The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the sleeping girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old, former National League heartthrob. He shakes his head and mutters: JIMMY (YOUNG MAN) Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so damn ugly. He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it up a nostril. For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror. FLASH CUT TO: 
 JIMMY'S FACE Covered with dirt and mud. Blood, too. Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he's alive. He makes a difference. 
 (O.S.) Jimmy, are you still here...? Pause, then: 
 I don't know. He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes. 
 Yeah.    I guess I am. He sniffs, clearing his nose. 
 Hallenbeck Investigations. (CONTINUED) 
 (V.O.) Hey, Joe, Mike Miller over at Swerdlow. You got a minute? 
 Mmmmm. 
 (V.O.) Mmmmm? What's mmmmm? Jeez, you sound fucking terrific. What'd you do last night? 
 Sat in the car. Looked at the sky. Got hammered. 
 (V.O.) How bad? 
 I killed a squirrel and don't even remember. 
 (V.O.) That's bad, Joe. 
 Tell me about it. Look, I crawled out of a perfectly good bottle to answer the phone, what the fuck do you want? 
 (V.O.) Still takin' charity? 
 No pride here. What'cha got? 
 (V.O.) Stripper in West Hollywood. Lives alone. Very hot. A three on my finger scale. Means I'd cut off three of my fingers if God would let me sleep with her. 
 Make her a one on your nose scale. Improve your looks. 
 (V.O.) Eat me. Deal is this: She's got a psycho, threatens her over the phone. I'm gonna rape you, cut you, the usual crap. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 MALE (V.O.) (CONT'D) She thinks he's following her. I'm up to here, you got plans? 
 I was gonna smoke some cigarettes. 
 (V.O.) Can you postpone? 
 These are really good cigarettes. 
 (V.O.) She goes onstage at seven.    It's two hundred bucks, Joe. 
 (sighs) Gimmee the address. 
 (V.O.) Terrific.    And, Joe, big favor, okay? Try    to... fix yourself up, if you can   manage it. Look the part. Not    like the last time, okay? Hallenbeck catches his reflection in the mirror over the TV. His face is ashen grey. Hollow eye sockets. Blotchy skin. 
 Gimmee the address. 
 'Morning, gorgeous. Gorgeous does not respond:   Coy.   Very coy. Hallenbeck slides behind the wheel of his Plymouth.     KEYS the IGNITION. Phil Woods' SAXOPHONE fills the air.      He looks at himself in the mirror. (CONTINUED) 
 (softly) Nobody likes you. Everybody hates you. You're an asshole and you're stupid. You're gonna lose. (pause) Smile, you fuck. He stretches his mouth into a grimace. Pulls out into the street. Off he goes. CUT TO: 
 'Morning, boys. They all grunt. One of them, name of HENRY, looks up at him. Holds out a half-smoked doobie: 
 Hey, Jimmy.   You want some of this? 
 No, man. Why do you think they call it dope? (beat) Henry, did I do anything last night that I should know about? 
 You puked a couple times. Pointed at some lady's tits. Chased a dog for a half an hour. Fucked a congressman's daughter, shit on someone's car. 
 No, man, I meant something bad, that I should know about. (CONTINUED) 
 Mmmm.  Nope. (frowns) My ass hurts, I think I had gay sex last night. I don't remember. When are you gonna come look at my gun collection? 
 Soon, Henry. One of the other PLAYERS looks up, says: 
 Are you Jimmy Dix? Played for the Stallions? 
 '86 and '87, that was me. 
 Hell, I think the league gave you a raw deal. 
 Thanks.   What the hell, shit floats.   I'll be back. 
 I hope so. 
 I'll be back. Everyone plays cards.    No one looks at him.   He frowns. Leaves. 
 Ho.    Ray. The MAN looks up, annoyed. 
 RAY (MAN) What the fuck you want, Jimmy? 
 What's with the girl? She surfaces, sputtering and screaming.   Ray thrusts her beneath the surface again. 
 Bitch won't blow me. 
 (pause, then) Too early in the morning, Ray. Let her go. 
 Fuck you. She's not coming up till she starts blowing. Jimmy swallows hard.   Says: 
 Ray.   Let her go. 
 Fuck   you, loser. What are you doing at a   league party, asshole? You and ol'   Dex Manley should get together, swap   stories about gettin' booted. 
 Ray, she's gonna drown. 
 Not if she blows me. Jimmy's eyes are smoldering. He steps to the right. Casually scoops up a football lying on the deck. 
 Last chance, Ray. 
 Go spit. (CONTINUED) 
 Fine. Jimmy turns, as if to walk away. Instead, he spins back and launches the football. It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the ball. The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose. The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking. Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the water. 
 Get out of here. Go. She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair. The guy is bleeding. Delirious. Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart. 
 Best arm in the National League, you son of a bitch. Remember that. He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious. The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside. 
 'Morning, Joe, how's it going? 
 My ears are burning, Andy. Even as we speak, someone, somewhere is calling me an asshole. 
 You're funny. 
 I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th. 
. 
 I thought you were in Las Vegas. 
 I was. 
 Where did you sleep? 
 Office. He brushes past her and crosses to the bed.   On the pillow, a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly. 
 Hey, Furry Tom. He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night stand and removes a speedloader for his .38. Starts to load the gun. 
 How much did you lose? 
 I wasn't there to gamble.    I was doing a skip trace. 
 How much did you lose? 
 Fifty bucks. He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand. A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns: 
 What's this? 
 Darian's class drew holiday pictures. That was hers. Her teacher wants to see us, Joe. 
 Satan Claus. Kid's got some talent, don't you think? 
 It's hideous. 
 You okay, Sarah...? 
 I'm tense. I couldn't get to sleep last night. 
 Hmmmm. Well, I think the kid will be fine. Boys still tease her about the headgear? 
 Are you kidding? Brace Face, that's the latest. Little bastards. 
 (under his breath) She'll be fucking them by the time she's fourteen. 
 Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe. 
 Well, Christ, you let her wear enough makeup. The kid looks like a goddamn raccoon. She comes in late at night, I think, 'Christ, a burglar.' I almost shot her twice. 
 You're not funny. All the girls at that school wear makeup. (CONTINUED) 
 Yeah, but they don't apply it with a paint sprayer. And for your information, our neighbors think I'm very funny. 
 Go live with them. 
 Don't tempt me. He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed.   Stalks into the bathroom. 
 Damn raccoon. He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet. Walks back out into the bedroom. 
 Who's the guy in the closet? Sarah stops dead.   Spins and stares at him. 
 Excuse me? 
 (frowns) Oh, that's right, you sometimes forget that I'm a detective. (lights a cigarette) See, first I noticed how tense you were, but I let that pass. Then I noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was just in there, but meanwhile your hair is completely dry, you follow? So. Why the steamy shower? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 HALLENBECK (CONT'D) Because someone else was in there, right, and since he's not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door a day early. Tah-dah. Please, no applause. A silence hangs between them.    Sarah just stares.   Shakes her head. 
 Well, nothing changes.    You're still a lunatic. 
 Mmmmm. I'm sorry, honey, I don't enjoy being observant, but someone's gotta do it. (beat) What's his name? 
 Please leave.    I have to get dressed. 
 It's okay, I've seen you naked. So, apparently, has someone else. What's his name? 
 You want me to open the closet, Joe? Huh? You want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, I'll throw the door open, is that what you want me to do...? 
 Is this a trick question? 
 I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want? Huh?? An awkward pause.   Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says: 
 No.   We won't open the door. 
 Thank you. (CONTINUED) 
 (sighs) Nope. Door stays shut. Instead, what I'm gonna do is... (he scoops up the .38) ... I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna put a bullet in there, and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth. One. 
 If you shoot up my house, Joe, I will make you eat that gun. 
 Two. The truth is a beautiful thing. He cocks the hammer.   Arm extended, hand rock steady. 
 Call your shrink, Joe. I still have the number. Call him and tell him you're losing it, I cannot fucking deal with you like this -- ! 
 Three.   Last chance. 
 Joe, dammit -- ! He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger.    And Sarah screams -- 
 Jesus, no -- ! And grabs the gun. Everything freezes. She looks at him.    He looks at her. Understanding occurs. 
 swings slowly open, then... And out steps a man in a bathrobe. Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet. None other than MIKE MILLER, Joe's early morning phone call. We know this because Joe says: (CONTINUED) 
 Hello, Mike.   Keeping her warm for me? The gun barrel does not waver.    Not an inch. 
 Easy, Joe.   Don't do nothing dumb. 
 How as she, Mike? On your finger scale, how was my wife...? 
 It just happened, Joe.     It just happened. 
 You call me from here this morning? 
 She said you were in Vegas. I was gonna leave a message on the machine. 
 When you found out I was back.       Why didn't you split? 
 She said relax, he never stops home once he's in the office. 
 Normally I wouldn't. 
 (stares at him) You knew? 
 I suspected. So how about it, Mike? On a scale of one to ten. How was she? 
 Joe, come on, how long we been friends, huh? 
 How long? Mmm. I'd say roughly until you put your dick in my wife. (CONTINUED) 
 You gotta understand -- 
 I know, I know, it just happened. It was an accident. Sure. You tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife. Gee, Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my week. Sure, Mike. Happen to anybody. (beat) I don't gotta understand anything. Sarah speaks then.   Head down.   Eyes averted. 
 Put the gun down. 
 Hmmm?  Oh, right, the gun. (sighs) You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts. He pulls the trigger. The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room. Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself. The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head. On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead center. Blows it to pieces. Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor. Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless eyes. 
 Where was Darian? 
 She stayed at Cindy's last night. He nods.   Turns and waves the gun at Miller. 
 Let's take a walk, Buddy. 
 Where you want it, Mike?     Head or gut? 
 Listen, Joe, I -- (stops, sighs) Gut. Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's gut. Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch. Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it. 
 If I see you again, I'll kill you. Miller nods weakly.    Gasping for breath. 
 So.   West Hollywood at seven, right? 
 Huh...? 
 The job.     Seven o'clock, right? 
 You still... want the job...? 
 It's two hundred bucks. 
 Yeah.   I guess it is. He climbs to his feet, still doubled over. 
 I'm sorry, Joe. (CONTINUED) 
 Why did Mr. Miller visit your home this morning, Mr. Hallenbeck? Joe lies easily: (CONTINUED) 
 He came by to talk business. He had a case he was to busy to continue with, a routine surveillance. He farmed it out to me. 
 I see.    Is that all you talked about? 
 Yeah.    That's all. He looks the Officer in the eye.      Betrays nothing. 
 EMCEE (BEANPOLE) Flash of green buys a flash of pink, gentlemen. So reach into your pockets if you aren't there already, and reward the lovely and talented Ms. Vixen...! The black man shakes his head. (CONTINUED) 
 My son. He writes his own material, he's proud of that. Some people are proud, they cured leukemia. Old guy stops beating off long enough to laugh, my son thinks he's Eddie Murphy. Jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast. 
 Alex the astronaut. Harp raises his own glass. 
 Alex the astronaut. It seems to be a common ritual between them. Jimmy drinks, thumps the bottle down. Says, resolutely: 
 I've had it, Harp. 
 Had what? 
 It, man. I've had it. (takes a swig) I don't remember what I did  last night. I'm an idiot, Harp,   I act like a complete dickhead.   I don't have friends. I drink too   much. I fuck anything that's warm  and breathing. 
 Stay on that side of the bar. 
 (sighs) I cheated on my girl friend again. 
 You cheated on her?   You must be crazy. 
 Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so. His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on -- 
 The police won't help you, huh? 
 Sure. After I'm dead they'll perform the autopsy. 
 Guess you don't want to wait that long. 
 Guess not. 
 (scowls) They only play this kind of music? 
 What did you expect? 
 Pat Boone?   The Four Freshmen? 
 What are you, my father? 
 Yes, I'm your father. Get your clothes on. (beat) I hate this funk shit. It's gonna be an extra hundred bucks. 
 You're hilarious.      Sit next to the speaker, you'll     get used to it. After a while      you'll be screaming play that     funky music white boy. 
 The screaming part I believe. (CONTINUED) 
 The lovely Cory approaches Jimmy at the bar.     Harp looks on. 
 (seductive) Hello, handsome. How'd you like to buy me a bottle of champagne? 
 How much for a bottle? 
 Forty dollars. 
 No thanks. Nothing personal, my seventh grade teacher was killed by a drunk driver. 
 Tall guy?   Sandy hair? 
 That's the one. 
 I had to swerve three times to get him. 
 Ha-ha. 
 So no bottle, then? 
 For forty bucks I'd rather drink my own piss. 
 That's extra. And with that, she leans over and moulds her lips to his. Time passes. These two know each other, it would seem. Cory pulls away. Jimmy smiles. 
 Hi, Cory.   Rough night? (CONTINUED) 
 Arrgh.   I've had it to here. 
 (grins) I'll bet you have. She slaps his face.   He feigns innocence.   Points to Hallenbeck. 
 Who's the stiff? 
 He's nobody. (beat) I have to get ready to dance. 
 Come back soon. I want to buy you a drink. She smiles and moves off, swishingly. Jimmy watches her go. His gaze wanders across the room to Hallenbeck. He frowns. 
 Near the stage, the would-be Eddie Murphy steps up to the mike and says: 
 You know, crowd, these ladies are fine, but let me tell you the three reasons men prefer sheep: they're always in the mood, they never bitch, and after you fuck 'em you can eat 'em. A few chuckles.   Some coughs.   More coughs than chuckles. 
 (plowing ahead) And now, here's a lady that's always in the mood, put your hands together for the lovely and talented Ms. Cory...! Applause. A syncopated DRUM BEAT kicks in.     AEROSMITH'S LATEST erupts from the SPEAKERS. And then she comes on. And even Joe Hallenbeck must draw in a sharp breath. (CONTINUED) 
 sits with his drink untouched before him. Pats his suit pockets, searching for a smoke. Removes a crumpled, empty pack, as: 
 saunters up, looking less than friendly. He looks at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck does not look at him. 
 Hi.   You're nobody. 
 Shhh.   Don't tell anyone. 
 That's what Cory said.    She said you were nobody. Only Hallenbeck's eyes move. He looks up, regards Jimmy coolly. They size each other up. Hallenbeck sighs. 
 Easy, Junior,   I'm not raining on your parade.    She's too young for me. I'm just    keeping an eye on her for a few   days. 
 I see. What are you, some kind of bodyguard? 
 Something like that. You got a cigarette? 
 No.   Is Cory in trouble? 
 I hope not.   You tell me. 
 She didn't mention anything to me. 
 Mmmm.   That bothers you, doesn't it? (CONTINUED) 
 Maybe. 
 Don't sweat it. Women have secrets. Water is wet, the sky is blue, and women have secrets. (beat) I'll buy you a beer. Sit down. Jimmy remains standing. 
 She hired you, huh?      What, you in the phonebook? 
 Yeah.    Actually, she hired my buddy Mike.    I'm filling in. 
 Where's Mike? 
 He died. 
 Sorry to hear it. 
 Don't be. He was a lousy surveillance man. Jimmy leans forward, palms flat on the table. 
 Look, friend, I don't know who you are or what's going on. But Cory is my girl friend and if she's in trouble, I want to hear about it. 
 That's client confidential. 
 Tell me anyway. 
 Nope. 
 I say two words to Cory and you don't get paid, asshole. (CONTINUED) 
 Do it. 
 You sure? I'm looking at your suit, you could use the dough. 
 You don't like my suit, guess what? I don't like your money. 
 Good, 'cause you're not getting any. 
 Story of my life. 
 What is? 
 Not getting any. They stare each other down.      Hallenbeck calmly sips his bourbon. 
 You couldn't protect a cup of warm piss. 
 (nods) Hit me. 
 Excuse me? 
 Hit me. Bust me in the chops, chickenshit. (beat) You're not afraid, are you, Jimmy...? 
 (freezes) You know who I am? 
 James Alexander Dix, L.A. Stallions, '86 and '87. Barred from the N.F.L. on gambling charges. Allegations of point shaving to support a cocaine habit, never proven. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 HALLENBECK (CONT'D) Busted once for possession. You had the makings of a first class dumbshit. 
 Mister... You are now pissing me off. 
 About fucking time. (extends his hand) Joe Hallenbeck. I'm a private detective. 
 (ignores the hand) I don't know, Joe... You look like a dumb wop to me. 
 At least I didn't shit my talent away on coke, motherfucker. 
 Can I hit you now? 
 Absolutely. Jimmy throws a short jab at Hallenbeck's chin. It never gets there. Joe moves, lightning quick, and suddenly Jimmy's fist is trapped. Dead stops. Fingers grinding into palm. Jimmy swears. Stumbles. Sits down hard. Hallenbeck releases him. 
 Please, have a seat. 
 (gasping) You think you're some kind of hot shit tough guy, huh? 
 (shrugs) It's not a question of tough. I'm bigger than you, and I was trained. So I can take you. That's just the way it is. You can throw a better pass. (beat) How about that beer? (CONTINUED) 
 Piss off. 
 (signals the waitress) You were a great quarterback, Jimmy. I watched you play at Washington State. Red shirt freshman in '82. Followed you with the Stallions. Good scrambling ability, seventy percent completions from the pocket... You had the best gun in the N.F.L. Jimmy looks at him, puzzled.    Didn't they just swap punches? 
 Yeah.   Thanks. I guess. 
 (big smile) Hell.   I'm a fan. 
 Alex the pediatrician. 
 (giggles) Alex the pediatrician. They drink.   And from this blissful affirmation of life we -- 
 I didn't vote for you, you bastard. He looks away, and suddenly notices something on the ground: A half-smoked cigarette butt. Just sitting there. Joe stares at it. Thinks it over. Starts to walk away. Stops. 
 You're a fuckin' lowlife, Joe. (CONTINUED) 
 HALLENBECK'S POV 
 #1 That's him.   He was with her. 
 #2 Shit, he's packing. What should we do? 
 #3 Get him away from here.   Then kill him. 
 #2 There's no contract for him. 
 #3 Then do it for free. Just do it elsewhere. 
 #2 Start walking. I'm right behind you. 
 The two other Hitmen return to their gray, late-model sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the nightclub. Waiting. (CONTINUED) 
 That's what you think. Last night I fucked your wife. The gunman cracks up.   Hallenbeck grins drunkenly. 
 CRAG-FACE Oh, you did, huh? How'd you know it was my wife? 
 She said her husband was a greaseball with bad breath. The guy cracks up again. 
 CRAG-FACE You're pretty cool for a guy gonna take a bullet. 
 After fucking your wife, I'll take two. The hitman wheezes laughter.   Joe just grins. 
 CRAG-FACE You're a funny guy. It's a shame to take you off. Here, kneel down. 
 Are you kidding? We barely know each other. The hitman is now giggling, shaking his head. 
 CRAG-FACE This is wild. I never shot no funny guy before. (CONTINUED) 
 You need a special funny bullet. 
 CRAG-FACE Come on, cut it out. Head or chest? 
 That's what your wife said. 
 CRAG-FACE Would you quit with the wife? Enough is enough. 
 Ask me how fat she is. 
 CRAG-FACE How fat is she? 
 She's so fat I had to roll her in flour and look for the wet spot. You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap her thigh and ride the wave in. (the hitman loses it) Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except when you poke her in the stomach, she farts. I got a buddy he's an archaeologist, organized an expedition to her chin. They got lost in her nasal hair. But seriously, her eyes are like the streets of Paris: crossed. They're so crossed when she cries the tears run down her back. She's got back-tearia. 
 CRAG-FACE (can't stop laughing) Oh, that's awful. Buddy, you're a fucking rio -- From a kneeling position, Hallenbeck flings a handful of gravel at the man's eyes. The man cries out. Stumbles backward. And Hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring. Not drunk at all. He takes  the broken bottle he's been clutching and cuts the guy's throat like a knife through butter. The hitman stands with a shocked look on his face. Blood bubbling. FIRES the GUN once, into the ground. Drops it from nerve- less fingers. Stares at Hallenbeck, aghast. (CONTINUED) 
 CRAG-FACE Bastard. Hallenbeck meets his gaze.    A savage, feral gleam in his eye. 
 And then some. The guy pitches over dead. Hallenbeck kneels beside him. Retrieves his .38, holsters it.       Slips the hitman's pistol into his waistband. 
 I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th. He takes off running. 
 I can't believe it. The bastard split on me. (sighs) I'm staying at a motel for a couple days. Will you follow me? 
 Sure. 
 The Hitmen wait in the darkened sedan. Watching Jimmy and Cory. The driver keys the ignition. Starts the car. In his lap is an automatic rifle. 
 Move!! (CONTINUED) 
 passes Jimmy. Accelerating. ENGINE REVVING. Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car. It's enough: Everyone inside is armed to the teeth. The SEDAN ROARS around the corner, cutting in front of Jimmy. 
 Oh God. This is a hit this is a fucking hit!! 
 comes up behind Cory. Comes up fast. Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile: 
 frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch -- And stalls out. He roars with anger. Flings open the door. Leaps out and runs forward, screaming: 
 Cory, get out of there!! Too late.    Cory is already out of her car, yelling: 
 Hey, can't you fucking drive?? (CONTINUED) 
 Oh Gooood!! And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn -- And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy. He takes a running start. Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap. BULLETS DICE the metal behind him. 
 move toward him, triggering THREE SHOT BURSTS. The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without warning -- 
 charges into the intersection.     Screaming bloody murder. He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING. One Hitman dies immediately: Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire. Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD. 
 is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window. 
 Hey. (as Jimmy looks up) Back up. 
 Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car backs up. Steam pouring from the crumpled hood. The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street. Like a sack of flour. 
 stands outside a door marked OFFICE. Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street. 
 It's all over, compadre. 
 Get off my property, mister. (CONTINUED) 
 (scowls) Sidewalk belongs to the government. He turns and looks at Jimmy. The kid is in pain. Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body. Eyes glazed. Hallenbeck says nothing. He crosses to the shattered Hitman. Kneels  down, fishes through the guy's coat pockets. Comes  up with a bloody pack of cigarettes. Extracts one.  Lights it. SIRENS fill the air. And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his coat -- Takes out the vial of coke. Ditches it. Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight. No one sees him do it. 
 come SQUEALING up, flashers turning. Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless -- And Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon. CUT TO: 
 Something stinks in here. (widens his eyes) My God, it's this statement! He flings the paper onto his desk. McCASKEY Sarge? 
 It's shit.    Hallenbeck is hiding something. (CONTINUED) 
 I know how the bastard's mind works. Every lie has eighty percent truth to it. Guy scares me. McCaskey is staring out the window at Hallenbeck. McCASKEY We lookin' at the same guy? 
 (smiles) Go ahead. Tell me what you see. McCASKEY I see a guy, looks like he just slept in his suit. 
 (nods) Yep.   That's what most people see. McCASKEY There's more? 
 Oh, yeah. There's more. (beat) A long time ago, that son of a bitch saved the President's life. 
 That stuff Cory fed you about a weirdo hassling her. That was all bullshit, wasn't it...? 
 Yeah. I don't know what she was into, but those were professional hitters tonight. Mob style. (beat) Tell me about Cory. What was she like? (CONTINUED) 
 None of your fucking business. 
 Listen up, friend. I'm trying to get a handle on this. How was she fixed for money? 
 (pause) I don't know. Pretty strapped, I guess. 
 Always kept an eye out for work? 
 No hooking, if that's what you mean. 
 It isn't. Tell me what she did at the club, besides dance. 
 The usual. Waitressing. Get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne. Sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill his troubles. Used to say she'd make a great psychiatrist. 
 She get many high rollers? 
 Sure.   Even rich guys get lonely. 
 Fine. (beat) So suppose one night, her 'guest' gets a little too drunk, and brags to her... reveals something about himself. Something that could hurt if it came out. What would she do? 
 I don't get it. 
 Would she blackmail him? 
 Jesus, I've had about enough of you -- (CONTINUED) 
 Would she consider the possibility of blackmail? 
 (sighs) She'd consider it. If she could get away with it. But she'd need hard evidence. Otherwise, it's 'I never said that,' his word against hers. 
 Right.   So what does she do? 
 I don't know.    Follow the guy?   Have him followed? 
 Bingo. Kid, this is making sense. She hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence. 
 Who does she hire? 
 Ah.  She hires my buddy Mike. (beat) Right? Right. It makes sense. Except -- 
 Except you told me that Mike was a shitty surveillance man. 
 Exactly. He got spotted. They made him, and they killed him. Then they took out Cory. 
 Christ, what did the two of them stumble onto? 
 Whatever it was, it was way over their heads. They knew they were in trouble. 
 How you figure? (CONTINUED) 
 Because Mike was scared. He bailed out and threw the case in my lap. 
 He handed it to you... without telling you how dangerous it was? Hallenbeck stares straight ahead.    Sighs and says: 
 He was fucking my wife, Jimmy. (beat) I die. He gets my wife. 
 Shit. This shirt cost me eighty bucks. 
 (holsters his gun) Glad to see, at a time like this, at least you got your priorities straight. 
 Do me a favor and shut up. You think I don't care that Cory's dead? (rubs tired eyes) Christ, I feel like I been rode hard and put away wet. (CONTINUED) 
 Get some sleep. 
 Wow. What stunning advice.      I was gonna go hiking. 
 Fuck you. They start down the hallway, side by side. 
 You know something, Joe, for a private eye, you sure don't go in for snappy comebacks. 
 How's this? Fuck you and the horse that looks like you. 
 Get some sleep. A passing PATROLMAN stops.   Eyes Jimmy thoughtfully. Frowns: 
 You look real familiar.     Do I know you? Jimmy grins, shrugs.   Obviously flattered. 
 You might.    Some people recognize me. 
 Got it. Peanuts Morton. Used to sell hash in Crenshaw District. 
 No, man. I played football. Jimmy Dix, L.A. Stallions. 
 What position? 
 Forget it. 
 Fuckin' football. Free agents ruined the damn game. (CONTINUED) 
 We gotta cross the parking lot. You wanna borrow my sunglasses? 
 Fuck you. 
 Hey, snappy comeback. You a detective? As the two cross the muster room toward the front doors, they pass the hooker we saw earlier. She is talking to her pimp. There is a heated exchange.     The pimp slaps her.   Hard. Suddenly, Jimmy lunges forward.     Balling his fists. 
 That son of a bitch! He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck grabs him, spins him bodily. Propels him out the front doors. Away from trouble. 
 What the fuck are you trying to do, Tarzan? 
 He hit the chick. 
 You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. Are you really this stupid or did you take lessons? 
 Guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all I'm saying. He just shouldn't, okay? 
 Why? Because they're weak and need protecting? (CONTINUED) 
 (pause, then) Yeah. He's serious. Hallenbeck starts to chuckle. Shakes his head, lights a cigarette. Laughs through the smoke. This may be the funniest thing he's ever heard. CUT TO: 
 Mind if I catch a ride with you? 
 Yes. 
 My car's fucked up, remember? 
 Take the bus. 
 Cut it out. Look, you sorta saved my life. Let me buy you a beer. 
 I'm not thirsty. Good night. He approaches his battered Plymouth.    Jimmy scowls. 
 That's it.     Good night? 
 Go home.     Get some sleep. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I'm gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend. 
 What's the message? (CONTINUED) 
 That we're out of it. That whatever they're doing, they don't have to worry about us. 
 You're kidding. Joe gets in the car.   Says nothing. 
 You're backing off, you're not gonna do anything? I watch T.V., what the fuck kind of private eye doesn't do anything? 
 The kind with a wife and kid. Look, it's over. My job is done. 
 Fuck you your job is done.    We witnessed a murder, Joe! 
 Yes, it was very exciting. Tomorow I'll take you to the zoo. (beat) You wanna play hero, go ahead. When you die, I'll take your closet full of eighty-dollar shirts. 
 Look, until this is over, I'm sticking with you. 
 The hell you are. 
 I'm part of this. We do something, we do it together. 
 Have a ncie night. He STARTS the CAR. 
 Don't drive away, Joe. Joe puts it in gear.   Pulls away. (CONTINUED) 
 Joe -- !     I'll tell the cops, Joe. Joe taps the brake.    Stops.   Leans out the window, says softly: 
 Tell them what, Jimmy? 
 That Mike Miller was fucking your wife. (beat) Only reason you're not in the cooler, tough guy, is the cops got no motive for Miller's death. When they find out Mikey was dickin' your old lady, seems to me you become suspect numero uno. I'm scared, and I'm coming with you, got it? Joe gets out of the car and advances on Jimmy. 
 You little creep, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you. 
 Go for it. Then the cops'll really love my story. (smiles) You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. 
 You and me is not a fight.     You and me is a massacre. 
 Gosh, you're tough. 
 Get in the fucking car. 
 You got any hobbies? (CONTINUED) 
 Mmmm. Used to be a pretty fair ventriloquist. 
 Ventriloquist, really? I hear Ps and Bs are the hardest. 
 Yeah, well, actually -- 
 (interrupts) Hey, you got any tapes in here? (leans forward) Man, what is this shit? Dick Haymes. Who the fuck is Dick Haymes? Jeez, you must be older than I thought. Hallenbeck grimaces and shifts in his seat. 
 What's the matter? Stomach problems? 
 Ear problems. 
 What kind of ear problems? 
 The kind that won't shut up. He stops at a traffic light. Sees a torn poster on a nearby telephone pole: CALIFORNIA HAS A VOICE - BAYNARD FOR SENATE. He grumbles. Gives it the finger. 
 Baynard, huh? What's the matter, you got some kind of beef with the guy? 
 You might say that. 
 You wanna share with the class? 
 (sighs) Bastard got me fired from my old job. (CONTINUED) 
 Yeah? What were you, cop or something? 
 Secret Service. 
 You're high. Get outta here. (grins) Really...? You protected the man? Holy shit, you musta got laid every night. 
 That's me. Every night. (beat) Where did Cory live? 
 She had an apartment on the West Side. Why? 
 I want to check it out. Jimmy stares at him, puzzled. 
 I thought you were off the case. 
 (scowls) Look, dipshit, I told you that to keep you out of my hair. (pause) My client's dead and I haven't earned my fee. 
 Whoa, back up. You mean, we're gonna nail these fuckers after all...? (grins) Damn. I knew there was a hero lurking beneath that gruff exterior. 
 Yeah, I'm a prince. Shut the fuck up. 
 Bet these places run a fortune. 
 Tell me about it. I'm paying the fucking rent. 
 How charming. Sounds like a great girl. What else did you spring for? Clothes? Car payments? 
 Wasn't like that. Cory could've had lots of rich guys. Me, she loved. 
 Oh. Love.   Well, forget about it, then. 
 Let me guess.    You don't believe in love. 
 (lights a cigarette) I believe in cancer. I believe in love. 
 What, they're both diseases? 
 Something like that. Jimmy shakes his head sadly. 
 Man, I don't want to meet the bitch that fucked you up. 
 I'm sure she'd love meeting you. Probably blow you on the front porch. 
 Little bitter, Joe? 
 Eat shit. 
 The cops are gonna want to check this place out, so don't disturb anything. 
 Yes, massah. 
 I think someone disturbed some stuff, Joe. 
 Well, shit. Looks like somebody beat us to it. 
 Beat us to what? 
 Whatever evidence Cory was holding. 
 Assuming there was any.     Stay here a minute. 
 Where you going? 
 Bathroom. You wanna come with me? Doctor said I shouldn't lift anything heavy. 
 I'll pass. Hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage. 
 Hallenbeck gazes around the devastated cottage. 
 Looks like you made it, baby. Jimmy emerges from the bathroom. 
 Find anything? 
 Yeah, there's some really nice rubble. (CONTINUED) 
 I may have something. 
 What? 
 Later.   Let's get out of here. 
 Where the hell are you going? 
 As long as we're here, I might as well take Cory's car. 
 You got the keys? 
 Yeah.    I'll follow you. Hallenbeck starts to turn away.      Jimmy gets in the car. Hallenbeck stops. Frowns. 
 Cory has two cars? 
 Yeah. This one's just sitting here until she can sell it. The color drains from Hallenbeck's features. 
 Jimmy, no!! He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the driver's seat before he can key the ignition. 
 Ouch -- !     What's your problem? 
 Hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car. (CONTINUED) 
 They used a car bomb on Mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too. (stands) Except they wired the wrong car. Jimmy pales noticeably. 
 Oh.   Shit.    Oh. Jeez. Hallenbeck claps him on the back. 
 Easy, kid. No harm, no foul.     We caught it in time. He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling. Cheerfully unaffected. Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard. Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other way. 
 What are you doing? Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters. 
 Gotta disconnect the fucker. 
 Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something? 
 (smiles) Relax, Junior, I used to do this for a living. He isolates one wire.    Turns and offers the cutters to Jimmy. 
 You wanna do it? 
 No, man, I -- (CONTINUED) 
 Come on, chickenshit. Just snip the wire. Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath the wheel well. Plucks at the wire tentatively. Cuts. 
 Oh, shit not that one! Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass. Hallenbeck is chuckling softly. Shakes his head as he walks around to release the hood. 
 You're a fucking asshole! 
 And then some, Junior. And then some. TIME CUT TO: 
 We'll hand this over to the cops. They can analyze it. 
 Great.   So what now? 
 (shrugs) You tell me, kid. 
 Give up?     Flee? Go really far away? 
 I got a better idea. Let's check in with my family. They start walking toward Hallenbeck's Plymouth. Hallenbeck tosses the car keys to Jimmy. 
 I'm tired.    You drive. (CONTINUED) 
 Sure.   Family, huh?   You got kids? 
 Yeah.   Little girl. 
 Does she like you? 
 Not much, no. And she likes Prince, so go figure. 
 I like Prince. 
 Great, you can marry my daughter. Or better yet, fuck my wife. I hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid I.D.'s. (beat) Open the trunk. 
 (indicating bomb) You're just gonna stick that in your trunk? 
 (nods) You're right. Let's leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with. Jimmy opens the trunk. As he does, however, a voice rings out suddenly from the darkness. 
 (O.S.) Hold it right there, gentlemen. They stop.   Slowly they turn. 
 are approaching from out of the trees. One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy. The other carries a silenced Beretta. 
 Is it the cops? 
 No, Jimmy.   It's not the cops. (CONTINUED) 
 Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late for a stroll, don't you think? 
 Yeah, you two better be getting home. 
 The streetlights are on. 
 That's amusing. How delightful to find such amusing men so late at night. (beat) I don't believe I've had the pleasure. 
 No, I don't believe you have. (to Jimmy) He'd like to have the pleasure. 
 Tell him it's not for sale. 
 He says it's -- 
 What's your name, fuckface? This from the Shorter Man, who is clearly not happy. 
 (shakes his head) I'm asshole. He's fuckface. 
 Jake, apprise Rodney Dangerfield here of his situation. (CONTINUED) 
 Perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now, yes? Jimmy rushes forward, snarling. The Beretta swivels. Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut. 
 (gasping) Easy... Jim... All they want is the evidence... 
 The evidence. Very smart. See, Jake, he knows when a situation is untenable. (smiles) You like that word? 
 Great word. 
 It occurs to me that you may have the evidence in question. 
 (spits out blood) Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing with geniuses. 
 Leave him alone, you fuck! 
 Back off, Jimmy. The Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy. 
 Leave him alone...? (shrugs) Whatever you say. Jake? The Short Man steps away from Hallenbeck. Turns and launches a kick at Jimmy's groin. Connects. The kid drops to the ground, retching. (CONTINUED) 
 (sighs) Ah, my young friend... I neglected to tell you that Jake attacks his job with a certain... exuberance. 
 Christ... I'm being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble. 
 He's still in a good mood, Jake. Kick him again. Jake steps forward. 
 Wait! Hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips: 
 You want the fucking evidence that the stripper had. I've got it. So we can play games, or I can hand it over. 
 And then you'll let us go, right? 
 Sure.  We'll let you go. (to Hallenbeck) Where is it? Hallenbeck meets the Tall Man's gaze.    Speaks softly. 
 Hand me the car keys, Jimmy. Jimmy stumbles to his feet.    Looks at the Tall Man. 
 Walk over and hand him the keys. Slow and easy. Jimmy takes out the car keys.    Crosses to Hallenbeck. Gives him the keys. 
 The evidence is in the trunk. 
 Open it.     Slow. (CONTINUED) 
 I don't think so. He turns and throws the keys as far as he can. They fall out of sight behind a cottage. 
 Oops.    I guess nobody gets it. 
 You dumb bastard, you're going to pay for that. Jake, open the trunk. 
 Jesus fucking Christ! 
 Joe rolls over.    Looks at Jimmy.    Jimmy looks at Joe. (CONTINUED) 
 You alive? 
 Don't know yet. They crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones. 
 The dynamite? 
 Either that, or we're looking at a major factory recall. 
 Dead guys... don't make bad jokes, right? 
 Right. 
 So we're alive. 
 Yeah.    Hooray. He spits blood as SIRENS once more fill the night air, APPROACHING. 
 Go.   Get out of here. 
 What? 
 Get the fuck out of here, I'll take the heat on this one. Rent a car. Then go home and wait for my call. Do it. Jimmy meets Joe's eyes.    Nods.   Dashes off into the night. CUT TO: 
 Goddammit, this is a police matter, you son of a bitch! I'm sick and fucking tired of sweeping up your dead bodies, Joe, and the next time I see your ugly mug I'm puttin' a bullet in it. You got that? You are off the case, buddy. Is that clear? Hallenbeck stares at him.   Blows smoke.    Says nothing. CUT TO: INT. RENTAL CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 
 If you thought there was dynamite in the trunk, wait'll you see this. Hallenbeck reaches into the envelope and extracts a photograph: Two men having lunch together on a secluded patio. Both are older, distinguished-looking. Joe suddenly looks very pale. 
 The guy on the left is Connie Marcon, the owner of the L.A. Stallions. 
 Forget about him. Look at the guy on the right. 
 Sort of familiar. Who is he? 
 Senator Calvin Baynard. Jimmy draws a sharp breath.   Pause, then: 
 Let's go back to the cops.   I'm scared. 
 Take it easy, kid. It's not so bad. (CONTINUED) 
 Not so bad. Excuse me, did you just say the words not so bad? You don't understand, Joe, see, if a guy vomits on the sidewalk, you don't say, 'Oh, hey, it's not so bad, there's some ham in there.' It's fucking vomit, okay? This is bad. Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette. Stares straight ahead through the windshield.   Begins to talk: 
 When I was thirty, I was on the President's personal security force. Once night I was on the way home from a late session. I'm on the highway just outside of Georgetown when I see something up ahead. 
 Another time. Another night. A younger-looking Hallenbeck. Rugged features. Clipped military haircut. He is driving. Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist. Up ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog: 
 is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass. He SCREECHES to a stop. 
 In a dream-like SLOW MOTION, he approaches the overturned car. There are two dead bodies inside. A woman. A little boy. In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with suction cups to the remaining glass. The furry cat is splattered with blood. (CONTINUED) 
 (V.O.) It was a high-speed collision. Both cars were totaled. The woman and the boy were dead. The driver of the other car wasn't. 
 is weaving toward Hallenbeck. Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes. He wears an $800 suit. Tan Cordovan loafers.   Silk tie. 
 Fuckin' bitch... She got in front of me, man. Shit. My fuckin' car. Stupid bitch wrecked my car... He stumbles toward Hallenbeck, eyes attempting to focus. 
 Do you know who I am...? I'm Louis Baynard, my father is Calvin D. Baynard, man. Call my father, he'll take care of it. The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck. Clutching at Joe's lapels. Wheezing liquor fumes. He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joe's hand. 
 You'll tell 'em what happened, right...? Bitch swerved in front of me, man. Wrecked my fuckin' Mercedes. Right...? 
 (V.O.) I could smell bourbon on him, big time. He was  standing there, not a scratch on him. I went a little nuts. I hit  him. In SLOW MOTION, Hallenbeck backhands the rich drunk, with a head-snapping impact that bursts lips. Breaks teeth. We see the Drunk's head slowly strike the asphalt. A sickening concussion. 
 The blow was non-lethal. But when he fell, his head hit the pavement funny. Put him in a coma. (CONTINUED) 
 Even when he came out of it, he was never right in the head. His dad fixed everything with the cops. The accident report disappeared. A week later the police found half a kilo of crack cocaine planted in my house. Acting on an anonymous tip. 
 The senator fucked your job. 
 And my pension. And my marriage. Only reason I'm still licensed to carry a gun, the man himself made a few calls. Since then I'm just playing it out. Day by day. Jimmy is silent for a moment.   Then: 
 Cory tumbled to some sort of deal between Marcon and the senator, and they had her killed. (beat) We gotta show this photo to the cops. 
 Not yet. I need more evidence. (beat) I want Baynard, Jimmy. I want to bring him down. I could use your help. 
 Why should I help you? 
 Because if Baynard takes a fall, so does Marcon. The man who kicked you out of professional football. 
 is bound hand and foot to the posts of a lavishly appointed bed. Around her, the room is filled with Kleig lights. Reflectors. Camera equipment. The girl is scowling furiously.    She speaks to the director: 
 I want the sheets changed, Milo. 
 MILO (MAN) Of course you do, but we're running behind, dearest. 
 I don't give a shit. I'm an actress, not a piece of meat, and I want clean sheets! 
 Fine. It's done. Right after this next shot. A strident BEEPER GOES OFF on Milo's belt. He turns to the two-man crew and claps his hands for attention. 
 Okay, let's do it. (beat) Roll camera. 
 Rolling. 
 And... action! The closet door opens. A hulking man emerges. He is carrying a chainsaw. The Girl on the bed stares, incredulous. 
 Milo... What the fuck is this, some kind of joke? (CONTINUED) 
 Not at all, dearest. It's what's known as a snuff film. The hulking man pulls the starter cord.        The SAW ROARS to life. 
 Oh God Milo please oh God oh no please Miloooo!! A smile twitches Milo's upper lip. 
 Easy, Pablo.   She's not a piece of meat. He exits.    Closes a sound-proofed door behind him. 
 Yes, Mr. Marcon? How can I help you? 
 (V.O.) Is this line secure? 
 One hundred percent, sir. I wouldn't have used your name otherwise. 
 (V.O.) Sid and Jake are dead, Milo. Killed in an explosion. Looks like we got a new player in the game. 
 Who is he working for? 
 (V.O.) From available information, he appears to be a free agent. Guy by the name of Joe Hallenbeck. Milo sits and begins punching keys on a computer. (CONTINUED) 
 (V.O.) Get me everything you can on this fucker, Milo. I want it on my computer screen in fifteen minutes. 
 Yes, sir.   And then? 
 (V.O.) And then you'll be handling it personally. 
 So I get to meet your family, huh? What's your daughter like? 
 She's like thirteen. And if you even look at her funny, I'll shove an umbrella up your ass and open it. 
 First things first. I'm starving. (notices Darian) Hey, kiddo. Why aren't you in bed? DARIAN I'm watching television. 
 I can see that. DARIAN I hate you.   Leave me alone. (CONTINUED) 
 She's pissed off because I wouldn't let her go out on a date with her friend Billy. DARIAN I missed the biggest party of the year. 
 Why couldn't she go? 
 (incredulous) Because she's thirteen, that's why. (to Darian) I bought you some ice cream. DARIAN I'm not talking to you. 
 Gee, that's a shame. You always have such pleasant things to say. 'I hate you, Dad.' I'm gonna miss that, darn it... (beat) It's chocolate chip, your favorite. DARIAN I don't care.    You're an asshole. 
 That's for saying asshole. God, I hate wasting food. Wanna abuse me some more? Go ahead, shock me. You know, I hardly ever hear the word asshole. DARIAN Bullshit, I bet you get it all the time. 
 All right, knock it off. (CONTINUED) 
 Hey, you want it, you got it, lady. DARIAN Thank you, asshole. 
 You're grounded for a week. DARIAN Yes, sir, asshole. 
 That's two. You wanna play this game? I love this game. DARIAN Just leave me alone. (to Jimmy) He thinks he's fuckin' Ward Cleaver. 
 All right, that's it. You wanna be a gutter mouth? You wanna sound like your mother, well that's terrific. Christ, all day long I don't take enough abuse, I gotta listen to shit from you! 
 Hey, Joe, take it easy... 
 Don't you tell me how to talk to my kid. DARIAN All I wanted was to go to a party, but Pop here thinks I'm out to get laid. 
 Go for it, kiddo. All the dirty words. Come on, shock me. Go ahead. DARIAN Sure thing, you dumb fuck-up. (CONTINUED) 
 All right, I've had it. Go to your room. Or I will whip your behind. DARIAN You'd probably like it. Hallenbeck takes her by the arm and drags her out of the chair. Toward her room. 
 Goddammit, you are my daughter and you will respect me, got that? You got it? You don't ever call me a fuck-up. DARIAN Why shouldn't I, Mom calls you that all the time. That stops him.   He looks at her, stricken. 
 Your mother called me a fuck-up...? When? DARIAN On the phone to Uncle Jay. 
 Uncle Jay? Ohh, Christ, I'm a fuck-up, but Uncle Jay, now there's a real stand-up guy. Shit, the bastard cheats on his tax form, I'm surprised he hasn't done time! Why don't you ask your mother why Mister Wonderful isn't in jail for tax evasion? DARIAN (smiles) Because he doesn't fuck up. She goes into her room and shuts the door. Hallenbeck rubs his eyes. Leans against the wall, exhausted. 
 You know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers. (CONTINUED) 
 No. Anything that much fun, I'd want to do myself. 
 I think we could both use a drink. Hallenbeck   crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of Seagrams.    Swigs.  Hands it to Jimmy. As Jimmy drinks, he notices   a photo on the wall: Hallenbeck shaking hands with   George Bush. 
 That's you? 
 Yeah.    That's me. 
 You look like the dad on 'The Brady Bunch.' 
 Yeah, I was a regular Boy Scout. Joe starts to fix a sandwich.      Jimmy takes nips from the bottle. 
 So.    You gonna get a divorce? 
 Don't know. He bites into the sandwich.      Not really tasting it. 
 You don't like women much, do you, Joe? 
 (mouth full) Mike Miller wasn't the first time. Sarah has cheated on me before. Twice. I never told her I knew. At first, my opinion of women took a real dip, yeah. 
 And now? 
 Now I'm content if I like the guy she's fucking. This last one was my best friend. (CONTINUED) 
 Horseshit, he was a scumbag private eye. 
 What am I, Jimmy? 
 He tried to get you killed. 
 Friends can't be perfect. (sighs) I wish the sky wasn't blue. I wish water wasn't wet. I wish I didn't still love my wife. He eats in silence.   Jimmy says: 
 You know what I did last night? 
 What? 
 I went to a party and shit on a car. 
 Damn.   You, too? 
 I'm a complete loser. Capital 'L.' All I ever wanted... was to be somebody's hero, you know it...? Now I mostly sit around. Watch T.V. Get laid. I'm a fucking slug, throw salt on me I'd curl up. Life sucks. 
 You're wrong. 
 Life doesn't suck? 
 No, life sucks. But you're not a loser. Cory loved you. 
 Yeah, and the last thing I did was cheat on her. (beat) Why do people cheat, Joe? (CONTINUED) 
 Because it's easier than paying the tax, Junior. 
 Ooooooh.     Very deep. 
 So deep I don't know what the fuck it means. 
 It means another drink is required. He raises the bottle. 
 Alex the accountant. He drinks.   Hallenbeck frowns, watching him. 
 Is Alex your accountant? 
 No.  But he could have been. (beat) Alex was my son. Hallenbeck stares at him. 
 I was married at 19. Sweet young thing, looking to get out from under daddy's thumb. I didn't know she was a junkie. All during her pregnancy. Shooting up. There were complications. She died. Alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator. Fell asleep. Died before he woke up. (takes a drink) He was born... He had time for one dream... and then he died. I wonder what his dream was about. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I think about him a lot.     I mean, who was this... guy? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
 JIMMY (CONT'D) This little guy who only got seventeen minutes, who was he, Joe...? What was he like? (beat) What would he have been? 
 He would have been a great ball player. Like his dad. 
 (shakes his head) No. He had to die, Joe.     Don't you see? 
 Why did he have to die? 
 (softly) Because he came out of me. He puts aside the bottle.    Scowls. 
 I'm gonna borrow your shower. He exits.    Hallenbeck watches him go.     Says nothing. 
 Not in my house, you dumb motherfucker. (CONTINUED) 
 Joe, man, you don't get it -- 
 Shut up. He picks up the vial of powder. 
 This is what you went looking for in Cory's apartment, isn't it? You found this when you found that envelope. He crosses to the toilet.    Jimmy cries out. 
 Joe, please! Joe drops the vial in the water. Flushes. Jimmy darts forward. Joe shoves him back. 
 You stupid bastard, do you know what you've done? That was a thousand bucks' worth of shit! 
 You got it, son. I'm just mixing it in with all the other shit. (beat) Get the fuck out of my house. Now. 
 You don't understand. 
 I said, get out. I'll break your fucking neck, kiddo. Jimmy glares at him.    Coldly defiant. 
 Go ahead, tough guy. Go ahead. (beat) I'm trying to survive, man. I use that stuff to get by, so fuck you. 
 I don't use it. I get by. (CONTINUED) 
 Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right, you stand there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on you, did you, pal?? And your fucking kid?? And I said to God, 'Hey, buddy, what gives? I go to church, I give to the United Way, what is this dead wife and kid shit...?' And he didn't say nothin', Joe. He grabs a towel.   Scrubs savagely at his wet torso. 
 And then I lose my job, my fucking life, okay, and why...? You know why? Because I gambled. Whoa, hold on, stop the presses, Jimmy gambled, well shit, of course I gambled, everybody does, and the fucking league knows it! He advances on Joe, trembling with anger. 
 Why, Joe? Why is there an injury report in pro football, huh...? Nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the N.F.L. does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread! Marcon... the commissioner ... those fucking hypocrites... killed the last thing I could do, Joe...! I can't do anything... anymore. 
 I couldn't save my wife... She died screaming and I couldn't do a Goddamn thing... And my baby came out... and he was so fuckin' small, Joe... He was too fuckin' small... He collapses against the wall. Slides down to a sitting position.   Huddled on the floor. Hallenbeck watches him. Says nothing. For a moment, he seems moved to compassion... Then his gaze hardens. He kneels next to Jimmy. (CONTINUED) 
 When you're through feeling sorry for yourself, the front door's that way. 
 (wipes his eyes) You're a total bastard. 
 You brought cocaine in my house. End of story. Jimmy is silent.   He stands.     Exits into the hall. 
 Huh? There is an awkward pause. Darian holds out a football card. Young, smiling Jimmy. The card is old. Tattered. DARIAN I'm sorry I acted like a bitch. Would you sign my card? Hallenbeck steps forward. 
 I told you to go to your room. 
 Go to bed.   This guy's not signing anything. DARIAN Aw, come off it. 
 Forget it, Darian. (beat) The guy's a loser. Big time. Darian's face is a mask of confusion. (CONTINUED) 
 I never shaved points, Joe.     I never did. Joe is silent.   Stone-faced. 
 If you want my help, I'm at the Casa Loma Apartments on Ventura. He exits. Shuts the door behind him. Darian goes into her room, fuming. Shuts the door. 
 Smile, you fuck. 
 Goddammit, Jimmy, I told you -- ! It isn't Jimmy. Standing on the porch is a tall, thin man with blond hair. The man removes a TASER GUN from his overcoat. 
 Good morning, Joseph. He FIRES point-blank. The electrode hits Hallenbeck in the chest. A CRACKLE of electric current. Hallenbeck jerks spastically. The world spirals away. He plunges down into darkness. CUT TO: 
 Good morning, Jimmy. 
 Who are you, and how the fuck do you know my name? 
 (frowns) This is the guy? You sure it's the guy? 
 This is him. 
 The kid with the million-dollar arm? 
 Yeah. 
 Shit. He don't look like much.     I wouldn't pay no million dollars for this bozo. 
 Neither will anyone else, anymore. 
 I'm growing whiskers here, guys. You got something to say, fucking say it. 
 Wow. Tough guy stuff. Must have caught it from his buddy Hallenbeck. (CONTINUED) 
 Who? 
 Don't play dumb, shithead. You were with him last night at the club. 
 Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business. 
 Get ready, kid. This one's an E ticket. And, with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms. Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence. 
 Please, guys, don't do this... Jesus Christ, I was just her boyfriend, I swear to God, please! They toss Jimmy over the fence. 
 Not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances. In this case, however -- A fifty-foot drop... 
 Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm, oh Jesus Christ!!! He kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth. 
 Gimmee the bad news first. McCASKEY Bad news is, they just pulled Jimmy Dix out of a construction site on Ventura. He's busted up. 
 Okay, now gimme the bad news. McCASKEY I just got a call from Hallenbeck's neighbor. Bessalo looks up, intrigued.    McCaskey continues: McCASKEY Now, according to Hallenbeck, Mike Miller came to the house early that morning to talk about a case, right? 
 Right. (CONTINUED) 
 He lied.   Why did he lie...? Realization hits him like a thunderbolt. 
 Shit.   Miller was fucking his wife. McCASKEY What? 
 That's why the car was there, Miller was fucking Hallenbeck's wife, Hallenbeck just got back from out of town, remember? (beat) Christ, Joe wasted the bastard himself! He stabs a button on the phone.   Barks into the receiver: 
 I want an A.P.B. out on Joe Hallenbeck. Now. Find him and if he resists arrest, shoot the bastard. 
 I let him go, Mick. He wasted Mike Miller and waltzed right out of my office, I let him go, Goddammit! McCASKEY Relax, Ben. We'll bring him in. He's not that good. 
 You wanna bet? And, with that, we promptly -- CUT TO: 
 comes INTO FRAME and slaps him.    Hard. Rocks his head to one side. 
 I think he's awake. 
 Make sure. Chet's hand flashes out for a third slap -- And from nowhere, Joe Hallenbeck's hand magically appears. Intercepts the blow. Clamps onto Chet's hand and wrenches it. A cry of pain. Chet stumbles backward, cradling the wrist. 
 I'm awake. His eyelids creak open. He squints, adjusting to the light. Studies his captors. 
 You nearly broke my wrist, man. 
 Life's a bitch. (CONTINUED) 
 Milo warned us to watch out for this guy. Chet is seething.     He glares at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck yawns. 
 Fuck that. Look at him. He's nothin'. Guy's a piece of shit. 
 Anybody got a cigarette...? Chet steps forward.     Grins wickedly. 
 Sure, buddy.     I got a cigarette. He reaches into his shirt pocket. Extracts a Marlboro. Hands it to Hallenbeck. Takes out a lighter. Hallenbeck places the cigarette between his lips. Leans forward for a light -- And Chet slugs him in the face. The cigarette goes flying. Hallenbeck's head snaps back. Blood creeps from his lower lip. 
 (guffaws) Hey, baby, I thought you were tough. See, Pablo, he ain't so bad. Hallenbeck's eyes glint fiercely.      He takes a breath. Leans forward and says: 
 I seem to have dropped my cigarette. May I have another? Chet turns, meets his gaze.     The grin falters a bit. 
 (unnerved) Sure.   Sure thing, buddy. (CONTINUED) 
 I need a light. (beat) And if you touch me again... I'll kill you. A pregnant pause. The challenge hangs in the air. Slowly, Chet takes the lighter from his pocket. Pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features. Hallenbeck leans forward for a light. Chet extends his arm -- And slugs Hallenbeck in the face again. Rocks him. Chet howls with laughter. Pablo grins. 
 Baby!   Two for two! The laughter continues. Hallenbeck takes a deep breath. Stands up. Strikes with a flattened palm. Breaks Chet's nose. Drives it up into the brain. Chet stands, pole-axed. Blinks once. Pitches over dead. 
 Jesus Christ. (draws his gun) You son-of-a-bitch. Jesus Christ!! He rushes to Chet. Kneels beside him. Hallenbeck calmly returns to his seat. 
 You killed him! 'Fuckin' A, you killed him, he's fuckin' dead!!! Hallenbeck says nothing. (CONTINUED) 
 Is there a problem? 
 (still dazed) He killed Chet, Milo. The mother- fucker just killed him! Milo looks toward Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck says nothing. Instead, he calmly leans forward and picks up Chet's lighter from the carpet. Lights his cigarette. Blows smoke. 
 Oh, my. Oh, Goddamn. Joseph, Joseph, you don't disappoint me. He draws a Walther PPK and approaches Hallenbeck. Smiling and cheerful. 
 You seem to have killed one of my men. 
 (shrugs) I needed a light. Milo nods as if this makes perfect sense. 
 You took an awful risk. Pablo here could have shot you dead. 
 If you wanted me dead, you'd have already killed me. 
 Yes, that's true. (sits down) I suppose introductions are in order. 
 (waves his hand) Fuck it. You're the bad guy, right? (CONTINUED) 
 Yes.   I'm the bad guy. 
 And you've got the gun, and I'm supposed to tremble in fear, something like that? 
 Something like that. 
 Fine. I'll start trembling in a minute. Mind if I have a drink first? 
 (smiles) I don't see why not. Pablo, please take Chet's corpse into the other room, and then fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink. Suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway: 
 (O.S.) Make that two. Hallenbeck turns toward the new arrival. 
 Hey, look who's here. Connie Marcon himself. Sure enough, CONRAD MARCON saunters in, just like he owns the place. Which, by the way, he does. Tall, strong, Texas-tough. Dressed in a Saville Row suit. He frowns at Hallenbeck: 
 Careful, son. Only my friends call me Connie. 
 You got friends? When did this happen? 
 (chuckles) I'll give you one thing. You're pretty calm for a man in your position. (CONTINUED) 
 You're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year. 
 They're having some problems. 
 They stink. Marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment. 
 I'm glad you're here, Joe. We got a few things to discuss. 
 For starters, I'm sure you're aware that professional football is changing, and not for better. (lights a cigar) Used to be, you went to the local stadium come Sunday, you saw heroes. Guys who fought for their hometown. Anymore, no one gives a shit. Ever since Sonny Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe Namath back in '66, the sons of bitches just got greedier. Playing only for themselves. Giving nothing back to the game. Pablo hands him a double bourbon. 
 This year, the final blow: the N.F.L. votes to decertify the Players Organization. Eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents. Reduces football, once and for all, to commerce. To greed, you follow? 
 When do I say the Pledge of Allegiance? Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck. (CONTINUED) 
 Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year? Per week? An average of two point eight. 
 Oh, for Chrissake. You're telling me this whole thing is about TV ratings? 
 People have stopped watching, Joe! Everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? Guys like you. Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle. Hallenbeck reacts, startled.   Looks at Milo. 
 We took the liberty of researching your background. 
 How about it, Joe? Is it truth or hype? 
 (shrugs) I got the rifle in my closet as a souvenir. 
 There you go, that's what I'm saying. The public wants real heroes. Not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers. (beat) In fact, Joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football. Can you guess? It begins to dawn on Hallenbeck. 
 Gambling. (CONTINUED) 
 Exactly. Gambling. (puffs his cigar) Just one problem: football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states. And that, Joe boy, is where I come in. 
 (sudden realization) Shit, that's what this is about! You're bribing United States senators. Paying them to pass legislation -- 
 -- Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. Exactly. 
 Attendance goes up again.   TV ratings go up again. 
 You got it, son. The networks are happy. I'm happy. Everybody's happy. 
 Before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, I'm not your fucking son, and second... why am I still alive? Marcon stops pacing.   Sighs and sits down facing Hallenbeck. 
 It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard. 
 (takes a sip of bourbon) I don't get it. What's the snag? 
 I offered him the bribe and he wouldn't take it. Hallenbeck actually does a spit-take.     Sprays bourbon. (CONTINUED) 
 Baynard? Are you nuts? The guy's so crooked he shits slinkies. 
 Allow me to clarify: I offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money. 
 (sighs with relief) Thank God. For a minute there I felt hell freezing over. Did he ask for more than a million? 
 Does the Pope shit in the woods? He wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan. I don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die. 
 Taking off a U.S. senator, that's pretty ballsy. Even for an asshole like you. 
 Oh, I'm not going to kill Baynard, Joe. 
 Who is? Marcon says nothing.   Just looks at Hallenbeck and smiles. 
 Oh, shit. He rubs tired eyes. 
 I'm the perfect fall guy. Everyone and his uncle Max knows I hate Baynard. 
 (nods) Anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on you, Joe boy. My hands are clean. Hallenbeck scowls. (CONTINUED) 
 Any particular reason I should go along with this prize-winning scheme? 
 (smiles) Just one. He motions to Milo, who disappears through a doorway. Reappears a moment later. He's got Joe's wife. 
 Sit down, Joe. A moment.    Joe stands, smouldering.   On fire.   Sarah speaks: 
 Do what he says, Joe. Joe sits. Breathing shallowly. Eyes locked on Milo. 
 Are you alright, Sarah? 
 Yes. 
 That's a temporary condition, Joseph. As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your wife will make her motion picture debut. He meets Joe's murderous gaze... and smiles. 
 Look, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: I don't know anything and I can't help you. Okay? Can I go now? 
 Let me get this straight: you're walking along, minding your own business, when two guys you never met jump you and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason. Is that it? 
 That's it. 
 You're full of shit, kid. (beat) Tell me where Hallenbeck is. 
 How the fuck should I know?    Try his house. 
 We did.   Where is he? 
 For Chrissake, I just met the guy. (beat) Look, Sergeant. I don't give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just busted my throwing arm and I'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here. He glares defiantly at Bessalo. CUT TO: 
 Slumped outside the door to his apartment. Asleep.      A crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand. He kneels beside her.    Touches her shoulder. 
 Hey.    Wake up. 
 approaches along the dock, looking lean and mean in an Izod shirt. He stops in front of Sarah and Joe Hallenbeck. (CONTINUED) 
 Get up. 
 Go fuck yourself. Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbeck's ribs. Hallenbeck gasps in pain. 
 I meant that... in a good way... Pablo hauls him to his feet.    Props him against the railing. 
 Time for a little payback, Joe. Call it a service to dear departed Chet. He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle. Sarah cries out in alarm. 
 How's that feel, fuckhead? 
 (weakly) I'm asshole... she's fuckhead. And with that, Pablo lets him have it. 
 Easy, Pablo.   I want him conscious. Pablo is kicking Joe's prone form. 
 Goddamn you, stop it!!     Oh, Jesus, leave him alone! (CONTINUED) 
 Don't... look at me... 
 Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here, it's okay. (strokes his hair) I love you, Joe. 
 I get the shit beat out of me... puke all over myself... and now you love me? 
 I never stopped loving you, Joe. 
 Christ, you slept with three guys. 
 You knew about the others? 
 I knew. 
 You never said anything. 
 Figured... you needed them. 
 Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you say something? 
 Like what?   'Fuck you, Sarah'? 
 Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything to show that you... that you had some pride left. A pause.   Then Hallenbeck heaves a sigh. (CONTINUED) 
 Sorry... I'm fresh out. 
 I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of this. 
 Must be my trick ear. Sounded like you said, 'Get me out of this.' 
 You can take these guys, Joe. 
 I've got cracked ribs and a concussion. 
 Save me, Joe.    Be a hero. 
 I don't believe in heroes. 
 That's no excuse. He stares up at her for a moment.      Then, through bloody lips: 
 Fuck you, Sarah... And he smiles. 
 All right, lovebirds, break it up. He yanks Sarah to her feet. Lets his gaze roam up and down her body. 
 Nice tits. He rips open her blouse.   Roughly fondles her breasts. Hallenbeck. On the ground. He growls with fury. Starts to push himself up. (CONTINUED) 
 Stay down, fucker. Don't you move. At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock. Whistling cheerfully. 
 Careful, Pablo. We don't want to get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby. He squats next to Joe. 
 Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price. 
 You're gonna kill us both anyway. 
 Perhaps. But there are ways to die, and then there are... ways to die. Capisce? You determine your wife's fate. He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet. Propels him toward the boat. As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out: 
 Joe...! 
 I'll be back. (beat) That's a promise. Milo clubs Joe in the head with his pistol. 
 You're wasting my time, Joseph. Let's go. Hallenbeck turns. Dirty. Tired.        Unshaven.   Bloody. He looks at Milo... and grins: 
 If you touch me again... I'll kill you. They stare into each other's eyes. Hallenbeck does not give an inch. Milo hits him again. 
 I need to borrow a gun, Henry. 
 Marcon. INTERCUT: 
 It's Milo, sir. We're now underway and should be lying off Catalina within two hours. 
 Good boy, Milo. The commissioner's party starts at six. I'll put in a token appearance around six-thirty. 
 Very good, sir. 
 Any problems with Hallenbeck? 
 No, we're getting along famously. 
 Glad to hear it. No fuckups, Milo. I want him deep-sixed. 
 I assure you, neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise. 
 Christ, Milo, how come you always have to talk like a fruit? 
 If it annoys you, I    could always adopt a Texas drawl,    though I'm afraid I don't know    any stories about fucking pigs.     Sir. 
 Cows, Milo.   Never pigs. 
 I'll remember that, sir. He hangs up. Marcon replaces the receiver and chuckles. 
 Goddamn fruitcake. He turns, and suddenly we realize he's not alone in the room: a STRANGE MAN is seated in the shadows off to one side. His face is obscured... Marcon addresses him: (CONTINUED) 
 So far, so good. The Man in the corner nods, then speaks. As he does, we notice he has a speech impediment; it sounds like he's talking with his mouth full. 
 We've worked too hard, Con. There's no margin for error. 
 Take it easy, buddy.   We're covered. 
 You're using the first team, yes? 
 Absolutely. (sighs) Actually, I have no choice. 
 How's that? 
 Fuckin' Hallenbeck killed the second and third teams. 
 I'm gonna crash a party out on Catalina. Marcon will be there. He swings a bag of gear onto the boat.   Starts to store it. DARIAN Maybe... we should call the police. (CONTINUED) 
 No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. (beat) I'm sorry, Darian. DARIAN (about to cry) So... what do we do...? 
 What I do... is confront Conrad Marcon and threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back. DARIAN Is that gonna work? 
 Beats me, but I think it's what your dad would do. DARIAN I'm scared. 
 Me, too, honey. His gear stashed, he turns to Darian.   Tries a smile. 
 So... why'd you come to me, anyhow? DARIAN I don't know. I thought you'd... know what happened, know what to do... (beat) I mean, you were one of my dad's big heroes. Jimmy almost chokes... 
 What? (CONTINUED) 
 I'll get them back, kiddo.   I'll get them back. CUT TO: 
 slices through the murk, filled with light, laughter, 
. 
 Boats are arriving at a private dock. A steady stream of guests. Tuxedoes and evening gowns. A parade of phony hair and phony boobs. 
 as a thirty-shot clip is snapped into place. 
 Your wife's very pretty. 
 Fuck you, cocksucker. 
 My, my.   Little testy this evening. He pulls a switchblade out of his Windbreaker. 
 That's not very polite, you know, calling someone a cocksucker. A lot of hard Ks. Very abusive sounding. Hallenbeck says nothing. 
 What would you do, Joseph, if someone called you that? Would you cut out one of his eyes...? 
 Nope. 
 What would you do? (CONTINUED) 
 I'd go off and suck some cock and leave him the fuck alone. Milo studies Hallenbeck the way a museum curator might study a new species of fish. 
 It occurs to me, Joseph, that I would very much like to hear you scream. 
 Come again? 
 You're so cool, aren't you? So... if you'll pardon the expression... hard-boiled. I'd like, just once, to hear you scream in pain. 
 Play some rap music. Milo chuckles, shakes his head. 
 Fascinating. 
 When do I kill Baynard? 
 (laughs) Come now, Joseph, did you really think that I'd hand you a loaded gun? (beat) You're not really going to kill anyone. 
 I'm not? 
 No. He leans forward. 
 You're going to be framed for the senator's murder... when they find your corpse at the scene of the crime. 
 Okay, hot shit, let's do it. 
 Goddammit, I told you to go home! DARIAN Fuck you, I stowed away.    They're my parents, okay? Jimmy shakes his head.   Exasperated. 
 Fine, whatever. Just stay here. With the boat. (CONTINUED) 
 Anything funny happens, get the fuck out of here. Darian takes the keys.   Frowns, says: DARIAN You look terrible. 
 I feel terrible. 
 I was.   I kicked the habit. DARIAN When? 
 This morning.    Stay here. He swings over the side, onto the dock. DARIAN Don't let them break your other arm. 
 Thanks, kid.    You're a fuckin' inspiration. 
 At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard will leave the party, hopefully unobserved. He and his entourage will board a fast boat, and rendezvous with us at sea. 
 Jesus. He thinks he's geting his two-million-dollar payoff. Milo nods.   Points to two identical suitcases in the corner. (CONTINUED) 
 Baynard will not leave his boat. One of his men will board us, and inspect the contents of the suitcase. This suitcast. He opens one of the cases.   Hallenbeck stares. 
 Then we pull a simple switch. When the man returns to his boat, he's carrying this suitcase. He points to the identical twin. 
 Plastics? 
 (nods) Detonation upon opening. Enough to kill the passengers, not enough to sink the craft. (smiles) And when we place your charred corpse amidst the wreckage, the police will draw the inevitable conclusion: a down-on-his-luck P.I. makes a suicide strike against the man who cost a career. 
 That sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred? With a flourish, Milo pulls aside a tablecloth. Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline. 
 Maybe I'll get to hear you scream, after all... Just then, one of Milo's crew sticks his head in the door. 
 You better get up here, we got a problem. 
 bobbing in the water about thirty yards away. A FISHERMAN is waving his arms. Hailing them. Beside him, his wife and seventeen-year-old son. 
 Hey! Buddy, I got a cracked engine casing, I'm dead in the water! Can I get a tow? Milo swears under his breath.    Calls out: 
 I'm sorry, sir. This boat is Island Security, we're under strict orders to stay within this sector. 
 Aw, shit!     Look, it'll take ten minutes! 
 I'm sorry, we can't help you. 
 Goddammit, now I gotta call the Coast Guard! Milo's crewman steps up to the rail.    Speaks urgently: 
 Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast Guard down on top of us. Milo ponders for maybe three seconds.    Then he calls out: 
 Excuse me.     Sir? The Fisherman turns.    His family beside him. 
 Fuck you, sir. (CONTINUED) 
. The entire family is blown away. WOOD SPLINGERS POP and fly. 
. The bodies topple like broken toys. Milo ceases fire.   Turns to his crewman. 
 Problem solved. Get over there and put the bodies below where they can't be seen. He saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred. 
 Christ, I can't believe I agreed to this dog and pony show. Let's get it over with. 
 Gimmee the keys, kiddo. DARIAN Where are you going? (CONTINUED) 
 The Senator's here, and he's leaving by the back door. I'm gonna follow him. He keys the ignition. 
 Get off the boat. DARIAN Fuck you, man. No way. 
 Darian, Goddammit -- 
 Okay.     Shit.   Okay.   Easy.   Shit. He throttles forward. The Hatteras pulls away from the dock. CUT TO: 
 CO-PILOT This is Air One, over. 
 (V.O.) Roger, Air One, over. (CONTINUED) 
 CO-PILOT The drop zone is clear, repeat, the drop zone is clear, over. INTERCUT WITH: 
 Roger, Air One, over and out. (replaces the mike) Up anchor, gentlemen, we have a go. (points to Hallenbeck) Gag him and stash him. As Milo goes topside, one of the men tapes Joe's mouth. The other opens a cramped storage compartment. They stuff him inside.   Shut and lock the door. 
 Goddammit, I lost him.     I can't see a fucking thing. DARIAN See if this boat has sonar. 
 Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All. (CONTINUED) 
 Watch your mouth. DARIAN Take a bath in my ass. They're clearly having no fun. CUT TO: 
 Okay.   We're cool. Just then Milo enters the cabin.   Adopts a harsh New York accent as he angrily barks: 
 Hey! Any of you stupid fucks bother to frisk this goombah? 
 No, sir, we didn't think -- 
 Exactly, you didn't think! Goddammit, that's two million bucks there, now frisk the fuckin' guy! 
 Hey, baby, I'm clean, take it easy -- 
 Fuck easy. Against the wall, spread 'em! (CONTINUED) 
 Okay?   Satisfied? 
 We're cool, baby. He hands over the suitcase. 
 Baynard's man emerges onto the deck, carrying the suitcase. Steps over the rail, crossing to the Senator's boat. Gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there. They cast off the lines.   Freeing the two boats. INT. MILO'S YACHT - BRIDGE Milo watches, tense. As the lines are freed, he says: 
 Hard to starboard, get us out of here. Back off a hundred yards and wait for the blast. 
 All we're doing is burning gas. Sorry, kid, I'm turning back. The words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a throbbing NOISE, growing louder... Darian looks up puzzled. DARIAN Do you hear that -- ? And with that -- 
 
 Holy fucking shit! Rotor wash sprays in every direction. The noise is deafening. 
 Code yellow, code yellow, we got a bogie, repeat, we got a bogie, over. 
 Air One, Air One, where the fuck is he? 
 (V.O.) Nine o'clock, repeat, on your nine, and closing fast! 
 Jimmy's BOAT ROARS out of the fog... And suddenly he's in a world of shit. Less than fifty yards to port is Milo's yacht. Fifty years to starboard is the Senator's Marlineer. 
 Oh, wow.    We're fucked. He GUNS the ENGINE.     Spins the wheel, banks to port. 
 screams past, cutting across the bow, nearly taking off the roof -- Jimmy, wrestling the wheel, and meanwhile -- 
 Shit!   Something's going on. 
 What is it? 
 Another boat.    It's a fucking setup! 
 Get us out of here, now! 
 Who the fuck is he? A crewman grabs a pair of binoculars.       Meanwhile -- 
 Son of a bitch! It's Dix, the Goddamn quarterback! 
 (O.S.) There's a little girl with him! With that, he goes berserk. Draws his legs back, thunders them against the compart- ment doors. Kicks with all his might. Over and over like a crazed horse, as: 
 Air One does a flyby, circling, awaiting instructions. 
 Milo grabs the hand mike and says: 
 Air One, Air One, follow the Senator, roger? I'll take the sport boat, you take Baynard, over. 
 (V.O.) That's a roger. Over and out. 
 (turns to his men) Okay, let's go. Full throttle. 
 Milo's yacht is plowing ahead, gaining on Jimmy's Hatteras. The crew members take up positions on the prow. OPEN FIRE. 
 As he throws Darian to the deck, shields her with his body. The wheelhouse is RAKED by GUNFIRE. He grits his teeth. Reaches beneath his tux. Yanks out the BERETTA and returns FIRE, BAM -- BAM -- ! and meanwhile: 
 Fire in the hole! Fire, indeed.    It's a rapidly-spreading blaze. The pursuit is momentarily forgotten as the crew races to put out the fire, and meanwhile: 
 surfaces, gasping for air.    Trying to swim with his hands tied. 
 Shit.    I don't believe it. DARIAN Do something!     Hurry! (CONTINUED) 
 Keep the wheel like this!   Don't let it move! She grabs the wheel. Jimmy bends down. Opens a compart- ment. Takes out the boat's anchor. Metal hook, attached to seventy yards of chain. He hefts it like a grappling hook. 
 Third and long, baby, lets' go... 
 Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around the passing anchor and whoosh -- ! 
 What the hell's she doing here?? DARIAN I stowed away... GUNFIRE splits the air. Reminds them they're not out of the woods. 
 MILO'S YACHT 
 JIMMY'S BOAT Hallenbeck staggers to his feet. 
 Get below, Darian. And stay there. He stumbles into the wheelhouse.   Dazed.   Barely conscious. 
 Got any ideas? 
 Yeah. Go really fast and hope they don't catch us. (beat) Oh, shit. 
 What? 
 Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on. Into the fog they go, and, folks -- This is really scary. Because you can't see a foot in front of your face. They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour. Hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield. (CONTINUED) 
 We're dead. Except, just then, a strange thing happens: Milo's yacht veers off to the left. Away from Hallenbeck. Jimmy stares, dumbfounded. 
 What the fuck? They're peeling off. Why? A pause... then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt: 
 'Cause they got sonar, that's why! Hard to port! 
 Port? 
 Left, Goddammit. The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog -- 
 Shit fuck piss! They almost make it. As it is, they avoid a head-on.   Instead, they hit broadside. A sickening CRUNCH -- ! Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet. A momentary glimpse of faces rushing past -- Horrified tourists -- And then the ferry is behind them. Jimmy gets up. Staggers to the controls. Pushes the throttle. The boat lurches forward -- Then SPUTTERS. Fizzles. He swears violently. (CONTINUED) 
 We're on half power, we lost an engine! 
 swears again.   Bangs his fist. 
 We're sitting ducks. They got sonar. They can find us. 
 Kill the running lights and radio the Coast Guard. Jimmy flicks off the lights. Grabs the mike. As he does, a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit, causing him to pause... and then stare in shock as their boat emerges from the fog -- And Air One hovers directly overhead. 
 Fuck me. The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends, the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket. 
 Get down! They both hit the floor.    Hands over their heads -- And then the pilot makes a costly error: He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht. With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out of the fog -- PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER. Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it to shreds. Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. Turns night into day. 
 They move like sleepwalkers to the cockpit window. Stare in disbelief. Joe looks at Jimmy. Jimmy at Joe. Debris rains down. CUT TO: 
 What's that? Jimmy looks:    A bright object... going in circles... 
 That's Baynard's boat! 
 (nods) It can get us to shore faster than this one, don't you think? 
 Hand me the pole. Jimmy hands him a long, wooden pole with a hooked end. He fishes in the water. Snares a large, floating object. Swings it aboard. Drops it at Jimmy's feet. The suitcase. 
 What is it? 
 Birthday present. (CONTINUED) 
 Holy fucking shit!! 
 Wait here. He swings aboard the senator's boat. Gun cocked. Ready. 
 Sorry, Cal.    Life in the big city. CUT TO: EXT. LONG BEACH BOAT RENTALS - NIGHT The senator's boat pulls up to the dock.     No one is around. 
 Listen carefully. I'm gonna go get your mom back, okay? You're gonna go in the Denny's restaurant and stay there. Talk to the waitress but don't mention me. Mom and I will come pick you up later, got it? DARIAN (crying) They're gonna kill you...! 
 Are you kidding? I do this for a living. (hands her a twenty) Buy me an ice cream. I'll be back. (beat) I love you. She throws her arms around him. CUT TO: 
 Your prints are all over that boat. What happens when they find the bodies inside? 
 Quit being a fuckin' killjoy. He cuts the headlights.   Cruises to a stop behind a road- side dumpster. 
 Come on.   We've got some things to pick up. 
 A late-model Buick is parked just up the street from his house... There is a man slouched inside. Smoking. 
 Shit.   Someone's staking me out. 
 (clears his throat) Oh, I forgot to tell you. The police want you for killing Mike Miller. Hallenbeck shoots him a withering look. CUT TO: 
 I think I got someone!   Four o'clock! 
 is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage. Half his hair is burned away. His face is blistered. He looks up, pleading, at the Ensign, as: 
 He hides the Ingram beneath his body, cocked and ready. CUT TO: 
 Let's get him inside and tie him up. 
 Are you crazy? That's a cop!     You don't punch cops! 
 I forgot.    Hurry up. 
 Wear that. He strips off his own shirt.   Crosses to the closet. 
 You know how to use a gun? 
 The trigger's the little black thing. 
 Here. He hands Jimmy a shotgun and a box of odd, black cylinders. (CONTINUED) 
 Use these. They're shredders. Equipped with an explosive charge. When you fire the gun, they spray on impact. Take out anything within ten yards. 
 What are you gonna use? 
 A little souvenir... He reaches into the closet. Pulls out a sniper rifle. The rifle. The one responsible for the puckered scar on his chest. 
 Go bring the car around. 
 Face it, pal.    You're fucked by God. CUT TO: 
 Are you a literate man, Joe? 
 I got a subscription to Jugs magazine. 
 That's good. See, Joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story. 
 We've got Jimmy Dix in the trunk. 
 Get him out of here. Take him to Mr. Marcon. I'll follow you as soon as my business here is finished. The Goon departs, leaving Hallenbeck with Pablo and two others. He studies them. Calculates the odds. Verdict: Bad. 
 Yeah, you're gonna write a little story, Joe. About how guilt- stricken you are over Senator Baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way. Yeah... you're so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him, that you're gonna kill yourself. 
 Hey, who's writing this story? You're doing all the good parts. 
 Oh, and, Joe...? Don't forget to include how guilty you are over that cop you murdered. 
 What cop? (CONTINUED) 
 That one. 
 You son of a bitch...! Pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it. He is fueling Joe Hallenbeck's rage. Pity the fool. Hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes. A thoroughly unnerving stare. 
 We don't like Pablo very much, do we, Furry Tom...? There is a pause... And then, incredibly -- Furry Tom answers. A high-pitched, squeaky stuffed cat voice. 
 (as Furry Tom) No, Mr. Hallenbeck, we think Pablo is a motherless fuck who takes it up the ass. Dead silence. Pablo is completely thrown; so are we, for that matter... and then it hits us: Joe is doing ven- triloquism. 
 Shit, is he doing that? Hallenbeck's face remains cold.    Expressionless. 
 Furry Tom, tell Pablo what I'm gonna do to him. 
 (as Furry Tom) You're gong to make Pablo eat all his teeth, Mr. Hallenbeck. (CONTINUED) 
 That's amazing, man! Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom. Inserts his hand, makes the furry head bob back and forth. 
 (as Furry Tom) Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me. That's not very nice. By now, all three hoods are in hysterics. 
 Are you mad, Furry Tom? 
 (as Furry Tom) I don't get mad. I get even. And, with that, Furry Tom's mouth opens -- And EXPLODES, showering stuffing. One of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half his throat is gone... And Furry Thomas BELCHES FIRE again, and the second goon goes down in a spray of blood, and if you haven't guessed already -- Joe has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas. Pablo is a little sharper. A little quicker. He dives forward, knocks the puppet from Joe's hand. Joe drives upward, into Pablo's gut. They reel across the room. Locked in combat. Lamps topple. GLASS BREAKS. Pablo slams Joe's head into the wall.   Leaves a dent. Does it again, a sickening impact... Starts to strangle Joe -- And the truth is, Joe's not thirty anymore. He's not going to make it. The world swims away. Then, as if through a tunnel, Joe notices something beside him... something hanging on the wall. Fights to focus. Breath gone.    Strength gone. Identifies the object: (CONTINUED) 
 You know I don't enjoy doin' this, Jim. Jimmy curls up in a fetal ball.    Marcon paces, shaking his head. 
 I remember how much you hated the pain... You got hooked on Demerol, didn't you...? I'll make a deal with you. Tell me who you talked to, and I'll give you all the painkillers you can swallow. 
 Nobody knows. Just... just me... and Hallenbeck... 
 Now, see, I'd love to believe you. But we are talking about the future of my football team. (CONTINUED) 
 And ain't nothin' more important than my ball club, 'cept maybe my collection of autographed footballs. Got one of yours, you know. (softly) Who'd you talk to, Jimmy? 
 Nobody... Marcon raises the poker. Brings it down on Jimmy's broken arm. 
 Mr. Marcon? (CONTINUED) 
 He's nothing, he can't hurt us. Take him somewhere and kill him. 
 Yes, sir. The Hardguy crosses the room.      Grips Jimmy by the shoulders. With a soft SPIT of sound, his forehead blooms crimson. He collapses, lifeless. At his desk, Marcon whirls, stunned, as: 
 steps through the French doors behind him. He resembles nothing human. A demon in black. Eyes burning. Gun held loosely. An extension of his arm. Marcon reaches for the button to summon help. 
 Don't. He jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly crushing his larynx. Hisses: 
 The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin' kill you. Where's my wife? 
 I... I don't remember, I... Joe shoves on the gun.   The barrel chokes him. 
 My wife. Grabs a pen.   Shoves it in Marcon's hand. 
 The address.    Now! 
 It's... Milo's film studio... 
 Write it down, dumbfuck. (CONTINUED) 
 Jimmy, you okay...? Jimmy stirs. 
 Hurts like hell. Marcon finishes writing. Hallenbeck snatches up the address. Stows it in his pocket. 
 Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got it? (beat) Can you walk, Jimmy? 
 Yeah... I think so -- Joe, behind you...! Too late.    A revolver is cocked a foot from Joe's head. 
 Drop it. It's the same odd voice we heard earlier. The man with the speech impediment. 
 You drop it, asshole, or I kill Marcon. 
 Sorry, but that won't work. I don't care if he lives or dies, now drop the gun. A pause. Once more, Joe calculates the odds.     No dice. He places the rifle on the desk. 
 Walk over there by your friend, Joe. Hallenbeck turns around... and, for once, his jaw drops. He's looking at a man he never thought he'd see again. A man who suffers from facial paralysis ever since his head bounced off the Georgetown turnpike eight years ago. 
 Son of the late senator. The right side of his face doesn't quite match the left. The muscles don't work. Hallenbeck recovers his composure. As Jimmy climbs to his feet, Joe walks over and stands next to him. Two gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear. 
 Well, Goddamn. How's the head, Lou? BAYNARD (STRANGE MAN) Aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just lovely. 
 Next time, Lou, just say no. 
 Shit. This is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face! Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid.   He snaps at Baynard: 
 You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me! 
 Nothing more or less than you'd do for me, Conrad. (turns) I never thought I'd see you again, Joe. 
 Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here? 
 Call it a financial partnership. For a price, I agreed to connect Mr. Marcon to the necessary people in Washington. 
 In other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times. (CONTINUED) 
 (ignores him) But imagine my delight this morning, Joe, when Mr. Marcon informed me of a golden opportunity: a chance to kill my father and frame you for the crime... What can I say, inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain, who could resist? 
 Do I also have you to thank for dragging me into this mess? 
 (sighs) It was I, unfortunately, who bought a forty-dollar bottle of champagne... spoke a little too freely to that hooker. 
 She wasn't a hooker, dickhead. 
 He should know, Jimmy. With a face like that, he's gotta be paying for it. 
 You can die fast or slow, so watch your mouth. Jimmy chimes in: 
 We'd rather watch yours.   It's goofy-lookin'. Marcon has had enough.   He pounds his fist on the desk. 
 Kill them, Goddammit, waste 'em both! 
 Any bright ideas, Joe? 
 Gimmee a minute. 
 Excuse me, could you give him a minute? He's trying to think of a way out of this. (CONTINUED) 
 You know of course, Connie, that you're a dead man. Marcon holds up his hand. 
 Wait. The gunmen lower their weapons. 
 Let's humor this asshole.     What are you talking about? 
 (shrugs) Nothing much, just that I made a phone call from the boat on the way in. 
 You called the cops? Fuck it, they can't prove a thing. 
 Oh, but I didn't call the cops.      I called the mob. Marcon stares at him.   Blinks. 
 See, Connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. If you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government. (beat) I wouldn't be surprised if they put out a contract on you. Of course, I might be able to call it off. Marcon stares him down.    A pause.   Then Marcon smiles: (CONTINUED) 
 He's bluffing. He's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit. Nice try, asshole. (waves his hand) Kill them. 
 (plowing ahead) Then there's the matter of two million dollars. Or didn't you know that watertight suitcases float...? He once again looks Marcon in the eye. 
 I've got your money, Connie. Stashed in the back of a rented Subaru. We'll take you to it. 
 (laughing) Jesus, I don't believe it.    This guy's a riot. 
 (sotto) I don't think it's working, Joe. Try another one. 
 Hell, I'm fresh out. You wanna try one, kid, go for it. A pause. Then, without warning, Jimmy turns -- And slugs Hallenbeck with his good arm. Decks him. 
 Fuck you, Joe, I'm not just gonna stand here and die. Mr. Marcon, he's lying. We do have the money, but it's not in a car, it's in a storage locker. I have the key on me. I'l hand it over if you let me go. Hallenbeck stares in disbelief. The kid's actually trying something. 
 Where is the key, Jimmy? (CONTINUED) 
 It's stashed in my shorts. 
 (nods) All right. Slow and easy. 
 Sure.   Slow and easy. Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls something out, concealed in his fist. We see, but Marcon doesn't: It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist. 
 Promise you'll let me go. 
 Hell with that, son. Hand it over or I'll have you kneecapped. 
 Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad. See, it's one of those new plastic keys. The kind that melt...? And, with that, he hurls it into the fire. So fast that nobody can see just what he threw. 
 I guess nobody gets the money. The two hardguys rush to the fireplace. 
 Pull it out of there! One of them grabs a pair of tongs -- and the SHREDDER EXPLODES. Sprays the two hardguys.    Cuts them to ribbons. Then, several things happen at once: Everybody goes for a gun. Hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol -- As Marcon draws his GUN and FIRES, missing -- Joe RETURNS FIRE, BAM-BAM -- ! Catches Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile -- (CONTINUED) 
 Plastic keys...? The kind that melt? 
 Hey.   Short notice, best I could do. 
 You did fine, junior. 
 Learned it from a pro.     Come on. 
 Son of a bitch! 
 Forget about him. Let's get my wife. He crosses to a parked Mercedes. SHOOTS open the door. Gets in. Pops the ignition package. Hotwires it. The CAR ROARS to life. (CONTINUED) 
 Get in. He's so slick, it's scary. 
 On my way, honey, on my way... 
 Shit, Joe Boy, you wasn't bluffing... He draws his gun. Blows out the glass. Reaches in. Opens the car door. Snatches up the briefcase. CUT TO: 
 slews around the corner races down the street, running without headlights. Lurches to a halt near the mouth of an alley. Jimmy and Joe burst from the car, guns in hand. Hellenbeck is grim, purposeful. Jimmy is nervous. 
 I'm new at this, Joe.   How do we do it? 
 We get in, we get out. Shoot anyone who's not my wife. Check that: Don't shoot me. He jacks a fresh clip into his rifle. CUT TO: 
 inserted in the latch of a back door. Hallenback finds the tumblers. Springs the lock in seconds. 
 seated outside a wooden door. .38 special in a shoulder rig. Sees them, leaps to his feet, gun clearing leather -- Joe blows him out of his socks. TWO-SHOT BURST. Silenced. Guy hits the wall.   Paints it with blood.     Flops, dead. Jimmy and Joe step over him. Joe braces himself. Draws back his foot.       Kicks the door, as: 
 Lights.   Camera.   The wrong kind of action. 
 on a bed, naked. bright lights on her.    Around her, a director.     A cameraman. 
 with a chainsaw. 
 Cut. He throws the hunting knife. It pierces the guy's neck. The chainsaw clatters to the floor. He does the funny little dance peculiar to those with pierced necks. Falls. Dies. And then, mercifully, it's over. Joe crosses to the bed, puts out an arm, and Sarah collapses against him, shaking with sobs. (CONTINUED) 
 I'm here... it's all right... I'm here... He cradles his wife in the middle of a slaughterhouse. CUT TO: EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT Sarah is now dressed, as Joe supports her across the sidewalk toward the stolen Mercedes. He turns to Jimmy. Hands him a set of keys. 
 Drive one of their cars.    They won't be needing them. 
 Where do you want me to go? 
 The two million bucks is still in the Subaru. Parked on Mulholland above Marcon's house. Go pick it up and bring it to the office. We're gonna go get Darian. 
 Yes, massah. He moves off into the parking lot. Hallenbeck says to Sarah. 
 I'll take you and Darian to the office. You can sleep there. 
 Why can't we go home? 
 There's four corpses in the bedroom. 
 Oh. It's a very tiny "oh." ESTABLISHING SHOT - JOE'S OFFICE in the shadow of the freeway. The night wears on.     From the billboard, Gorgeous continues to entice. 
 Jimmy should be here any minute. Then we gotta talk to the cops. Sarah nestles into the crook of his arm. 
 Will the police catch Marcon? 
 Maybe. He's probably in some secret crash pad, packing to leave town. A pause, then Sarah says: 
 I remember when we got married... My friends would talk about their husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer...' I used to say, 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking.' 
 Don't knock it. It's a skill. She turns.   Looks into his eyes. 
 I want to try, Joe.   Do you still want to try? A pause.   He leans in and kisses her tenderly. And, with typically swell timing, a set of headlights rakes across the window, accompanied by the strobing light of a police flasher. 
 Ahh, shit. Looks like the local constable has come to chat. 
 Shall we invite him in? 
 No.   Stay here. I'll deal with it. (CONTINUED) 
 That's not L.A.P.D.... 
 HALLENBECK'S POV 
. In the same glance, he sees there's a dead cop slumped in the passenger seat, and worse, much worse than that: Milo is in the driver's seat. 
 Milo, who steps out of the car and promptly OPENS FIRE on Joe. 
 Son of a bitch! He dives for cover, the turf erupting all around him, as: 
 advances. changing clips.    Methodical.   Precise. Like a robot. He is obsessed.    All vestige of sanity gone. 
 You fucked up my face, Joseph! Joe starts to climb. Scales the wooden structure. Swings himself onto the raised platform. Flattens behind the billboard. 
 Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've got all night, you fucked up my face. He sprays a BURST of GUNFIRE up at the billboard. 
 huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch upward. Through the wooden frame. A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm. An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain. Rolls away from the gunfire. Looks around. Desperate. Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby. He counts to three. 
 I don't fucking believe it. He swerves over to the side and meanwhile 
 watches in dismay as Milo climbs onto the platform... Walks across the front of the billboard. Toward the freeway. Toward Joe. Snarling. Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground. Heaves it. Milo puts up an arm, catches a glancing blow. Blood flows. All it does is piss him off. 
 You ruined my flesh! (CONTINUED) 
. 
 slides straight toward Hallenbeck. 
 below, on the lawn.     She aims Joe's service revolver and says: 
 You just fucking die. 
 She's something, isn't she? Milo pitches forward.     Falls to his death. 
 stares, dumbfounded at Sarah.   She look up at him. A moment passes between them. Around Hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars. HORNS BLARING. Amidst it all, he stands. Beaten. Bloody. Bullet-scarred. Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe. They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says: 
 The car's over on the other side. C'mere, I want to show you something. 
 Somebody broke in and swiped the suitcase from the back seat. Had to be Marcon, right? There is a pause. They both stare at the car. Two million. Down the drain. Except, after a beat... they begin to laugh. First chuckling, then chortling.. Now it's go-for-broke. Jimmy hoots. Joe howls. Jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk -- You can guess what's inside. 
 Son of a bitch got the wrong one! CUT TO: 
 on the dresser of a fancy penthouse suite. Signed by Joe Montana, no less. 
 bustles back and forth, shoves the last of his needed possessions into a travel bag. Hefts it. Puts it near the door. (CONTINUED) 
 
 You got a lot of questions to answer. 
 I know. 
 You'll probably lose your license. 
 I know. 
 Do you care? Hallenbeck smiles. 
 My wife loves me. Bessalo looks at him like he's grown a tail. 
 So. 
 Yeah.     So. 
 (clears his throat) You gonna keep it? Hallenbeck nods. 
 Some of it. (CONTINUED) 
 How much? Hallenbeck frowns. Opens the case. Reaches in -- And plucks out two crisp $100 bills. Stuffs them in a pocket. Jimmy stares at him. 
 (shrugs) My fee. He shuts the case.    Shoves it toward Jimmy. Jimmy leans forward, eyeing the suitcase. 
 Shit, Joe... I got all the money I need. He shoves it back into the center.    Joe nods. 
 I'm thinkin' I could use a partner. (beat) Think you could handle that for awhile? 
 I maybe could handle that.        For awhile. He pours a drink.    Raises his glass on high: 
 Alex the detective. 
 See, Jim, the thing is, life sucks. But you still can't be hangin' around Satan Claus, you know why...? 
 Why? 
 'Cause someday, compadre... Satan Claus and Santa Claus are gonna have a big fight, and you know what...? (beat) Santa's gonna kick some royal ass. He puts a fatherly arm around Jimmy's shoulder, grins:

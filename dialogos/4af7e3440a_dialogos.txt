 (O.S.) Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh boat. There's no trip so horrible that someone won't take it. The idea of the unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret is a deliciously foolish one. We must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh for really sending this myth into orbit. How many pictures did he sell? One? He couldn't give them away. We are so ashamed of his life that the rest of art history will be retribution for Van Gogh's neglect. No one wants to be part of a generation that ignores another Van Gogh. 
. 
: 
 RENE (CONT'D) (sighing theatrically) In this town one is at the mercy of the recognition factor. One's public appearance is absolute. 
 RENE (CONT'D) I consider myself a metaphor of the public. I am a public eye. I am a witness. 
 RENE (CONT'D, O.S.) Part of the artist's job is to get the work where I will see it. 
 RENE (CONT'D, O.S.) When you first see a new picture, you don't want to miss the boat. You have to be very careful because you may be staring at Van Gogh's ear. 
 What'll it be? 
 Ummm. It'll be great. We'll live together in peace. What's her name? (indicates Gina) 
 Gina. What'll it be? 
 Pancakes. 
 Hey - Willie Mays. 
 Willie Mays. 
 Nurse!!! Oh!!! Nurse!!! Carrot juice. Tofu burger. Rapido! 
 We don't serve that - amigo. 
 Fine... A greasy cheeseburger. Fries - and a vodka. 
 (under his breath) Who's that? 
 The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic - writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are.. 
 Who am I? 
 
. 
 Oh yeah.. 
 How's the special today? 
 It's your stomach. 
 Hey. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) What do you think? 
 It's me. I've never been done in maple syrup. Here's a rag. 
 (gently) Gina? 
 Alright. Look at you, staring at this girl, making a mess. 
 How about those pancakes? 
 OK! Goodbye! 
 Pipe down, Lech. Let him order. 
 You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too. 
 I just don't think you're being fair. 
 I need this? 
 I need this? 
 (waving g'bye to Jean) Willie Mays. 
 (to Gina) That's right. You go with them. Make babies 
 Catch you later. 
 What's a job, anyway? (pause) What's wrong with you? 
 GINA (CONT'D) No, don't tell me - you just got fired by your crazy boss. 
 I guess you did. 
 Guess I just got sick of him. 
 Can I walk you home? 
 I think I could do that alone. 
 Wait, I'm in a band....We're at the Mudd Club on Halloween. I'll put you on the list. 
 I hate the Mudd Club. 
 GINA (CONT'D) Have you been camping? You could use a scrub. 
 I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do! 
 (smelling) You do! You definitely do. 
 Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday. 
 I don't go there. Too many party girls. 
 Party girls? Can I call you? 
 (teasing him) Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477-0496. 
 Here, this is for you. I made this. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, mom. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) I met the girl I'm gonna marry. 
 Do you like it here? 
 I'd like it better in Hawaii. 
 "She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby! 
 Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing? 
 Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny. (goes back into 'act') "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken! 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday. (hands it to Benny solemnly) Here - I made this for you. 
 Thanks. (beat) Your dad called again - something about a job. 
 BENNY (CONT'D) You got a date already? 
 (exhaling) We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist - she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me. 
 G'night... See you in court tomorrow. 
 The guy just hit me and I was on the ground!!!! Boom, for real. 
 Hello? 
 (deadpan) I-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline? 
 Yes. My name is Chris. What's yours? 
 Jean Michel. 
 That's a beautiful name. French? 
 Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens. 
 What? Wait a minute... talk to me. 
 (about to sob) Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros! 
 What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that? (pause) What is it - did your girlfriend leave you? 
 No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me. 
 You see? You have someone to live for. 
 No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get. 
 What is it you want?    Respect? I have respect for you, just    for making this call. One philosopher said    "Sadness is a sin against the richness    of the world." Think about it. Feel it. 
 You don't even know me. I want real respect. 
!!! 
 
 (O.S.) (beat) What? What do you want? 
 (breaking loose) Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it. 
 Boom, for real. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) I thought you hated this place? 
 I do. (beat) I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 
 Miss Cardinale... Open up for me, please! 
 LANDLADY (CONT'D) Ohhh, Dios mio! 
 LANDLADY (CONT'D) I just want the rent. 
 Why didn't you say so? Damn! She's asleep! 
 (to Jean) What're you doing? 
 Next Monday. 
 Wanna go get some breakfast? 
 A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago. 
 GINA (CONT'D) Ohh, that's nice. 
 Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver? 
 A what? 
 A Phillips head. From the toolbox. 
 Yeah. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) 'Phillips head,' right? 
 Yeah. 
 You don't have any!!! 
 That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em! 
 GREG (CONT'D) You're holding one in your hand!!! (beat) You've never done this kind of work before, have you? (demonstrating) See, this is a regular screwdriver, and this is a Phillips head. The cross thing... I'll tell you later what all the tools are so you'll know. 
 I need to make a call, Mary. You don't mind, do you? 
 Certainly not. You can use my line. 
 To Paris. Bernard Picasso - (to Mary) You know Bernard - 
 (wincing) Be my guest. 
 Jean? Hold this, please. (beat - he sees why Jean's so distracted) You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too. 
 I didn't know. 
 I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop. 
 (to Milo) I can't tell you how happy I am with this show. 
 (to Milo) My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me? 
 (amused) No. Should I have? 
 I'm a painter, too. 
 Really. Huh. Too bad. 
 Excuse me, would you please move those tools? 
" 
 Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate. 
 I am... On Gina. (beat) Fuck - I didn't think we were actually gonna do this. 
 Concentrate on the ball. Shoot. 
 You're shattering all my myths. 
 About what? 
 Your people. 
 Oh - you mean black people! 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) (changing the subject) How long do you think it takes to get really famous? 
 For a musician or a painter? 
 Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else. 
 Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich. 
 BENNY (CONT'D) First, you have to dress right. 
 BENNY (CONT'D) Then, you have to hang out all the time - with famous people - the right people, the right chicks, the right parties. 
 BENNY (CONT'D) And you gotta do your work all the time when you're not doing that. The same kinda work, the same style - over and over again, so people recognize it and don't get confused. Then, once you're famous, you have to keep doing it the same way, even after it's boring - unless you want people to really get mad at you - which they will anyway. 
 Come on. I hate this. I'm no good at it. 
 Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry - fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart. 
 Who's John Henry? 
 Oh man! Folklore guy - worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike. 
 So then what? 
 He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want? 
 Like I said - my liquid hijack Marlboros. (indicates limo) Check it out. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) Andy Warhol. He's famous and he's not boring. 
 What're you doing? You're doing something. 
 He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these. 
 Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that. 
 DRIVER'S POV: 
'D (to Jean, flustered) Can I help you?. 
 MAITRE'D (CONT'D) (to Jean) Sir...? 
 (sympathetically) I think it's ok. 
'D Of course, Mr. Bischofberger. 
 You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks. 
 Ignorant art? 
 Yeah... Like - stupid, ridiculous, crummy art. 
 Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good. 
 Ten bucks apiece. 
 I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these. 
 You don't even work on your stuff! 
 It doesn't matter how much you worked on 
 I can get ten. 
 I'll take two. This one and... that one. (to Bruno) Can I borrow some money, Bruno? 
 Here. Do you have change? 
 You made a good deal. Here, you can have these, too. 
 BRUNO'S POV: 
 I'll be right back. 
 (to Benny) Check you later, man. 
 Hi Gina. 
 Hi. 
 (O.S.) ... 'APT 20'... The church bells would ring at noon and six a.m.. 24 strokes: How many times we counted them. We called our bed the cloud. And there we'd float. The bathtub was in the kitchen and took forever to fill up. We'd bathe together afterwards. Oh the countless cigarettes and take out Chinese food... The bed was so narrow Three years we made it fit. The sheets were green the sheets were pink the sheets white linen from the past. Little home, farewell, The broken windows and the bodega on the corner. Now from my balcony I look out over all New York... 
 (in disbelief) Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing? 
 C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now. 
 I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear? (she begins to cry) How could you do that to me? 
 ... I'll buy you some new ones. 
 
 Do you know what he's saying? 
 What who's saying? 
 Manzanita.... (translating song) ... if one day I die, and    you read this piece of paper, I want you    to know how much I love you. Although I'll    never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your    hair, your hair, your face, your face' 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) 'Even though you were never mine And you never will be You have a piece of my heart You have, you have, you have...' (he reaches down, wiping off Gina's face) 'Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face.' 
 (O.S.) Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!! 
 (at the window) Come on in! 
 Gina, don't you want any of this? You could use some. 
 See you later. 
 #1 Nice underwear... 
 Basquiat? 
 GINA (CONT'D) Wake up! I'm back! 
 Jean, what did you do to yourself? 
 
 (slapping his face) Don't do this to me. 
 ... What's the matter? 
 (furious) Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself? 
 You're back. 
 It's Monday morning. 
 It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone. 
 You're blaming me? I had to go see my family. 
 I'm your family. 
 Basquiat, what did you take? 
 Nothing special - just some weed. 
 Basquiat, don't lie. (holds up powder) This is smack. 
 You want some? 
 We got beat. 
 For real? 
 You gonna carry that around all night? 
 Yeah... I'll paint on it. 
 You did that, didn't you? 
 I gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here for awhile. 
 Do one for me and it's free. How's that? 
 #1 Check this out, Rene. 
 (singing along) "The name of the game is survival, You learn it in jail upon your arrival!" 
 #2 Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment! 
 Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that? 
 #2 Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit! 
: 
 (noticing him) Oh my, there goes the neighborhood. Who's house is this, anyway? 
 RENE (CONT'D) (to Artist #2) That's what I like about you straight boys. You're so sensitive!!! (resumes singing) 
 #1 Rene! Come here, man! 
 I gotta go pee. 
 RENE (CONT'D) (to himself) Who did this? (beat - louder) Who did this? 
 #2 I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment. 
 #3 I know who did that. That's Jean Michel's. He's right here, man... 
 #3 Fuck, man, where'd he go? Where's Jean? 
 (to himself) It's fucking amazing. Motherfucker's got to put a crown on it. 
 #1 (yelling from the window) Rene, man, check this out. Whoa... He's kinda cute. 
 Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick. 
 #2 How do you know? 
 Just look at him. 
 #3 Whoa - check it out. It's him! 
: 
 
! 
 #2 That's the same guy who did this painting. 
 I know that. Don't let him get away. 
 
 Hey, wait up!!! 
 You heard of Albert Milo. I made    that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't    you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know    who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a    star. 
 Can you put me in the ring with him? 
 I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates. (beat) But those big boys know how to fight. They 
 Jean Michel Basquiat. 
 Sounds famous already. 
 Oh child... You got no respect. Didn't anyone teach you how to mount paintings? 
 RENE (CONT'D) This is a very important season in New York. One's public appearance is absolute. (beat - a man approaches) Oh!!! Louise!!! I'd like you to meet Jean Michel Basquiat - (beat) SAMO. This is Henry Geldzahler. 
 Ohh... SAMO. I've heard a lot about you. I love your graffiti. 
 I was a kid then. 
 (to Rene) How much are these? 
 You or the museum? 
 It's for me. 
 Five. 
 I'll take it. 
 That's five thousand dollars. (hissing to Jean) He's from the Metropolitan Museum of Art so suck my pussy, you star. 
 You look fucking beautiful, beautiful. 
 Well thanks! 
 This is Jean Michel, whose work I told you about. 
 (to Jean) Rene hasn't stopped talking about your paintings. Haven't I seen you in my gallery? 
 No. 
 (to Rene) You haven't been by lately. 
 I didn't have the subway fare. My Medicare ran out. 
 
 I don't know. 
 You're doing well. 
 I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio? 
 You name it, I paint there. 
 Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card. 
 You want a drink? 
 No thanks. (to Rene) But I'd like one of these paintings. 
 Who's that? 
 You kidding? That's Annina Nosei. Jean's been in her gallery a thousand times. (to Jean) You slut. How do you know Bruno Bischofberger? (to Gina) He's only the biggest art dealer in Europe. 
 I had lunch with him once. 
 Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai? 
 (a little upset) I hadn't thought about it. 
 (in perfect Hawaiian) Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee - 
 Staten Island would be ok. 
 Do you wanna marry me? 
 Kind of a family portrait. 
 GINA (CONT'D) It looks done. 
 Think so? 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) ... babies. 
 You mean babies with you? 
 What's wrong with me? 
 You're your own baby. 
 Who is it? 
 (O.S) Annina Nosei. 
 Who? 
 GINA (CONT'D) (through the crack) Hello? Oh. Come in. 
 Is Jean Michel here? 
 No. 
 I'm here to see some work. 
 Aren't they? 
 How much for these five? 
 You should talk to him about this. 
 (continuing to stare at the work) Um... Do Rene and Jean have a contract together? 
 I really think you should talk to him about this. 
 When? 
 How about right now? 
 (calling back) Be ready in a minute! 
 Honk the horn again, will you please? 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) (annoyed) You're late. 
 What's the rush, John Henry? 
 I ain't John Henry. 
 Good. 
 What's your fuckin' problem, anyway? 
 (inhaling) I don't really have any problems. 
 Good. What do you have? 
 What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me. 
 (mortified) 'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?' 
 That's not how I meant it. (beat) For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell. 
 Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you! 
 I've got to find the switch. 
 Here it is. 
 3rd night I called    him 'boy' He sed "don't call    me 'boy'" "Well Then don't call me    'Boss'" That Was the end for us    and I've Been seeing him for    2 1/2 years. In kangaroo court I    want to be 
 Oh man! That's one looks famous already. 
 RENE (CONT'D) You are a willful boy. How'm I s'posed to write about you if you keep changing everything? 
 RENE (CONT'D) Uh huhh... Band practice? (to Jean) It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...? 
 (quietly) Fuck... (to Rene) I forgot about that. 
 Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts - you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett.. 
 Tony Bennett... What do you mean? 
 Singing on stage and painting in your spare 
 I didn't know Tony Bennett painted. 
 My point exactly. 
 RENE (CONT'D) So keep painting. 
 Yes, Boss. (beat) If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement? 
 You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true. (beat) There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know? 
 So what? 
 So shut up and keep painting.. 
 (touched) What time is it? 
 5:11. 
 That one's for you. 
 Thanks... I'll take it tonight. 
 I can't. After the show. 
 Hey - it's the big A.M.. 
 Rene's been telling me about your work. 
 I don't know. 
 When's your show? 
 Not sure. How was yours? 
 I haven't decided yet. (beat) Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you. 
 How about now? 
 See you at your opening. Thanks. 
 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Ohhh, Albert Milo, what a pleasure to meet you. 
 (O.S.) This is Rene Ricard. 
 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) We're Tom and Cynthia Kruger - nice to have met you. 
 JEAN'S POV 
 
 (O.S) Tom and Cynthia Kruger. 
 (O.S) I know. 
 This is Jean Michel Basquiat. (beat) You've seen the SAMO graffiti everywhere. That's his. This is the true voice of the gutter. 
 We've seen the graffiti. I work on Wall Street. And I've heard wonderful things about the paintings. Everybody's talking about you. 
 Yeah. 
 Here's a very good example of his recent work that's not spoken for yet. (beat) He's got to work in a basement. He's got so much energy that if he worked in a place with a window, he'd jump right through it. Most of these are reserved already. After this week, this work will not be available. 
 (to his wife) ... I don't know.... This one's nice, but I don't know if I could live with it. That green is so... institutional. 
 #1 (enthusiastically) Yo, man, you're a damn lucky nigger selling this shit! 
 You like it? 
 #1 Not bad. Yeah, I do. 
 I'm fascinated by his choice of crossing out words that way. 
 Yes, well, they are more meaningful in their absence, no? 
 #1 (to Jean, joking) What does it mean? 
 I like this one, but that green... 
 Y'want me to make it a nice shit brown? 
 Beg pardon? 
 Hi. This is Gina. 
 They're something like Dubuffet's... That... childlike quality. 
 I like this one. If it were just another color.. 
 Get a fucking decorator. If you buy one, you'll have to change your whole lives - maybe even sell your kids! (to Annina) These paintings aren't even done yet!!! 
 (O.S.) I think we'll take the green one. 
: 
 I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie. 
 You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie. 
 Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies. 
 You only want one Big Mac? 
 Yeah... And make it three apple pies. 
 How can I ever thank you? 
 (with a smile) I'd like to squeeze your titties. 
 Come on. 
 Wanna Mac? 
 No, I'd like the scarf. 
 Have a Mac. 
 I don't eat junk food. 
 Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town. (beat) You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name? 
 You're a fast mover. 
 No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 What's that? 
 A present I picked up for you. 
 It's beautiful. Thanks. 
 (tenderly) You look like an angel. 
 "BOOM #2 A CAT POURING TACKS ON ITS TONGUE" 
 JEAN'S POV 
 (wildly enthusiastic) Jean, man!!! Let's make a record! 
 (slyly, intimately) You finally did it. 
 #2 (pointing to Jean, sneering) He's so fulla shit. 
 #3 (O.S.) How much is he getting for these? 
 Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket. 
 My jacket? Gee, great... (he Polaroids Jean) Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that! 
 Yeah, I met her already. 
 (shaking Jean's hand) You should be pleased. It's a great show...I'm having a dinner later at Mr. Chow's for Albert. You should come. 
 You'll like it. Everyone'll be there. 
 Jean, your parents are here. 
 Hi Dad. Hi Nora. 
 Congratulations. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 (continuing to Jean's father) You must be very proud. 
 I am! 
 How does it feel to have a genius in the family? 
 It feels... good! 
 (to Rene) I'll be right back. 
 We love our painting. 
 Which painting? 
 The green one. 
 Oh yeah. 
 We got a couch to match. 
 She's only kidding! 
 Willie Mays. A Toast. 
 Not now, ok? 
 Jean Michel, my man. Nice party. Should we step into my office? 
 That's alright. I'm cool now. 
 A gift! I was just trying to give you a gift! 
 I gotta go. 
 
 Of the painters, please. 
 He said 'of the painters!' Hey - Albert! Get in the picture! 
 Hey, Jean, I'd like you to meet my wife....and my parents. Mom, Dad, this is Jean Michel Basquiat. 
 (frowning at her son) Don't do that. (beat) Hello, Jean. 
 Hi, John... Are your parents here? 
 Well. (inhaling) My dad's here with his wife. My mom couldn't make it. 
 (waving it away) No thanks. 
 (to Jean) I'd like to do a show with you. (pointing to "Rene 5:11" painting) I'm especially interested in that one. I'd like to buy it for myself. 
 I wasn't gonna sell this one. 
 You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it. 
 Sure, ok.. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour. 
 It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there. 
 Bye, Jean. 
 (hissing) You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother - when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit. 
 I'll make you another one. 
 Forget it. 
 Rene - 
 SHHHHHH. Later. (speaking to himself) "What is it about art, anyway......" 
 RENE (O.S.; CONT'D) ... that we give it so much importance? Artists are respected by the poor because what they do is an honest way to get out of the slum using one's sheer self as the medium. The money earned is proof pure and simple of the value of that individual... The Artist. 
 RENE (O.S.CONT'D) The picture a mother's son does in jail hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is possible even in the most wretched. And this is a much different idea than the fancier notion that art is a scam and a rip-off. But you could never explain to someone who uses God's gift to enslave that you have used God's gift to be free." 
 I really... admire you. 
 Me? Why? 
 
 That's great. 
 Would you check out my studio some time? 
 Sure. I'd be glad to. 
 Here? 
 (calm, relieved) What's your name, man? 
 They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge. 
 Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job? 
'D Good evening. 
 Hi, Jean. 
 Jean, everyone loved your show. 
 Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York. 
 Saddle River's in New Jersey. 
 Saddle River, New York! 
 It's in New Jersey. 
 New York. 
 I think it's in New Jersey. 
 It's in New York. 
 Oh, I didn't know that. 
 (to Francesco) You finish it. 
 (to Jean) 
 Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him. 
 I'd like a glass of your best champagne, please? (reading) This is an enormously important season in New York, and to make a false step could have severe repercussions for years. We are no longer collecting art, we're buying individuals. 
 Oh shut up, Rene. 
 Everything's over your head, Andy. Even Mr. Chow's menu. (beat - to Jean) Thanks for not inviting me 
 
 RENE (CONT'D) I'm starving. You can't buy    advertising like this. This is the most    glamorous dinner you'll have here this    fall. How about some of that imitation    crab? 
 MR. CHOW I'm not paying for the drawing with crab. It's a present to my friends. It's my birthday. 
 Isn't he great? Thanks, Jean. 
 RENE (CONT'D) He owes me one. 
 MR. CHOW You're too much, Rene. Get this guy out of here. 
 I haven't eaten yet!!! 
 RENE (CONT'D) Hands off me, you faggots! I'm going. I'm going...I've kept Diana Vreeland waiting too long, anyway. 
 Wow... That was a nice drawing, too, Jean. Maybe you should do another one. 
 MR. CHOW (exhausted) Some other time. 
 (to Jean) It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio. 
 Sure. 
 (O.S.) ... had twenty-three one man shows, been in forty three group shows from Zurich to Tokyo.. 
 INTERVIEWER (O.S, CONT'D) ... had over fifty articles written about you, switched galleries - how many times? - DJ'd in the hottest clubs - 
 INTERVIEWER   (CONT'D) ... one of the youngest    artists ever to be included in the Whitney    Biennial, also produced a rap record.    It's said you're quite the ladies man -    even dated Madonna for a couple months!!! (takes a breath) All at the ripe old age    of 24. One might ask: is there anything    left for Jean Michel Basquiat to do? 
 INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? (nervous laugh) 
 I hate this. Turn that off. 
 We're running a little late. 
 INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) (to crew) Ready? 
 INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) ... Can you... decipher this for us? 
 Decipher? 
 Yes. What do they... stand for? 
 They're just words. 
 Yes, I understand - but where do you take them from? 
 Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from? (beat) Everywhere. 
 (pointing to a detail) What are they? 
 (smiling mischievously) Leeches. A long list of leeches. (looking at some frames Shenge's working on) It looks good like that. 
 Hmmm. And 'Parasites.' (beat) You seem to be a Primal Expressionist. 
 You mean like an ape? 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) (chewing, spilling) A primate? 
 Well, you said that. (beat - looks at notes) You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you? 
 Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it? 
 Yes, but as a black painter - 
 I use a lot of colors - not only black. 
 What? 
 I'm not black. 
 You're not? 
 Not what? 
 Not black. 
 No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican. 
 Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he? 
 (growing weary) Yup. 
 Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home? 
 We don't hang them at home, y'know - just in the streets.. 
 I see.. (beat) And... How do you respond to being called - hmmm... (peruses some notes) - yes, "the pickaninny of the art world." 
 (smiles - hurt, stunned) Who said that? 
 Why, that's from Time Magazine. 
 No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy. 
 Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution? 
 INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) Let me... just... open something up here. You come from a nice, middle class, respectable home. Your father is an accountant. Why did you at one time live in a cardboard box in Tompkins Square? 
 INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto? 
 Are those the only two possibilities? (cramming a French Fry into his mouth) You wanna French fry? 
 OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work? 
 Should there be? 
 Tell me about it. What are you angry about? 
 Mmmm. I don't know. I don't remember. 
 (to COUNTERMAN) Can I have some caviar, please? 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) I'd like to taste it, first. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) Is that the best quality you have? 
 Yeah, it's the best one. 
 I'll take the whole tin. 
 It's three thousand dollars! 
 I'll take it. (wipes nose with sleeve.) Andy, gimme three thousand dollars. (beat) Just the caviar - I'll get the rest. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) You check everyone's bills or just mine? 
 When I was little, my brother and I used to have two ducks as pets. We called them the Rodriguez Brothers. 
 I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me. 
 That's good. At least they're interested. 
 Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a SAMO tag on it. (beat) The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?" 
 Wow... Stop giving them away. (beat) I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me? 
 Yeah - I'd do that... You could teach me. 
 Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent. 
 Cool. 
 My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well. 
 Let's leave this town and go someplace. 
 Let's go to    the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's    most famous sculptures all in these giant    plaster replicas. It's really great. It's    in Pittsburg. 
 Ouch.. 
 What's wrong? 
 That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina. 
 Do you still love her? 
 Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her. 
 Well, have you asked her to come back? 
'D Mr. Basquiat - what a pleasure to see you again. 
 Hey George, what's up? 
 So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo. 
 He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him? 
 Don't you think he's using you? 
 Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me. 
 Would you like to see the wine list? 
 Chateau Latour '64, please. 
 So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but - whatever. I'm really excited. (beat) And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published. 
 How is he? 
 Pretty much the same. 
 Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole. (beat) Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're - 
 (referring to an extra loud snicker from execs) What's that about? 
 
 That is amazing. What year is it? 
 George? 
 I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat. 
 See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Yeah, just put their bill on my tab. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Very well. 
 (continuing) Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were - 
 I don't believe it, Jean - they're picking straws. 
 
 I wish you niggahs could get it togeth- ahhhhhh. 
 What's this for? 
 The tip. 
 You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't. 
 What's his name? 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) I have to go to the bathroom. 
 (re: the paintings) What do you think? 
 
 It's always how you would do it. This is my version. 
 You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime. 
 Why, so you could humiliate me? 
 No, I wanted to make a painting of you. 
 
 A little more to the right, Frank. OK... Good. Now up... You got a little more? 
 What's with the wigs? 
 I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents. 
 You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig? 
 Piss painting? 
 I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green. 
 How come you're not peeing on them yourself? 
 I don't like beer. 
 If you ever want me to shit on 'em, just ask. You could finger paint. 
 That was my favorite part! 
 We can do better. It needed more white. 
 Jean, you make me feel worthless. You're so famous. 
 I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? 
 Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you. 
 People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work. 
 ANDY    WARHOL Bruno called. In    Europe, people are saying you're gonna die    from drugs. They think they can cash in    on your death. 
 When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now. 
 If you say so. You sleep until 5:00 p.m. You call at four in the morning. You never show up anywhere on time - if you show up. You're painting out everything I do! 
 That's better. 
 I can't even see what's good anymore. 
 After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what 
 That would be a pity because you're a real painter. 
 Here's the poster for the show. 
 
 Name? 
 Elke. 
 Number? 
 
 Name? 
 Monica. 
 Number? 
 477-0258. 
 Yo, Frank. 
 This is really great. What a nice place. 
 FRANK (CONT'D) Have you met Christine? 
 I don't think so. 
 Would you sign one of those for me? 
 YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee. 
 Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you? 
 Uh-oh! 
 I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions! 
 Boom. 
 Boom? As in ordnance? Are your letters 
 (to Ram, re: Jean) Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT. 
 You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man. 
 That's ignorant. 
 That ain't ignorant - that's just stupid. (beat - to Christine) Can I get you a bowl of gumbo? 
 This interrogation is not over! 
 Albert Milo? Ugh! He's just a pressmonger. That's all these people do. 
 #2 You know, I love Jean's early work. It's really got something. But this collaboration with Andy - maybe they thought it was a joke... I mean - whose work is it? Jean's or Andy's? 
 His early work? He's only twenty-six! 
 Hey, Rene. 
 Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business. 
 
 RENE (CONT'D) (loudly) You're asking me? Nigga, please. After the way you treated me? This is the first time I've heard from either of you in months! I had to crash this party! You treated me like a suede biscuit. Rene don't play that! I can't get him off drugs! I don't even talk to him any more!!! 
 (to Bruno) What's a suede biscuit? 
 (amused) Hey, what's this? It says right here you're Andy's... "lapdog"... 
 Here... Pull over. 
 
 BUILD A FORT SET IT ON FIRE" 
 What's up? 
 #1 Mind your own fuckin' business. 
 (recognizing his work) That's mine. 
 That ain't yours, man. Some asshole named SAMO did this. 
#3 He's dead. That's what I heard. 
 #2 He ain't dead yet. He's gonna kill himself. That's why all those art fags in Soho are paying more every time we bring one of these in. 
 #1 Stupid SAMO... Hardly any of this shit left. 
 #3 This one's damn nice. I say we hang onto it if he's almost dead. 
 There you go. Now it's worth more. 
 #2 What's he saying? 
 I'm SAMO... I'm SAMO... 
 #3 (bending close) He says he's SAMO. 
 #1 He wish. 
 Paint it out. 
 Out? 
 Yeah... Maybe just his arms. 
 It's Andy again. 
 Still not here. 
 - In this corner? 
 (not looking) Yeah.. 
 You want me to put it here? 
 Use your fucking instinct. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) Don't try to make art. Just paint like a housepainter. 
 It's Maria Portos. What should we do? 
 Why don't you try letting her in, Steve - I mean Shenge. 
 Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it! 
 Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you. 
 (showing him the clogs) These reminded me of you, the clogs. I found them in Amsterdam. 
 MARIA (CONT'D) How are you? 
 Fine. 
 You remember Ellen? (looking around) What are you working on? 
 How much is something like that? 
 Fifteen. Reasonable. 
 It's unfinished. (to Shenge) How 'bout some blue in the corner? 
 Blue? Where? 
 What's wrong with you today? 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) Don't look at me like that. It hurts my feelings. 
 I love these. 
 
 (to Jean) Who are you selling these through now? 
 Well, that's better. (to Maria) You can buy direct from me. 
 Look at these - silkscreens? What're you? Andy Warhol Junior? It's like - not even handmade anymore. 
 Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage? 
 I need a dealer. 
 You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room. 
 Hey Jean! (to Mary) It'll never fit. 
 It'll be ok. 
 You better take a look. Why's your door so small? The ceilings are sixteen feet and your door's the size of a mouse hole! 
 
 (to Jean) You doing anything right now? 
 Naa.. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 See ya in an hour. (to Mary) So what do you think? 
 Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it. 
 I'm here. 
 OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock. 
 This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else.. 
 Do you ever get sick of it? 
 Of what? 
 The whole thing - painting. 
 No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every 
 What about the shit they write? 
 You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them. 
 I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out. 
 As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese? 
 (O.S.) Papa, the TV's broken... Will you fix it please? 
 Alright. I'll be right up. 
 (to Jean) Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different. 
 
 Some of them. 
 Stand still. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) See you later. 
 Thanks 
 Where's Jean? 
 He just left. 
 SUPER: "FEBRUARY 22, 1987" 
 B.B. It's me - Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year? 
 
 What do you mean? 
 You haven't heard? Andy's dead. 
 
 Hello? Gina? 
 Who is it? 
 
 Hey, come here! Please. Just for a second. Open the door. 
 Open up! Open up! 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) My mother's inside. 
 Come back tomorrow. Visiting hours are over. (beat) Don't cause any trouble. 
 I'm not here to visit... I wanna take her home. 
 Don't cause any trouble. 
 
 (O.S.) Willie Mays. 
 Willie Mays... Nice to see you. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) How's Gina? You guys getting along? 
 She's good. 
 I guess it was a long time ago. 
 Come on, let's get out of here. 
 Sit down! You're gonna fall out! 
 
 Drugs??! 
 Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health! 
 You starting a hospital? 
 Just ring it up. I don't need a bag. (to Benny) Try this tabouli - it's great... 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) My mom told me this... Or was it a dream? 
 (O.S.) There was this little prince with a magic crown. An evil warlock kidnapped him, locked him in a cell in a huge tower and took away his voice. There was a window made of bars. The prince would smash his head against the bars hoping that someone would hear the sound and find him. The crown made the most beautiful sound that anyone ever heard. You could hear the ringing for miles. It was so beautiful, that people wanted to grab the air. They never found the prince. He never got out of the room. But the sound he made filled everything up with beauty. 
 (O.S) It's definitely time to get out of here. 
 BASQUIAT (CONT'D) Hawaii? Fuck Hawaii. Let's go to Ireland. We'll stop in every bar and have a drink.

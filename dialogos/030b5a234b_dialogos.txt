 (Hungarian, subtitled) And porkolts. You know porkolts? 
 (Hungarian, subtitled) Yes, I've had it. 
 It's very good. Better than goulash. But you won't get it in Budapest now. 
 Why's that? 
 All the pigs have gone to Moscow. 
 When do I get to meet your friend? 
 I'll take you to him. Not eating? 
 Would you excuse me a moment? 
 No firing! 
 (Scottish accent) I wish I could have done more, Control. 
 (Coolly) You did all you could, Percy. (Beat) Well, a man should know when to leave the party. 
 What about Smiley? 
 Smiley is leaving with me. 
 You little prick Esterhase. 
 P.O.V. 
 (In Russian) Shall we begin? 10. 
 (through glass) This is private property. Who are you? 
. 
 Minister Lacon. 
 What do you want? 
 I want to talk to Control. And I want breakfast. 
 (of the bike) Has that been cleared? 
 I'm not bloody chaining it outside. Mind you, probably no safer in here, with you bunch of cut-throats. 
 Thought I'd get a glimpse of the new girl. Before Bland gets to her. He seen her yet? 
 Oh yes. Down first thing. 
'S P.O.V. - 
 You may fuck me, Belinda, but you still have to call me sir in the morning. 
 (O.S.) Sorry Peter. 
 Peter Guillam... 
 (Surprised) Hello, Peter. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Have I time to change? 
 Are we going far? 
 How's your mother? 
 Very well. (referring to the window) Is this where he got out? 14. 
 Mmm, I came back in and it was wide open. (beat) Do send her my love. Apologies for singling you out, but... very sensitive matter... 
 LACON (CONT'D) If one can't trust one's own nephew... You know who he was? 
 Ricki Tarr, sir. One of my scalp- hunters. He's been on the wanted list for a year. Last job was Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for a Russian convention. 
 Why is he on the wanted list? 
 (beat) He killed our man in Istanbul. Cut his throat. Been on the run since then. 
 My God. In my own home... my family... The bloody animals you people employ! 
 And how are you George? Missing one's work, one's buddies? 
 Oh, I think I manage pretty well, thank you. 
 Your wife, the lovely Ann? She's in the pink, and so on. 
 Very well. (Beat) Very bonny... 
 Do you know this man Tarr? 
 (Mildly) I recruited him actually. In Penang. Good with women. Likes to talk. What did he say to you? 
 He said he had some intelligence for Control. Had no idea he was dead. The news obviously hadn't reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he said he would only tell it to someone outside the Circus. If he couldn't have a Minister, he would settle for the Under-secretary. Lucky me. 
 LACON (CONT'D) He said there's a mole. Right at the top of the Circus. And that he's been there for years. 
 I was sad to see you go, George. I thought it was shabby, very shabby. (MORE) 16. 
 LACON (CONT'D) But the Minister agreed with Sir Percy. New broom, clean sweep, wheat from the chaff and all that. And to be fair, Percy has had some marvellous results since you and Control left... 
 LACON (CONT'D) Anyway, it does mean you're rather ideally placed to look into this matter for us now, doesn't it? Outside the family? 
 I am retired, Oliver. 
 Thing is, some time back, when Control was still alive, he came to me with a similar suggestion. 
 LACON (CONT'D) He never mentioned his suspicions to you? 
 No. 
 I just thought... with you being "his man", so to speak. 
 What did you say to him? 
 (Beat) I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had got the better of him and he was pulling his own house down. That does happen in your business. And that bloody mess in Budapest... 
 LACON (CONT'D) Damn it, George, this is your generation, your legacy! (MORE) 17. 
 LACON (CONT'D) If there's any truth in this you'd think you'd want to... 
 (Beat) I'll keep Peter Guillam. And there's a retired special branch man. Mendel. I'd like to have him. 
 Yes, yes. Do your own housekeeping. Good man. 
 LACON (CONT'D) Damn thing cost a fortune. Three years of lessons and all I hear is Edelweiss. You and Ann never had children, did you? 
 No, we never did. 
'S P.O.V. 
 (O.S.) My friend just wants peace and quiet in order to work, Mrs Pope- Graham, no disturbances. 
 Her real name is plain Graham. Added the Pope for a touch of class. 
 MENDEL (CONT'D) Best informant I ever had. 
 Control lived with his sister didn't he? 
 Basingstoke. Not much of a paper- trail as you can imagine. His pension and she owns a block of bedsits in her own name in West London. 
 We should... 
 ... Webb and Bryson are the letting agents. Properties in half of the west end judging by this list... 
 We're only looking for short term rentals. Within the last year. 
 (Reading from the list) A Miss Hilliard. L. Cavaleri? D Weaver, M Crowley, M Cushing. F. Farling. G. Hiaasen. (MORE) 20. 
 MENDEL (CONT'D) A Mrs Hawcombe. R. Kee. M. Kass. H Staunton... 
 MENDEL (CONT'D) K. Menzies... 
 How long was H. Staunton a tenant? 
 (Consulting the list) Still is. Been renting for a few years now. Something? 
 (Musing) Howard Staunton. Control used to say he was England's greatest chess master. Died in eighteen seventy- four. 
 Help you with something Bill? 
 Looking for his Majesty. 
 (sullenly) He's walking the battlements. 
 (in Hungarian, subtitled) Much obliged. 
 (Without turning) Roy. 
 It's the Yanks. They want to come in and talk. 22. 
 Of course they do. We have Witchcraft. And they don't. 
 Thank you. Anywhere will do. 
 "KARLA". 
 (Wryly) That enough for you to be getting on with? 
 (Beat) No. Peter, I need you to do something for me... 
'S P.O.V. 
 (V.O.) I want to see the records of staff recently retired. While you're there get the handbook on staff duties... and the diagram of the Circus's reorganization under Alleline... 
 (Suspicious) Sorry Peter, didn't know you were doing... whatever you were doing...? 
 Trying not to bleed to death. Fawley's got a first aid kit in one of his drawers. Get me a plaster will you? 
 (without looking at him) Heard you had an accident. 
 Cut it on a drawer handle. (Beat) When are we going to get some new furniture round here? 
 I'll have a word with Esterhase, Peter. We'll make it a priority on the top floor. 
 Lunch. 
 Want some company? 
 Tell you the truth, I'm in no hurry to get back up there... 
 Smothered by the Mothers. 25. 
 Something like that. Those old birds, all pining for Control. Percy still can't get a decent cup of tea out of them. Still, I imagine it takes time. 
 What does? 
 Loyalty. 
. 
 (Quickly) Here. 
 (Suddenly) What do you think of Datsuns? 
 What? 
 Datsuns. Just got one. Wife made me. Hatchback. Caught sight of myself in it, driving past a shop window and I thought to myself "Who's that old fucker?" 
 Citroen. 26. 
 French? Ooh la la... 
 Jerry Westerby, dismissed December 4th. And... Connie Sachs, retired November 28th. That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out. 
 I know that car. 
 On our way to La Bohème. The Minister wondered if there was anything to report? 
 Not much, I'm afraid. We were just discussing the departure of Connie Sachs. I wonder how Research manages without her. 
 Probably relieved. She always struck me as unhinged. 
 That was one of her talents. 
 (Indicating the chess set) Looking a little unhinged yourself, George. 
 (Distracted) Hmm? 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Yes, I suppose I am. Perhaps that's what we have to become? A little paranoid? 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) (To Lacon) Your "clean sweep." What if the Mole was actually behind that sweep? What if each of us, whether we knew it or not, represented a threat to the Mole? 
 (Unconvinced) Control lost his position because of that fiasco in Budapest... that poor chap...? 28. 
 Jim Prideaux. 
 Yes. Yes, he did. 
 How did you get this? This is Witchcraft material. 
 Control was out. And Alleline was in. Thanks to... 
 (V.O.) ... Alleline's "special source." 
 (V.O.) There is no connection. 
 (V.O.) Everything is connected. 
 Return to Oxford please. 
 "SACHS." 
'S P.O.V. 
 (Of the tea) Oh, I brought... 
 (eyeing it hungrily) Not supposed to. Doctor's orders. 
 You left the Circus shortly after I retired... 
 I didn't leave. I was dismissed. Chucked out on the rubbish heap. (Beat) Like you. 
 (Ignoring this) Why? 
 "Lost my sense of proportion." That's what that personnel cow said. Wouldn't let go of a bone. 
 Which bone? 
 Polyakov. 32. 
 Polyakov. 
 Cultural Attaché Polyakov. 
 Stationed where? 
 Here. London. Turned up in sixty five. And I had a feeling, as soon as I laid eyes on him. But that little swine Toby Esterhase told me I was seeing Spies under the bed. 
 Esterhase said that? 
 He had him graded Persil. Whiter than white. And that was that. 
 But you disagreed? 
 Pretty Polly? Very military bearing for someone who's never supposed to have been in the army. But, he was good. Went to Embassy functions, lectures. I love a man who lives his cover. Never put a foot wrong. 
 (Beat) Never? 
 (As if summoning him) Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly... 
 (V.O.) ... the busiest culture vulture that Embassy ever had. 
 (V.O.) What did you do? 
 (V.O.) I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline. I said - "Polyakov is a Karla-trained Hood if ever I saw one. And if he's here it's because he's running a mole." 
 (V.O.) What did they say? 
 (Hard) You're to leave Polyakov alone. You're becoming obsessed with him. 
 Hate the real world. (Beat) What does it matter? Old Circus is gone anyway, apart from Bill Haydon. Better off out of it. (Beat)I know you never liked him. 
 (Sharply) What nonsense. What on earth makes you say that? 
 (Surprised) I don't know. 35. 
. 
 (Chiding) It was the war, Connie. 
 A real war. Englishmen could be proud then. 
 (O.S.) (In Russian) ... The Priest is surprised to see General Secretary Krushchev... 
 ... He says "Father, father, I've just had sex with two 17 year old girls." The Priest says "That's quite a sin, but you're an Atheist, General Secretary..." 
 POLYAKOV (CONT'D) "... why are you telling me?" 
 (O.S.) ... Krushchev says "I'm seventy- seven, I'm telling everyone." 
 Step into my lair. 
. 
 (To Smiley) Sit down and take a look at this nonsense. 
 CONTROL (CONT'D) Report by Soviet High Command on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea. Just what the Admiralty have been begging us for some information on. 
 (Engrossed) Where did you get it? 
 I didn't. Percy and his little cabal walked in with it. 
 (Protesting "cabal") Control... 
 Shut up, Esterhase. 
 If it's genuine it's gold-dust. (Beat) But its topicality makes it suspect. 38. 
 Smiley is suspicious, Percy. Smells a fake. 
 Where does it come from? What's the access? 
 Percy doesn't feel like telling. 
 A new secret source of mine. 
 But how could he possibly have access to...? 
 He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy making. 
. 
 (Faintly) We? 
 Percy and his pals have bypassed us, Smiley. Gone straight to the Minister. Everyone's very excited. Percy's to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret. 
 The Minister agrees with me that too many secrets are blown around here. Too much failure, too many scandals, too little solid intelligence! 
 Luckily Percy's cabal has come to save us. 
 (Bulldozing on) It's all office politics here. 
 Percy does have a point, Control. We should be fighting communism, not each other. 
 Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners... 
 Your bloody Yanks! 
 (Shouting) And we've had enough! There's going to be changes, Smiley! Changes. 
 We need to decide if we're part of the past, or part of the future. 
 (Contemptuous) I should have left you where I found you. 
 Control, if we could all just... 
 OUT! ALL OF YOU! 
 (Cautiously) If Witchcraft is genuine... 
 I don't trust miracles. 40. 
 (Of the tea) Courtesy of Mrs P. You been up all night? 
 Yes. 
 What's that? 
 Request for a thousand pound's in cash from the reptile fund. 
 What for? 
 For a Mister Ellis. 
 Who's Ellis? 
 It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names. 
 What's so strange about that then? 
 The date. Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why was (MORE) 41. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) someone giving him a thousand pounds two months later? 
 Hand those out. 
 (After a moment) Come down here. 
 PRIDEAUX (CONT'D) (Identifying him) Boy with the marble. 
 Yes sir. 
 Gave me a turn up there, parked on the horizon. Thought you were a Juju man. What's your name? 
 Sir, Roach, sir. Bill. I'm a new boy. 
 New arrival, eh? Middle of year? What's the story? 
 (Blushing) My mother and father... my father's left, so... 
 Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone ever call you that? 
 No sir. 
 Known a lot of Bills. They've all been good `uns. What you good at? 
 Nothing sir. 
 You're a good watcher though eh? Us loners always are. No one else spotted me when I turned up here. Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as he's got his specs on. Right? 
 (Gratefully) Yes sir. 
 Free period, isn't it? Don't waste it down here. 
 Hello Mister Smiley. You remember me. 
 Hello, Ricki. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) You missed a wedge. 
 Losing my touch. 
 Where've you been, Ricki? 
 Here, there. Run out of places now. They're gonna kill me. 
 Who is? 
 Your lot. Or their lot. Whoever gets me first. I'm innocent, by the way. Within reason. (Beat) You going to find him then? The Mole? 
 I'm going to try. How long have you been here? 
 Few days. Needed somewhere to hide. 
 I wouldn't use my home as a safe house. There's every chance they're watching it. 45. 
 Calculated risk Mister Smiley. I wanted to see you, figured you'd turn up here sooner or later. 
 What do you want Ricki? 
 There's a woman. I want you to trade for her. Get her back from Karla. 
 What woman? 
 Her name's Irina. 
 (O.S.) I met her in Istanbul. They'd found some Russian trade delegate, name of Boris. He was spending high and wide in the nightclubs and some idiot thought we could turn him. 
. 
 (V.O.) I took one look and saw that he was a hood, Moscow trained. 
'S P.O.V. 
'S P.O.V. 
 (grinning) This is going to be a long night. 48. 
 You baby-sit this one. 
 Your bloke's a bit of a bastard. (Beat) Just wanted to check you were alright. 
 You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London? 
 Nothing. Didn't have anything to tell yet. But... I could sense it in her. 
 Sense what? 
 A secret. 
 (V.O.) I played the businessman, Michael Trench. A Holiday Romance. Thought I'd take my time with it... 
 I know what you are. 
 IRINA (CONT'D) I would like to talk to your boss Control. I have something to trade. Something big. I want a new life in the West. 
 IRINA (CONT'D) That is the deal. You tell them. 
 What made you so sure she wasn't coat-trailing? 
 We've all got our strengths. And weaknesses. 
 She had children in Russia? 
 That's why they let her and Boris out. So, I said I'd tell the Circus. 
 (Beat) But you didn't? 
 (V.O.) Wanted to find out more first. So, I waited her out. 
 If I tell you, I'm putting my life in your hands. The lives of my children? Do you understand? 
 (tenderly) Promise me you'll be careful. No details to the Circus. Not until we're safe. 
 (genuine) I promise. 
 You were supposed to have gone. London stations's been on to me. They want to know what the hell you're doing. 52. 
 (without turning) Fuck off. 
 And what did your message say, Ricki? 
 Just that I had a Moscow Centre trained hood wanting to defect. 
 What else? 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) I understand how you felt. You wanted to do something. 
 I know what I am to the Circus. One of the scalp-hunters. Someone to give the dirty jobs to. I wanted to bring this one in myself. 
 Yes. I quite see that. 
 I said that she claimed to have information crucial to the well- being of the Circus. 
 (O.S) And what else? 
 That she had information concerning a Double Agent. 
 What happened next Ricki? 
 I waited for a reply. 
 (V.O.) I waited hours but that was all they sent. It didn't make sense. Like they were stalling. 
. 54. 
 
 They put her on a ship. That's all I know. I've done a lot of things Mister Smiley, but... I don't know why... I keep thinking about her. (Beat) 
 Where are you going Ricki? You said yourself, Karla will be looking for you. I can take you somewhere. Keep you safe. 
 Who's going to keep you safe? 
 Percy has always resisted suggestions of wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence. 
 Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon. 
 I've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies, so far, Minister. 
 Greedy boy. 
 My goal has been to establish his track record beyond all doubt. I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in- arms. 
 You think they'll take us back into bed? 
 I'm not interested in a one-off trade. I want on-going access to American intelligence. 
 Do you think we can get it? 
 With Witchcraft on our side, I think we can get anything we bloody-well want. 
 (O.S.) (mock out-rage) Percy? 
 Percy. Did you do this? 
 CONTROL (CONT'D) You penny pinching Scot. Can you not take a bloody order. No one is to tamper with the recipe. It's going to take us five hours to get drunk on this piss water. 
 I followed the recipe. 
 Smiley? Where's Ann? Get me a lady of taste? Ann will sort it out. 
 (grateful to get away from the deb) I'll go find her. 
 
 You look tired. 
 Yes. I didn't sleep well. (Beat) I want you to get something for me, Peter. I need the duty officer's log book for last November. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to send you up a floor, into the Lion's den. (Beat) If you have the slightest reservation... 
 Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation? 
 If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me. I'm sorry, but you're alone. 
 You're clean. Nothing on your back. Nothing on your conscience. 
 Mister Guillam? How's the family? 60. 
 Fine, Bryant. Up to Registry today. 
 Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag sir. 
 Time you oiled this thing, isn't it? 
 (O.S.) We keep asking... 
 You're kidding? 
 New rules. 
 Mind the jewels. 
 Pen and watch sir. 
 (O.S.) What the hell are you doing up here? 
 You don't look pleased to see me, Bill? 
 Why would I be? You bloody pariah. 
 Doing some research. Makes a change from sitting on my arse. 
 Heard it was quiet down there. 
 As the grave. When're you going to give us something to do? 
 Haven't you heard? Technology's the future. No need for you apes anymore. I can get you a posting to Northern Ireland if that helps get the blood racing. 
 Thanks anyway. Stick to sitting on my arse. 
 (re: Guillam's bag) Want me to look after that for you, Mister Guillam? 
 Thanks... 62. 
 Gotta give you a chit. The Dolphin'll kill me if I don't. New Rules. 
 So, chit me. 
 What you up to this weekend? 
 (rakish) Visiting aunts. 
 I'll bet. 
 SAL (CONT'D) Corridor D. 
 SAL (CONT'D) The two-eights are halfway on your right, the three-ones are next alcove down. 
 (To Guillam) Telephone sir. 
 (as though distracted) Oh to hell, who is it? 
 Outside line, sir. Someone rough. The garage, I think, regarding your car. 
 (into the phone) Hello? (Beat) Well, damn. Can't you do the bloody repair? 
 Can't be done sir, you're going to need a new gear box. 64. 
 At least get on to the main dealers first... 
 (O.S.) Have you got the number? 
 Well, hold on... 
 Could we see you Peter? 
 Of course. 
 Will do sir. 
 (O.S.) (shouting from the other room) Esterhase, I'll have no phone calls, tell them... 
 The Chief will take no calls, please, ladies... 
 (Muttering) We can hear. 
 We are having a conference. 66. 
 (Reading) Well now young Peter Guillam, are you ready for me finally? 
 Couple of Arab ploys look quite promising. Other than that, getting quite good at ping-pong. 
 Arabs... You can rent one but you can't buy one. Right Bill? 
 (Not missing a beat) Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon. 
 I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr. 
 I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled. 
 (Quietly) What's that shrug for? 
 But I haven't been seeing him! So get your facts straight and get OFF MY BACK! 
 So if I told you that Tarr had recently arrived in Paris would you be surprised? 
 Nothing would surprise me about Tarr. 
 And if I told you we happen to know that thirty thousand pounds mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month, would that surprise you? 
 What for? 
 Never mind what for! To muddy the water, that's what for! Spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails! The point is this - he's heading for home. The first peep from him you come to the grown-ups, understood? Anyone you see at this table. But not another damn soul! 68. 
 (German, subtitled) He's waiting for you. 
 (A faint smile) All go smoothly did it? (Beat) Where we off to? 
 The hotel. I have to see George. 
 Mister Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir. Change of venue. 
 (O.S.) George? 69. 
 Hello, Mister Guillam, sorry I took so long to come back. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 Ricki's been helping us Peter. (Indicating TAPE DECK) He's been telling us all about his adventures. 
 (To Smiley) He's a double, George! There is no Mole! The whole thing's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow. Karla's bought him for thirty thousand pounds! 
 As you did take the trouble to steal it... 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Ricki, you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information? 
 (Sullenly) S'right. 
 What was the date? 
 He doesn't know because there was no telegram! The whole thing... 
 November 20th. It would have been November 20th. Evening. 
 November 20th is missing. (Beat) Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence? 
 What about the money? 
 Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him. 
 (Reading) "Enquiries to the fifth floor." 
 You recognize that handwriting? (Beat) That's Toby Esterhase. 71. 
 Why didn't you tell me? That you had Tarr? 
 Secrecy is a habit. 
 I should get some rest. And I suppose you should get your reading done. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What for? 
 I wanted to believe Tarr was lying. (Beat) All this time, thinking I'm fighting a war. It's a sham. Karla won years ago and we didn't even know it. 
 (Beat) I met him once. Karla. (MORE) 72. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) In fifty-five. Moscow Centre was in pieces. Purge after purge. Half their Agents were jumping ship and I travelled around signing them up. Hundreds of them. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) One of them was calling himself Gerstmann. He was on his way back to Russia, and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed. Plane had a twenty-four lay over at Delhi, and that's how long I had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Little room...I'm sitting here...he's sitting there... 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) The Americans have had him tortured. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) No fingernails. It's incredibly hot. I'm very tired and all I want to do is get this over with and get back home. Things weren't going well with Ann. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) I give him the usual pitch... Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life. After questioning. Or you can catch your plane and fly home and be shot, like Bykov, Shur, Muranov... 
 (Beat) What did he say? 
 (To the chair) Think of your wife. You have a wife, don't you? I brought you some cigarettes, by the way. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Use my lighter. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) "We could arrange for her to join you, we have a lot of stock to trade. If you go back, she'll be ostracised. Think of her. Think about how much she..." 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Kept harping on about the damn wife! Telling him more about me, than... Should have walked out, of course, but for some reason... it seemed important to save this one. (Beat) So I go on. "Know you're a chain-smoker, help yourself," "We're not so very different you and I.." 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) (To the chair) Look, we've both spent our lives looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems. Don't you think it's time to recognise there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine? 74. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Never said a word. Not one word. Next morning he got back on his plane, gave the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched - this was a chain-smoker, mind - and flew off to what he presumed would be his death. He kept my lighter. It was a gift - "To George, from Ann. All my love." 
 That was Karla? And he flew back to die rather than give in? 
 Yes. (Beat) And that's how I know he can be beaten. Because he's a fanatic. And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt. 
 What did he look like? 
 That's the thing. (Beat) I can't remember. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) After today, Peter you have to assume they're watching you. If there's anything you need tidied up... now's the time. 
 (without looking up) Nearly done. 
 RICHARD (CONT'D) (to himself) For Godsakes... I think they're all sharing the same moronic brain. 
 RICHARD (CONT'D) (With dignity) If there's someone else, you can tell me. I'm a grown-up. 
 (Braking) Time sir? 
 (Quietly) Got your specs on Jumbo? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Who's the fellow down there? 
 (Disappointed) Don't know sir. 
 Who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why doesn't he look this way? (MORE) 76. 
 PRIDEAUX (CONT'D) Wouldn't you look if you saw a bunch of boys flogging a car around a field? Doesn't he like boys? Anyone sees him again, let me know. Don't hold with odd bods hanging about. Might steal the Alvis, which is...? 
 (By rote) Best car in England! 
 Stop it! Stop it! 
 Keep your bloody hands off her! 
 Christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt! 
 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Haven't seen many of the boys and girls for a while, matter of fact. 
 But that's the way it is, George, isn't it? When you're out, you're out. Too much of this stuff. 
 (Obliging) How. (Beat) I need to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was killed, Jerry. You were duty officer, weren't you? 
 Yes. Control asked me to man the phones that night. Said someone was doing a special job for the service. He wanted someone from outside he could trust. If anything came in, I was to tell him and only him. 
 (Entering) Been a bit of a panic, sir. 
 Ann? I'm sorry to bother you. Is George back yet? 79. 
 You rang my house? 
 Just on the off chance you were back from Berlin. 
 What did you say? 
 Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis. She said you weren't back yet. That was it. 
 Go on. 
 All hell broke loose - military yelling about Hungarian tank movements on the border, Lacon and the Minister baying at the door. Thank Christ Bill Haydon turned up when he did. 
 Get out. 
 I tried to get hold of you... 
 I just picked up half a story on the ticker-tape at my club... Tell me. 
 Jim Prideaux's been shot. 80. 
 Get me the Hungarian Embassy. 
 (With relief) Yes sir... 
 You go and tell your Masters what will happen if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged... 
 Any more news on him? 
 We need to go to his flat. Clear out anything linked. 
 Haydon heard the news at his club? 
 The Saville. 
 At one-thirty? The ticker-tape wouldn't be running. 
 Peter... 
 Jesus Christ. Haydon? How could he have known? 
 It's not him, Peter. 
 Then how did he know? 
 (gently) Because he was at my house that night. With Ann. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) (of the Hamburger) I quite like this. 
 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hello? (beat) Oh hello Jerry. No I'm afraid George isn't back yet. 
 Just in case it's of interest, dear. We are observed. Old Filth in the bushes. Not very subtle but there you are... 83. 
 (O.S.) Good flight? 
 Yes. Pleasant enough. 
 I was just passing, thought I'd call in. Ann was in bed but she insisted on getting up. She said she'll be down in a minute. 
 (O.S.) Awful daub really but Ann expressed a liking... What's keeping her? 
 (O.S.) Sir? 
 Come in, Roach. 
 Sir there's a stranger parked down on the road. He's just sitting there. 
 (Gently) It's alright, old fella. Don't cry. Nobody ever watched like you, did they? Off you go, now. 
 Are you going to have to leave? 
 I'll be fine. You get back to bed. 
 You weren't followed? 
 CONTROL (CONT'D) Trust no-one, Jim. Especially not in the main stream. What Hungarian identities do you still have running? 
 Andras Benedek, Hungarian journalist based in Paris. 
 If you're caught, you keep me out of it. You were acting alone, bit of Private Enterprise. Understood? 
 CONTROL (CONT'D) I've had an offer of service. A Hungarian General. Wants to come over. I want you to meet him. He has information I need, Jim. 
 What information? 
 Rocketry. Ballistics. Bit of politics. 
 What else? 
 (Beat) Treasure. He has treasure. The name of the Mole Moscow Centre has planted at the top of the Circus. 
 CONTROL (CONT'D) There's a rotten apple Jim and we have to find it. 
 CONTROL (CONT'D) I'm   so close I can almost feel his   heart beating. I know it's one   of five men. All I want from you   is one word. 
 CONTROL (CONT'D) Alleline - Tinker. (Points at the next photo) Haydon - Tailor. Bland - Soldier. We drop Sailor, it's too close to Tailor. (Pointing at next photo) Esterhase - Poorman. 
 Which means I was...? 
 You were Beggarman. 
 What did you make of it, Jim? Control's theory? 
 (Stiff) I thought it was madness. To think any one of you could have been a traitor... madness. 
 But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why? 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Perhaps some part of you wanted to know if Control was right? Wanted to know if there was a Mole, who it might be? 
 (Hard) I went because Control asked me to go. It's called doing one's duty. 
'S P.O.V. 
 (V.O.) What did you tell them? 
 (V.O.) Everything. 
 I held on as long as I could, to give everyone else time to get the hell out of there. (Beat) Did they? 
 PRIDEAUX (CONT'D) My networks in Hungary. Did they get out? 
 (Beat) No. They were blown. The story is you blew them to save your own skin. 90. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) What was your last line of defence? 
 The Mole. Control's crazy theory. I was going to bury that so deep, they'd never get it out of me. Which was a joke. 
 Why? 
 Because they already knew. They wanted to know how far Control had got in his investigation. 
 What else? 
 Circus gossip. Was Percy's wife still drinking, who was Bland screwing in the office. That sort of thing. 
 Did they ask about me at all? 
 One of them did. 
 What did he say about me? 
 He had a cigarette lighter. Kept flashing it round for me to see. Showed me the inscription. "To George, from Ann. All my love." He reckoned after Bill's fling with her, she might want to change the inscription. 
 PRIDEAUX (CONT'D) (Still looking to the side) I told him to go to hell. (MORE) 91. 
 PRIDEAUX (CONT'D) If they had one man like Bill Haydon they could call it set and match! 
 (Beat, quietly) That was well said. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Try and put it all behind you, Jim. 
 He gave me a cigarette. 
 Jim? 
 I thought it was my last one. 
 MAN'S VOICE (Russian accent) Do you know this woman? 
 I don't know her. 
 I... 
 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Tell Percy Alleline what we did. 
 P.O.V. - 
 (V.O.) Do you know who she was? 
 (V.O.) (Cold) Nobody you need concern yourself with. An unfortunate... 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) He said when he got out, when he was being debriefed at the Nursery, he had a visitor. 
 Who? 
 Toby Esterhase. 93. 
 He gave him a thousand pounds. Told him he was dead now and couldn't come back. Had to become a Lotus Eater - forget everything that happened - Control's theory, Tinker, Tailor... all of it. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Yes, that's what I thought. How on earth did Esterhase hear about "Tinker, Tailor?" 
 You alright? 
 Will you watch my back, Peter? Look out for a solo. Just a feeling I've had. 
 Yes, George. I'll watch. 
 (O.S.) (Over headphones) What exactly did Irina say? 94. 
 (Over headphones) She said there was a General, work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London. And that Polyakov's real job was to service the mole. He meets him regularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla. 
 This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear? 
 Perfectly, Minister. (Beat) There is a house, somewhere in this city, where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative. I need the address of that house. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 (Calmly) It's Lacon's advice I'm following. (To Lacon) You told me to follow in Control's footsteps. 95. 
 (Snapping) Well, I wouldn't consider that sound advice, after the bloody mess Control left us with. It's taken Alleline - and, if I may say so, myself - this long to get us back into the race. 
 I'm glad you take some of the credit. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov. You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you. His real role is to receive information from the Mole to take back to Karla. 
 That's... that's not possible. 
 Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that. 
 (Appalled) Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine! It's been gold! 
 Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in. 
 Oh God... We can't be made to look like fucking fools again! Forget Europe, if we have the black men getting to hear about this on Walla-Wallah News! What if we find the Mole and we move him sideways, some department where he can't do any harm? Is the Kremlin likely to boast about this? 
 Not in their interests sir. They need the Enemy to look like a threat... 
 Well, tell them to play the game. We don't go crowing about their fuck-ups! 
 (Suddenly) We are not the prize. We're the bait. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) You've opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans. What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin. Witchcraft's information, the "gold" Karla let you have? It wasn't to lure you. It was to lure the Americans. Now, do you want to take credit for that? 
 What can we do? 
 We have one thing the Mole wants. 
 If I go... 
 You'll go... 
 ... I want your word you'll get Irina back. Don't care who you have to trade. I want a family. Don't wanna end up like you lot... 
 (Beat) I'll do my utmost, Ricki. 
. 
'S P.O.V. 
 (O.S.) Keep walking please. 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) I want to talk about loyalty Toby. Control recruited you when you were trying to escape from Hungary didn't he? A wanted man. Saved you from a KGB bullet, didn't he? And yet, when the time came, when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline, you didn't hesitate? Understandable perhaps, with your war experience. You've survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides, serve any Master? 
 What... what's this about George? 
 It's about which Master you've been serving, Toby. 
 Intelligence has been leaked, Toby. Someone's been taking files from the Circus... 99. 
 This is a mistake George, this is all... 
 The files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they? 
 Yes. And yes, I delivered them. 
 (V.O.) ... but so did Percy... 
 ... and Bill... 
 And Roy... 100. 
 Things aren't always what they seem. You know that George. Moscow thinks Polyakov's working for them, so, every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them, just chicken-feed, keep his bosses happy. But Polyakov's our Joe, part of a big operation... 
 Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I know. 
 Why are we here? Why are we...? 
 Who gave you the message for Jim to forget about Tinker Tailor? 
 Bland! 
 To get rid of Connie Sachs? Westerby? 
 Bland or Haydon. I don't remember. One of them. Maybe Percy. I don't know who. 
 You're just the messenger? Running between them all. Anything to serve Witchcraft? 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) I know all about your secret source. And I know something you don't. I know who he is.(Beat) He's Karla. 
 (V.O.) One of you has been giving Polyakov the Crown Jewels. 
 I didn't know. I swear I... 
 Are you still a wanted man, Toby? 
 George...! 
 You picked the wrong side, Toby. 
 (crying) George, you've got to believe me. I would never... I'm loyal, George. I'm loyal! 
 Give me the address. Where do you meet Polyakov? 
 What are the safety signals? 
 There's an air duct. Open and all's well. Closed and you're not to enter. 
 Where is the mike, Mrs McCraig? 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) And what's the procedure? 
 Whenever the gentlemen are meeting I record the session. The tapes are sent back to the Circus. 
 If you're at all worried you can call Lacon from the basement phone. Let's try the tape recorder shall we? 
 (O.S.) The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled. The flame that lit the battles wreck, shone round him o'er the dead... 
 (In French) Guest from London Station, Monsieur Fourcade. 
 (as they walk on) The whole service is looking for you, Ricki. They'll skin you alive if they find you. 104. 
 (mildly) Maybe I want them to find me. 
 You can go home now, Ben. Leave the books where they are and put the keys into the machines. I'll be talking to London presently under my own steam. 
 Okay boss. 
 (Flat) Ben stays here. 
 (dictating) Ricki Tarr claims to have further information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus. 
. 
 (into phone) Tinker... 
 (into phone) How's he look? 
 (O.S.) Busy. 
 (O.S.) Tailor... 
 MENDEL (O.S.) (CONT'D) Here comes Soldier... 
 (O.S.) Full house. 
 Read it aloud. 
 Personal for Tarr from Alleline... 
 (V.O.) ... require clarification before meeting your request... 
 (O.S.) ... Quote information vital to safeguarding of the Circus unquote does not qualify... 
 ... send further information. 
 That's the way Percy boy! You keep stalling. I better warn you Ben, there's some lousy people in this outfit. Don't trust a fucking one of them. 
'S P.O.V. 
 (O.S.) Mister Smiley... 
 I'm here, Mendel. 
 (O.S.) One's gone. 
 (O.S.) (In Russian) What is your cover story in case we are disturbed? 
 (O.S.) (on tape, in Russian) This can be salvaged. Tarr can be found and liquidated. 
 He's here. 
 I won't have bloodshed. I want absolute calm! 
'S P.O.V. 
. 
 
 I was assured there would be no coercion. 
 It's almost funny George. I know the Inquisitors little bag of tricks. I taught most of them. Don't mind the tears. Just a reaction. An over-reaction, if you like. Craddox says I'll be off in a few days. I keep thinking how I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow. 
 If I can. 
 There's a girl...Would you give her some money for me? Give her a good cover story. If it helps tell her I love her. It's all here. 
 Of course. 
 There's a boy too. Bung him a few quid to shut him up. Take it out of the reptile fund. 
 I did have one or two questions. About Prideaux. 
 Damn it! I got him back, didn't I? 
 Yes, yes you did. That was good of you. (Beat) I'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you? 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on his Hungarian mission? 
 Yes, as a matter of fact he did. 111. 
 To say what? 
 SMILEY (CONT'D) (almost to himself) To warn you. Because he knew, deep down, it was you all along. 
 So did you. 
 Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus? 
 I'm not his bloody office boy. 
 What are you then? 
 I'm someone who made his mark. 
 (Quietly) Is there anything you want me to pass on to Ann? 
 Oh, that was nothing personal, George, I hope you understand that? Karla said you were good, the one we had to worry about. But you do have a blind spot. (MORE) 112. 
 Up to a point. 
 (Quietly) "Tailor." 
'S P.O.V. 
 (Of the runners) Just like us Jim. (Beat) Best days. 114. 
 I made you something. 
 I don't want you hanging around here. Keep away from me from now on. Go and join the others. 
 PRIDEAUX (CONT'D) Just bloody join in. Go and play damn you.

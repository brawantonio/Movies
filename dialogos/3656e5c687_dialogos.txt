 "FATAL INSTINCT" 
 
 ANGLE - ARCH 
 (interrupts) Jeez... knock off the chatter, will ya. 
 I'm awake! Where do you come up with all that crap about women? 
 Are you kiddin'? 
 Aayyhh... women are trouble... 
 Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff, pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a beautiful wife waitin' for ya at home. Everything a guy could ever want, including NO kids. 
 What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break! (looks around) Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes you think Milo's gonna show up here? 
 And how we s'posed to recognize this scumbag? 
 These are the best damn Nachos in North America. Maybe the world! 
 I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill. You want some? 
 Got a light? 
 How about a match? 
 You really are incredibly stupid, aren't you? I like that in a man. 
 You sound so sure of yourself. 
 Let me buy you a drink, Mr. uh... 
 Thirsty. What about that drink? 
 Brain surgeon? 
 Oooo... and I bet you have a big gun. 
 If I can't buy you a drink... (nods toward vendor) ...let me buy you one of those. 
 Not me. 
 Two dogs. Hot. 
 Only when I'm in heat. 
 Where ya going? 
 That's okay. You're doing just fine. 
 Look out! He's got a weenie! 
 
 I skipped high school, cop! 
 What about it? 
 Yeah. So? 
 Ha! That's just theoretical hypothesis. Inverse proportionate explosive dynamics has never been demonstrated conclusively in a laboratory environment. 
 
 Nahhhh! 
 
 (O.S.) Oh yes, Frank! Adjust the stroke by ten percent! That's it. (CLUNK! A wrench) Now tweak my points. Oh yes, oh yes! (THUNK! Pliers) You got it! Stabilize your ball joints and grind my rear differential! (CLINK! Screwdriver) Now accelerate! Floor it! Lay rubber, baby! VRRROOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM! 
 Not bad for an auto mechanic... 
 (grins, cocky) Yeah, well you're not so bad yourself... for a lawyer's wife... 
 Better watch your tongue, sweetie, or I'll have my husband arrest you. 
 Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When does he ever find time for you? 
 He doesn't. That's why I need you to keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why drive a jalopy when you can have a hot rod? 
 Maybe you should trade him in on a new model. 
 I would... if I could make any money on the deal. 
 (reaches for her) Want to go for another test drive? 
 Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm still under warranty. 
 Uh huh. Want some coffee? 
 Frank here was just grabbing a little before going back to work on my car. 
 (shrugs) Oh... I don't know... six, seven weeks. 
 (a leering smile) Think I got my finger on it though. 
 (breathless) Ned... don't you have to be somewhere? 
 Who's that? 
 Just the postman. He always rings twice. 
 
 (hands him file) Right here. The judge decided to skip arraignment and take Milo direct to trial. You're six minutes late, but don't sweat it. You got Judge Allen. He's always eleven minutes late. 
 I suggest you try Lemming versus Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped in the water and everybody followed. 
 Really? 
 Two years, seven months, twenty-three days, nineteen hours... (checks her watch) ...six minutes and fifty-two seconds. (softly, to herself) ...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty- five... fifty-six... 
 Never. But that's okay. I don't need a raise. In fact... I was thinking of giving you a rebate on my salary. 
 LAURA'S HUSBAND Did we forget something? 
 LAURA'S HUSBAND Did we forget something? 
 (coming out of it) I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a bit... claustrophobic... in the bathroom. 
 Wear the blue one. 
 I can't. 
 Mr. Crumley... you cannot chew gum in my courtroom... unless you have enough for everyone. 
 Bailiff. Pass these out. 
 And don't forget the jury. 
 (interrupting) Mr. Ravine... please approach the bench. 
 You're not running for congress here, so knock off the speeches and quit inciting these brainless morons! Now pick up the pace and wrap this son- of-a-bitch up! Call your first witness. 
 Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? 
 Mr. Ravine... 
 I'm dismissing this case on the grounds of improper grammar. 
 (jumps up) But your Honor...! 
 I know, I know. It's a technicality. But it's the kind of technicality that makes the American legal system what it is today! Court's adjourned! 
 I waited. You never came back. 
 Thanks... 
 It's miraculous what a real woman can do... with a bobbie pin. 
 (offering) Cigarette? 
 Yes, I know. I like things that are bad for me. (touching lawbooks) So... I hear you go both ways. 
 No, I mean... you're a cop and a lawyer. 
 I'll get that. 
 Lola Cain. 
 (sarcastic) So lovely to meet you, Laura. 
 It's getting late. I'll give you a ride home, Ned. 
 I'll tow you. 
 I should call someone to fix this... 
 I'll call from home. 
 I think I should warn you, Mr. Ravine... I'm not wearing any underwear. 
 I've run across some... papers... and I thought you might be able to tell me what they are. You see, I'm not very experienced when it comes to... papers. 
 No... they're at home. I thought you might stop by... 
 Don't they ever give you a night off? 
 (picks up cigarette) Why don't we meet tomorrow evening then? 
 I'll let you know where. 
 Nothing a good interior decorator couldn't fix. 
 Take care of this for me, will ya? 
 I came back for my shower cap. 
 Yeah, well you came to the right place. 
 Sit down. 
 Where is he? 
 On duty all night. By the time he wraps up his reports, it'll be close to noon tomorrow. 
 I was just reading over... 
 Take off the hat, Frank. 
 I was just reading over my husband's insurance policies. You wouldn't know anything about insurance, would you, Frankie? 
 Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies part-time. I got half a brain... or didn't you notice? 
 I musta had my eye on something else. (hands him papers) How about a translation. 
 Standard accident policy... all the usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three million bucks! (flips page) And there's a triple indemnity rider. 
 Meaning? 
 Aw, it's just something agents throw in so we can boost the premium. If the policy holder dies under very specific conditions, it pays off three times the face value of the policy. 
 Nine million dollars...? 
 Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the company. Nobody ever collects. 
 Why not? 
 Well, like here... it only pays off if he's shot with a pistol, falls from a moving northbound train and drowns in a fresh water stream. 
 All three? 
 See what I mean, sweetheart? What are the odds of that? 
 It could happen. (dramatic beat) Suppose it did happen? 
 Then you'd be rich. 
 Then we'd be rich. 
 What're you sayin'...? 
 We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch! And I know exactly how! He has a legal symposium in Santa Barbara this weekend... All we have to do is get him to take the train up instead of driving. 
 How we gonna do that? Didn't you tell me he hates trains? 
 That's where you come in, baby. You're gonna rig his car so it doesn't work. That should be no problem for you. 
 Then... we give him a lift to the train station... through Dealey Plaza, past the Book Suppository and around the grassy knoll... 
 Isn't that out of our way? 
 Move, Frank. 
 And pay attention. 
 Ten minutes out of the station he'll be standing in the vestibule between cars... trying to avoid a panic attack. Fourteen minutes and ten seconds out, the train crosses the Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen minutes and fifty-four seconds, I shoot him, shove him out the door... he hits the river and drowns. Bingo! A triple play. We're rich! 
 You been thinking about this a lot, haven't you? 
 No. It just came to me. (closer, seductive) I had this image of a big, powerful, throbbing train... plunging into a long, dark, wet tunnel. 
 #1 Hey, man, we got rights! Don't you be layin' no deleterious malfeasance on us. 
 Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy. You seem a little tense tonight. What is it? 
 #1 You should try to be more sensitive, man. More romantic. Bring her flowers. 
 #1 Try to understand how she feels. After all... 
 #1 She may be weary... Women do get weary... Wearing that same old shabby dress... But when she's weary... Try a little ten-der-ness... 
 What's to be afraid! It's like making breakfast! You bring home the bacon... she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got an omelette in the oven! (a beat, then) Why don't you knock off early... go home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake up in the morning and find you there for a change. 
 Don't worry about that. 
 #1 We'll do our own paperwork, man! 
 (on television) ...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of female! Smokes three cigars a day, drinks a straight shot of vodka at bedtime... and still has sex! 
 My God, Ned... you look like you were hit by a bus. 
 Max Shady's mother. 
 MRS. SHADY Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max, is getting out of prison tomorrow. 
 MRS. SHADY Seven long, miserable years in the slammer. And he's a bit pissed off. 
 MRS. SHADY I'm very concerned about him, Mr. Ravine. He said you were a two-bit shyster... and he's going to rip your head off and use it for a bowling ball! 
 MRS. SHADY (ever hopeful) You think? 
 MRS. SHADY Oh yes... live autopsies... 
 MRS. SHADY Maybe so... but he said he's going to punch you in the testicles... 
 MRS. SHADY ...smash your face... 
 MRS. SHADY ...and decimate your wardrobe. 
 MRS. SHADY And I wouldn't want that to happen. (spanks his butt) He's a naughty naughty boy. I just thought I should warn you. 
 MRS. SHADY (to Laura) Bye for now. (pauses by desk) Oh... may I have a cookie? 
 (at file cabinet) Sure. 
 MRS. SHADY Thank yooooooooou. 
 Oh my God, Ned. 
 Don't you realize, Ned?... you could be in real danger. 
 Extreme peril. You know, the risk of personal bodily harm. 
 Your insurance file. But the policy's missing. Did you take it home? 
 Oh, wait a second... 
 A 
 LAURA'S HUSBAND Lau-raaaaa! 
! 
 
 Yes... I know. It's okay. I'm just a little... pre-menstrual. 
 That Lola Cain... "person"... stopped by. She left this! 
 Thanks... 
 Is it? I never know. My body heat runs about twenty degrees above normal. 
 I doubt we'll find one. Even the wind chimes on my porch aren't moving much these days. They keep thudding softly, like dairy cows bumping butts in the night. I go out there expecting to find a cool breeze... but it's just a lot of hot air. 
 A lot of them have tried that seat. You're the first one's lasted this long. 
 Don't. It's broken. 
 No. I thought you might come over... 
 I brought my own car. 
 I know it sounds silly, but would you leave first... wait in your car? I come here a lot and I wouldn't want those men to think I'm "easy"... a slut who'll jump into bed with anyone at the drop of a hat. But if you leave first... 
 (for all to hear) Now leave me alone! 
 I have The Clapper. 
 My wind chimes. 
 Well well... I guess you have been around. I'm impressed. 
 (remembering) Papers. Right. 
 Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can you tell me what they are? 
 No. You keep them... as a memento of our time together. 
 I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay you for all you've done? 
 Isn't there some other way? 
 No, I mean, isn't there something else you want? Something I could give you? 
 How fast was I going, officer? 
 Suppose you pull me over and frisk me? 
 Suppose I find a cop with a bigger nightstick? 
 Suppose you handcuff me to the bed? 
 You're not so tough. Last chance. 
 What's the matter? Don't you want me? It's the way I look, isn't it? 
 I knew you'd come back... 
 That's not what you came back for. 
 ANGLE - FIREPLACE 
 
 (breathless) ...don't... stop... 
 ...Oh Ned... please... don't... stop... 
 That takes care of foreplay. 
 It's time, Max. 
 
 #1 Mr. Shady! What's the first thing you're gonna do now that you're out? 
 Find Ned Ravine... rip his head off and use it for a bowling ball! 
 #2 Are you a good bowler? 
 #3 You ever bowled a three-hundred game? 
 #4 How would you handle a seven-ten split? 
 #1 Say, aren't you wearing one of Ravine's "trademark" blue suits? 
 Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a gift... to make up for losing my case. Now I'm going to wear it to his friggin' funeral!! 
 Ma! 
 Iron Butterfly. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. 
 It tells the sad story of a woman who is rejected by her lover after a brief, but torrid, affair... so she stalks him with an ice pick and stabs him with it more than a thousand times. 
 Yes... it was. I should check on my homeowners insurance. 
 What are you saying, Ned? That you're rejecting me, your lover, after a brief, but torrid, affair?! 
 Don't touch anything. You bond with it... you buy it. Whatdya want? 
 Yeah. For what purpose? 
 Right. They all say that. 
 Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know you're not the kind of guy who punches out parakeets? Or takes some poor defenseless animal, throws it in a sack and runs over it with your car five or six times. 
 Boy, I would. They're driving me 
! 
 Shuddup! 
 Okay... tell me more about this broad you're married to. I like to match people with the pets they deserve. 
 Uh-uh. 
 And a damn good job, too. One of 'em even did it in Spanish. 
 Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours. 
 (O.S.) (on T.V.) ...I'd like to reach down Ned Ravine's throat and pull out his guts with my bare hands! 
 (shocked) Jesus... you hear that? 
 Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The guy's a friggin' looney! 
 (on T.V.) I'd like to mash his head like a ripe melon... 
 (on T.V.) ...then cut off all his fingers and rip out his liver with my teeth! 
 Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit. 
 I want to see you, Ned. 
 How come we gotta meet here? 
 We have to be careful now. We can't risk being seen together at the house or someone might connect us to the murder later on. 
 Here... put this on. 
 (whispers to Frank) Speak Yiddish. 
 What? 
 Red Yiddish. 
 Ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der nisht geshtoigen un nisht gefloygen. (I been thinkin'... maybe this plan is too complicated.) 
 Zein nisht azoy meshige! Der plan iz kosher vi yosher. (Quit worrying. The plan is perfect.) 
 Yo! Ober mir darfen imvarfen in tsug. Un schissen un schtippen in vasser arein. Oy a broch! Mir zenen git bakackt. (Yeah, but we gotta get him on the train, shoot him... then push him in the river. There's a million ways we can screw up.) 
 Vus iz mit idr? Die host a vaichen schmoke? (You're not going soft on me, are you?) 
 Ven hob ich gehat a vaichen schmoke? (When have I ever gone soft on you?) 
 Lest'n Yomkippur. (Last Yom Kippur.) 
 Nu shoin, ein mul. Es paseert tsie yeyden man. (Okay... once! It happens to every guy.) 
 Oy! Mir vellen zein oif groise tsures. Me'vet unz chap'n. (We're going to be in big trouble. They're going to catch us.) 
 There's very little risk involved. Statistics reveal that less than thirty-two percent of all murderers are ever apprehended. 
 You speak Yiddish? 
 No. But I can read sub-titles. 
 Oh gee, you shouldn't have... 
 She called. Wondered why you never came home last night. I told her you were working with a client, undercover. 
 Were you? 
 There's lipstick on your collar. 
 No... there isn't. But you answered my question. She's a real looker, huh? 
 Lola Cain. 
 Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't noticed. (returns to work) That's alright. She noticed enough for both of us. 
 I worry about you, Ned. I worry a lot. (hands him papers) Max Shady's been faxing death threats to you all morning. 
 Did you get to the one...? 
 Yeah... that one. 
 (whispers) Wait. It might be him. 
 (as if obvious) From my purse. 
 (still obvious) Handing it to you. 
 You shoot it. A bullet comes out. Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a cop, I'd think you'd know these things. 
 (checks card) Flowers for Ned Rav... (looks up) Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy? Man, you are dead meat! 
 Is this another sick joke from Max Shady? 
 (hands it to him) Lola Cain. 
 I'll put these in water for you. 
 LOLA'S VOICE Ned, darling... I know this seems like a strange way to talk with you... but since you won't take my calls, I have no other choice. (then suddenly) Watch it! That red car's turning left! 
 LOLA'S VOICE I love you, Ned. We're meant to be together... forever. (then suddenly) The light's changing! Floor it! Go! Go! Go! 
 LOLA'S VOICE Nice move! (then sincere again) Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not even your wife. I'd hate to have to tell her about us, but if necessary... I will. 
 What happened to you last night? 
 (sarcastic) You could have called. But then, I suppose you were tied up. 
 I never know when you're coming home, Ned. How can I ever make any plans? 
 So what's in the box? 
 What is it? 
 Not enough like a cat. 
 How about... Ned? 
 No kidding. 
 At least. 
 Hello?... Hello?... Hello? (then, whispering) Frank? Is that you? 
 (filtered) I told you not to call. Frank? FRANK! 
 Who's Frank? 
 I had to see you, Ned. I need to feel your arms around me! I wanna suck your toes til the nails pop off! 
 It doesn't matter. She'll know all about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE! 
 I got us tickets to see Iron Butterfly! 
 Why are you running from me? Didn't it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing my buns with carnuba wax? (looks down) Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey want to go exploring? 
 I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey for setting yet another unusual legal precedent. This is the first time I've ever tried a case in which the JURY was found to be insane. 
 (to another Juror) What're you? A thirty-eight long? 
 The jury will be remanded to the Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi Valley. Court's adjourned. 
 It's not important. I just had one last year. 
 Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll have another one sometime. 
 You're so sweet. You don't have to. You gave me a present last year. Those lovely Ginzu knives. 
 (V.O.) What's he thinking when he looks at me with that goofy smile...? 
 (V.O.) If I told him how I really feel, he'd probably fire me. What am I saying? He probably doesn't even know I exist. 
 (V.O.) I guess I'll just have to wait. But he's married. I could wait forever. Than again... maybe Lana will get hit by a runaway truck. There's always a chance that... 
 (V.O.) That's alright. I was just rambling. 
 (V.O.) No, no, really... you first... 
 Oh, uh... I just wanted to remind you about... 
 ...in Santa Barbara... 
 NED & LAURA (in unison) ..."How To Sue Your Loved Ones." 
 (V.O.) He's so cute. He can't even look me in the eye. 
 (touching his arm) What is it, Ned? You can tell me. 
 (hopeful) Really? 
 Oh... wow... golly... 
 (smiles, eager) Gosh... that might be okay. 
 (to Laura) Like some ice for your drink? 
 Does your wife know you're... "working" late? I certainly hope so, Mr. Ravine. 
 Hurry up, darling. You'll be late! 
 (whispering) It's all taken care of. When do I knock on the door? 
 Wait until I signal you. When I raise the blinds... you knock. 
 Not now! 
 Oh, later... right... okay. 
 Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye- bye to Little Ned. He loves his daddy... don't you Stink Pot? 
 What's wrong? 
 Why don't you catch the train to Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty minutes. 
 No! 
 I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists seized the airport this morning. A plane crashed into the tower... and all the runways are on fire! 
 And it's fogged in. 
 For my peace of mind... take the train. 
 Darling... it's only a short trip. 
 Just because both your parents died in a train wreck... 
 And your brother, Morty... 
 Right... 
 (very convincing) Coincidence, Ned. Beside... that's the past. They're gone. 
 That's right. 
 Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I don't want to raise a child in a home filled with fear! 
 But if you can conquer your fear... maybe I can conquer my fear of having a baby with a father who's fearful. (goes for broke) Ned... don't let a train kill our child before it's even conceived! 
 You're sure now...? 
 I was in the neighborhood. Thought I'd stop by and pick up my tools. 
 Frank will drive you. Won't you Frank? 
 Sure, I'll take you to the train station. 
 We'll make it! 
 Okay... now what're you going to do if you feel queasy going through the tunnel? 
 That's right. When you get queasy... go stand in the vestibule between the cars. 
 OH! My dear gracious! 
 SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish that foul smelling cigar? 
 (turning slowly) You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU want me to put out my cigar? You want ME to put out my CIGAR? 
 Yeah. 
 Certainly. 
 It's already getting to him. He'll be out of that seat and into the vestibule within ten minutes... I guarantee it. 
 You talkin' to me? You talkin' to ME? You... talkin'... to... ME? 
 Ticket? 
 Sorry pal... automatic weapons are only allowed in the club car after nine p.m. 
 I'll check it with baggage. You can claim it at the depot in Santa Barbara. 
 Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years old. Didja know if ya put a penny on the track it'll make the train crash? No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck? My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really neat. Everybody gets creamed! All bloody guts... heads ripped off and stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song "Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts"? 
 You want to earn a couple bucks, kid? 
 Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years old. Didja know if ya put a penny on the track it'll make the train crash? 
 He's losing it. You better get up to the next car. Remember, give me the high sign as soon as you see the river. It'll be two minutes and nine seconds past the tunnel. I'll take care of the rest. Anything goes wrong... just make sure you back me up. (grabs his collar) And don't let him see you. 
 Yes it is. 
 Here... let me help you with that. 
 What a nice young man. You are so polite. 
 (smiles) I try to be. 
 Great green gobs of greasy, grimy gopher guts... mutilated monkey meat... chopped up dirty birdie's feet... one pint jar of all-purpose porpoise pus... cooked in a Mulligan stew. 
 
 (still singing) French fried eyeballs and ugly scabs you wanna pick... stuff to make your mother sick... dog poop on a stick... puke and snot all mixed together in a pot... 
 Oh boy! Here comes the tunnel! 
 Way to go, Ned. Right on time. 
 You shootin' at me? 
 Yeah... you're definitely shootin' at me. 
 Ned... you wouldn't... 
 But... you said it yourself. I saved your life. 
 
 
 #1 What kind of gun did she use? 
 #2 Aren't you the arresting officer? 
 #1 But aren't you her attorney? 
 #3 What will Mrs. Ravine be wearing at the trial? 
 #3 Does it have a matching jacket? 
 #3 Is it cotton or rayon? 
 #1 (calling out) Did she eat any of the victim's body parts? 
 They're just doing their job. 
 Only cell available. They had that serial killer locked up here... you know, the one who talks his victims to death then eats them... Hannibal the Lecturer. But they let him out for a three week tour to publicize his new book. 
 It's a cookbook. 
 And look, look... he autographed it. 
 They're waiting for ya. They didn't want to start without her attorney being present. 
 PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could use a good exterminator. 
 # 2 (to Police Guard) Let's get the SWAT Team in here. 
 Can't you get me out of this cage, Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here. 
 1 It's your collar... your bust... your call... your show... your play... your move... your wife... 
 2 Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup allowed in this building. 
 What're you gonna do... arrest me for primping? 
 Well... 
? 
 I... 
 Yep. Both of 'em. 
 Yes. 
! 
 Yes! 
 YES! Cappelini pomodoro! 
 Pasta with tomato sauce. Whatsa matta? You don't like Italian? 
 I thought he might like to get out, so I took him to the amusement park. 
! 
 You haven't seen the last of me, Ned. 
 I told you. 
 (with choreography) Lana, Lana, she's the one Shot a bad guy with a gun Blew that sucker off a train Some guys are a friggin' pain YaaaaaAAAAAAAAY LANA! 
 Once again, Americans are making a mockery of their courts, turning a murder trial into a media circus! How can justice ever prevail when it is ridiculed and reviled in such a heinously revolting manner? This is Clement Von Franckenstein returning you to our BBC studios in London for the latest photographs of Lady Di naked in the bath. 
 What a great day for a trial! We have lots of incandescent lighting, seventy-two degrees inside... and no wind! 
 ANGLE - COURTROOM 
 Oy vay! Oy vay! Superior Court of Los Angeles is now in session. And here he is... direct from a triumphant one-week engagement in Las Vegas Circuit Court... the honorable... the venerable... the totally irrepressible... Judge Harlan Skan- kyyyyyyy! 
 Wow... has this defense team been HOT! Thirty-seven straight victories this year! Let's go down for the coin toss. 
 ANGLE - COURTROOM 
 (V.O.) The Prosecution wins the flip of the coin and elects to kick things off. 
 ...the prosecution will prove that this repulsive and degenerate woman coldly murdered a decent, law-abiding citizen... 
 Sustained. 
 Yes. It's a death threat that Max Shady FAXED to you on the day he was released from prison. 
 (jumps up) Objection! Who cares about the FAX in this case? 
 I'll allow it. 
 U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi! You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A- M-A! How you think you got that way? Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama! 
 Yes... it is. 
. 
 Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's check out the re-play. 
 Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide open! But instead of handing it off, Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh! The pass is wide! A real wobbler! There's no way! He scrambles, but he just can't get his hands on it... And RIGHT THERE!... (freezes the frame) ...WHAM! That blender is gone! 
 Ned... did you ever consider that maybe you don't know women as well as you think you do? 
 (O.S.) Now would you tell the court, in your own words, what you said to Mr. Ravine? 
 (singing) Great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts... mutilated monkey meat... itsy-bitsy birdie feet... Great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts... and me without a spoon! 
 (pointing at Lana) That lady paid me two bucks to sing it to him...! 
 Recess! Ten minutes! 
 Gotcha, dork face! Gotcha, gotcha! 
 No you didn't! 
 Recess is over! Let's go... move it, move it, move it! 
 There they go... the UCLA Marching Band! And now... Holy Toledo!... it looks like the victim's mother... Helen Shady... is gonna take the stand! This will be the first defensive play of the afternoon. 
 MRS. SHADY He was the best. And that's not just a mother talking. You can ask anybody. 
 MRS. SHADY Well, you know, pranks. Little jokes and things. But he was so cute. I have pictures! 
 MRS. SHADY Here. This is when he set the cat on fire... (then, assuring him) Oh... but the cat deserved it. 
 MRS. SHADY Marshmallows. He just loved to toast marshmallows over a roaring cat. Burned on the outside... all soft in the middle. (turns page) And right here... this was taken on the day he left the priesthood to join the Green Berets. 
 MRS. SHADY (laughs, delighted) Oh yes! That was during his Ku Klux Klan phase. He would take the sheets right off my bed... cut those little holes in them. What a stitch he was! 
 MRS. SHADY Why that shouldn't even be in there! It's his rotten little half-brother. (rips up photo) Stinkin' little pecker... he never was any good... 
 MRS. SHADY (points at another) Oh! I didn't like these neo-Nazi boys. They were all so fussy and persnickety about everything. Heil this and heil that. (flips the page) Oh look... here's Max with his chainsaw. He loved to go to the national park and cut down those giant old trees. It made him feel so patriotic. You know, if he hadn't been such a successful criminal... I think he would have been a lumberjack. 
 MRS. SHADY (tearful, angry) But now he'll never be anything! Not since... (stands up, points) ...that woman, your wife, pulled the trigger and put my little Max in his grave! 
 Mrs. Shady! Do not POINT your finger in my courtroom. It's discourteous, impolite and disrespectful. 
 MRS. SHADY Don't you tell me what to do with my finger! It's been more places than you've ever dreamed of! 
 (bangs gavel) Sit down! 
 MRS. SHADY I'll point my finger wherever I want! 
 Yeah. And I told him... "this is the NO SMOKING car! Would you please put out your damn cigar!" 
 I believe it is. 
 Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? 
 (looks to Judge) Do I have to answer that, Harlan? 
 No, no dear. I'll vouch for her. 
 No. Call me Angel Tits. 
 I object! 
 Sustained. Counselor... you will address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine. 
 I saw Max Shady at the station... saw him get on board. I knew he'd made threats to kill you and mutilate your reproductive organs... 
 ...so I got on the train too... so I could warn you. 
 Someday. With the right man. 
 It would be difficult. 
 Something like that. 
 And fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired... 
 ...and fired and fired and fired. 
 The jury's back! 
 (back to business) So... has the jury reached a verdict? 
 (stands up) Yes we have, your Honor. 
 How do you find the defendant... on the count of manslaughter? 
 Not guilty. 
 On the count of murder in the first degree? 
 Not guilty. 
 On the Count of Monte Cristo? 
 Not guilty. 
 Good. Then on the count of three, let's all get the hell out of here! One... two... 
 Wait... for... it... 
 Two and a half... THREE! 
 Well, counselor, looks like you won another case. Lucky for me. 
 (O.S.) (over P. A. system) Attention courtroom shoppers! All trial evidence now on sale. Forty to sixty percent off all exhibits! Everything must go! 
 I told you, Bernard... smoking cigars is bad for your hearing! 
 Mrs. Ravine! What can I do for ya? 
 How much for my gun? 
 I don't believe it! She just bought her gun back! The gun she used to kill a man! 
 So... you did it. Ya beat the rap. 
 No thanks to you. 
 Hey... I knew he'd spring ya. 
 You didn't lift a finger, Frank. You let me take all the heat. 
 Heeeee-eeey... what could I do? 
 You were gonna let me rot in the slammer... never say a thing. 
 Look... you're out... free. Now we're together. That's what counts. We can try again! Forget triple indemnity. We'll whack him and split three mil. 
 I'm not splitting anything, Frank. (cocks the gun) And you know too much. 
 (arrogant) Come on, Lana. You're not gonna shoot me. 
 You're right. (then, seductive) Maybe I'll just screw you to death. 
 Now you're talkin' baby. 
 
 Watch your step, guys. There's a lot of blood. 
 Looks like a suicide. We found a note. 
 It was stuck up his nose. 
 (reading it) "I can't take it anymore. I'm a mediocre mechanic... and a lousy lover." 
 Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um... 
 Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith. I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine. The big powerful kind that suck up everything in sight. I was just telling your wife, if she wants to get rid of all her dirt, she has to be willing to pay the price. 
 Let me know what you decide, Mrs. Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure meeting you... Ned. 
 I... hate... SALESMEN! 
 A trip? 
 (darkly inspired) I like that. Just you and me... all alone. I'll start packing. 
 Who is it? 
 Why didn't you say so? 
 Would you like a drink? 
 Then let's get to the point! 
 So what's your problem, tough guy? 
 (shocked) A VACATION! She doesn't deserve a VACATION! She's a brat! A bad girl! She always was and always will be! 
 I know EVERYTHING! 
 She's your wife! 
 She's my sister! 
 She's your wife! 
 She's my sister! 
 She's your wife... AND my sister! 
 She was spoiled rotten! She stole everything I ever had. Everything! Including him. 
 Dwayne. The boy's gym teacher. He was older. So mature... so strong. He smelled like dirty sweat socks and old basketballs. And he was all mine. For awhile. (turning bitter) But Lana wasn't satisfied with her own things. She had to have mine too. She took it all... my makeup, my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear... 
 We were identical twins. 
 Not anymore. One day I caught her stealing my lavender eye shadow and she smashed my face in with a shovel. I had fifty-three operations. When the doctors were finished with me... I looked like THIS! I'm ugly. UGLY! 
 Don't lie to me. 
 I look in the mirror. I can SEE! 
 Tell that to Dwayne. When he saw my face, he left me for HER... because she looked more like me than I did! First she stole my looks... then she stole the only man who ever loved me! 
 But I found a way to get even. The best revenge possible. Destroy her marriage! 
 You been hangin' out with Dick Tracy, haven't ya? 
 It doesn't matter. I'm blackmailing her for everything she's worth. She murdered that greasy auto mechanic. I saw her do it. 
 (also stunned) Kelbo! His name was Kelbo? 
 Dwayne's name was Kelbo. He had a son. Frankie Kelbo. 
 Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so much to tell you. 
 Thanks... I brought my own. 
 A lottery ticket and a laundry receipt. (lays them on table) I found them in the pocket of that suit you wore the night you were working under cover with a client. 
 You remember that night, don't ya Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L- O... L-A. Lola. 
 (shrugs it off) Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's mind works. 
 Fine. Then I remembered you told me some guy named Frank had been working on your wife's car for two months. You with me so far? 
 Well back it up. You probably took a wrong turn. Remember your insurance policy... the one we couldn't find? I started thinking, who else had access to it beside you and me? The answer came up... Lana. And since she's a woman, it's probably hidden right here. 
 Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your life when she shot Max Shady. She and Frank were plotting to kill you and collect on your insurance policy. But she shot the wrong guy. 
 (she presses on) Don't you see... Frank was going to let her take the fall. So she murdered him and tried to make it look like suicide. (beat) That's when I realized there was a connection between Lola and Lana... 
 Well, hang on to your jock strap, Ned. There's more. 
 Not only is Frank's father Dwayne Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher and Lola Cain's former lover... Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max and Frank are half-brothers who never met. 
 Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered both of Helen Shady's sons. 
 And you haven't even heard my story. 
 He turned into a monster. And that's when I left him. I just couldn't... 
 Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine. 
 I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a gig tonight. 
 LAURA'S HUSBAND Forget something, sweetheart? 
 LAURA'S HUSBAND You forgot to flush, darling. 
 What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me away? 
 I never forget anything... honey. 
 (outraged) Those are MY panties! 
 Oh Ned! 
 Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved you! 
 Got 'em! 
 I said... I GOT 'EM! 
?!!! 
 (yells) THEY'RE DEAD! GONE! KA-PUT! 
 Okay. But I want to have kids. 
 Ned... 
 Knock off the chatter, will ya? 
 We won't need you anymore. 
 We can make our own music. 
 (V.O.)
